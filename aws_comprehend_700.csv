The ASD had been diagnosed when the patient was 12 years old and TTE had suggested that the right ventricle was dilating. At cardiac catheterisation there were mildly elevated right ventricular systolic pressures and a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of over two. The secundum ASD was estimated to be 15 mm wide using TTE with aneurysmal formation of the interatrial septum. The patient was admitted for percutaneous ASD closure and underwent uncomplicated placement of a 17 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during the procedure revealed the presence of a second ASD near the inferior vena cava and a small post-procedure shunt. The septal occluder did not completely cover both defects. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose (assuming a single posteroanterior projection chest x-ray is eight centi-Gray/cm2) was 400. Repeat TTE continued to demonstrate left to right shunting and the patient was readmitted for a further device closure six months later. At cardiac catheterisation, the second defect was identified low in the secundum septum between the fossa ovalis and the mouth of the coronary sinus. The defect was successfully closed with a 9 mm Amplatzer septal occluder with no evidence of obstructed flow in either the coronary sinus or the inferior vena cava. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the second procedure was 187.

The defect was estimated to be 10 mm wide on TTE with evidence of right atrial and right ventricular dilatation. Left atrial size was normal. She was referred was further investigation and treatment. Cardiac catheterisation demonstrated a pulmonary to systemic flow shunt of four to one. Peri-procedure TEE revealed that there were two defects; one measuring 24 mm located inferiorly between the inferior vena cava and coronary sinus os with the second defect situated superiorly and measuring 30 mm. The inferior defect was closed using a 24 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose was 403. The patient was discharged the following day and readmitted three months later for closure of the superior defect. This was performed using a 30 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. The procedure was technical difficult as after deployment of the left sided disc, the device initially lay obliquely in the defect. The final position was satisfactory with no evidence of intra-cardiac shunting (figure ). There was no interference between the two devices and mitral valve function remained normal.

3,503399-1,15272940,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC503399.xml,A unique dedifferentiated tumor of the retroperitoneum,"A 65-year-old male presented with a three-week history of progressively worsening abdominal distension. He denied any abdominal pain but stated that he noticed an increased frequency of bowel movements. His past medical history was unremarkable. On examination, he was afebrile and had a hugely distended abdomen with an immobile, nontender mass occupying all four quadrants of the abdomen. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a large, heterogeneous lobulated mass occupying most of the abdomen (Figure ). The peripheral component appeared lipomatous and the margins of this component were difficult to estimate accurately. There was also a heterogeneous nonlipomatous component that contained areas of lesser density, as well as a central stellate region of calcifications. The preoperative differential diagnosis included a retroperitoneal sarcoma (especially dedifferentiated liposarcoma), desmoid tumor, undifferentiated carcinoma, carcinoid or sclerosing mesenteritis; lymphoma was also considered.
While neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation comprise a frequent approach for retroperitoneal sarcomas at our institution, the extent of the tumor made this approach unfeasible. Resection was therefore planned unless an intraoperative biopsy revealed lymphoma. Resection was accomplished through a T-type incision (Figure ), and entailed removal of the right kidney, terminal ileum, ascending colon, sigmoid colon and the left spermatic cord structures, all of which were intimately attached to the mass. Encasement of the external iliac artery and vein was also encountered near the end of the procedure. This was not fully appreciated preoperatively, as that component of the tumor was so much less conspicuous on CT than the rest of the tumor, given its fatty consistency (Figure ). The mass was split in half to facilitate dissection from the iliac vessels. An anastomosis was constructed from descending colon to rectum. A transverse colon mucous fistula and an ileostomy were brought out, as the ileum was dusky at the end of the procedure.
The tumor was submitted for histological examination in two parts measuring, 30.0 × 10.0 × 6.5 cm and 32.0 × 20.0 × 10.0 cm, weighing 19.8 kg in total (Figure ). On gross examination the mass was variegated, with fleshy and solid cystic degeneration containing areas of osseous consistency. Microscopic examination revealed a juxtaposition of well differentiated liposarcoma and a spindle cell sarcoma with heterologous chondrosarcomatous elements consistent with a dedifferentiated liposarcoma (Figure ).
The patient was discharged from hospital on the seventh postoperative day. He was followed in the surgical oncology outpatient clinic monthly. Four months after resection the patient had a follow-up CT scan, which demonstrated an intra-abdominal recurrence consisting almost completely of a calcified, nonlipomatous tumor (Figure ). The patient died one month later.","[[65.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['abdominal', 'abdominal', 'bowel', 'abdomen', 'all four quadrants of the abdomen', 'abdomen', 'peripheral component', 'margins of this component', 'central stellate region', 'retroperitoneal', 'retroperitoneal', 'right kidney', 'terminal ileum', 'ascending colon', 'sigmoid colon', 'left spermatic cord structures', 'external iliac artery', 'vein', 'iliac vessels', 'descending colon to rectum', 'transverse colon mucous', 'ileum', 'spindle cell', 'intra-abdominal']","['abdominal distension', 'abdominal pain', 'bowel movements', 'unremarkable', 'afebrile', 'distended abdomen', 'mass', 'mass', 'lipomatous', 'heterogeneous nonlipomatous component', 'areas of lesser density', 'calcifications', 'retroperitoneal sarcoma', 'liposarcoma', 'desmoid tumor', 'carcinoma', 'carcinoid', 'sclerosing mesenteritis', 'lymphoma', 'retroperitoneal sarcomas', 'tumor', 'lymphoma', 'mass', 'Encasement', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'mass', 'transverse colon mucous fistula', 'ileum was dusky', 'tumor', 'mass', 'cystic degeneration', 'areas of osseous consistency', 'differentiated liposarcoma', 'liposarcoma', 'spindle cell sarcoma', 'heterologous chondrosarcomatous elements', 'dedifferentiated liposarcoma', 'intra-abdominal recurrence', 'calcified', 'nonlipomatous tumor', 'died']",[],"['65', 'surgical oncology outpatient clinic']","['Computed tomographic (CT) scan', 'neoadjuvant chemotherapy', 'radiation', 'Resection', 'intraoperative biopsy', 'intraoperative biopsy', 'Resection', 'removal of the right kidney, terminal ileum, ascending colon, sigmoid colon and the left spermatic cord structures', 'procedure', 'CT', 'mass was split in half to facilitate dissection from the iliac vessels', 'anastomosis was constructed from descending colon to rectum', 'transverse colon mucous fistula and an ileostomy were brought out', 'ileostomy', 'procedure', 'histological examination', 'weighing', 'Microscopic examination', 'resection', 'CT scan']","['three-week', 'preoperative', 'Four months', 'one month later']"

The swelling measured 2 × 1 cm placed in the superficial part of the parotid and was not fixed. There was no facial nerve palsy or palpable cervical nodes. A fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was carried out which showed the lesion to be ACC []. The clinical staging was T1, N0, M0. The patient underwent a total conservative parotidectomy after metastatic work up. Histopathology revealed ACC with cribriform pattern and perineural invasion (Figure ). 60 Gy adjuvant external beam radiotherapy was administered post-operatively to the parotid area and the neck. Patient was placed on regular follow-up. Three years after primary surgery, patient presented with heaviness and pain in the right hypochondrium of 15 days duration. Patient was anicteric and abdominal examination revealed firm nodular and non tender enlargement of the liver. There was no ascites. Surgical site and neck were clinically normal. Chest roentgenogram was normal. Ultrasonography (US) of the abdomen revealed multiple metastatic lesions scattered in both lobes (Figure ). Liver function tests were normal and an US guided FNAC revealed metastatic ACC (Figure ). Since the lesions were multiple and scattered over both lobes of liver, surgical option was not considered and the patient was offered palliative chemotherapy which she declined. She developed pedal edema and abdominal distention 20 months after detection of liver metastasis. On clinical examination, patient was anicteric but liver had increased in size and abdomen showed evidence of a little free fluid. Chest CT scan was normal.

The patient noted that the urticaria began at the age of 12, and did not seem to have any obvious trigger. Each individual lesion would last from 12–24 hours, and the entire episode would last 5–10 days. Lesions would usually start on the chest and then spread over the entire body. She had seen multiple physicians, including allergists and dermatologists, and had been treated with a variety of medications including certirizine, desloratadine, hydroxyzine, montelukast, ranitidine, and diphenhydramine without relief. Prednisone at high doses would provide temporary relief, and she had required multiple courses of prednisone over the past 20 years. In addition, she complained of occasional angioedema, usually at the same time as the hives but occasionally occurring when hives were not present. The patient also had acne that had been very difficult to control since her teenage years, and she noted that the acne would also respond to prednisone.
Multiple lab tests over the years had been unremarkable. These included SSA/SSB, anti-Smith, ACE level, C3/C4, hepatitis B, ANA, anti double-stranded DNA, immunoglobulins, SPEP, C1 esterase inhibitor level and function, chemistry panel, liver tests, TSH, T4, thyroid antibodies, rheumatoid factor, ESR, and CBC. Skin biopsy of a lesion had been read as ""chronic urticaria"".
Upon further questioning, it was learned that due to the patient's endometriosis, she had very irregular menstrual cycles in terms of length and timing. It was determined that the hives and/or angioedema would begin approximately 4 days prior to the onset of menses, and would last about 2 days into menses. The symptoms would not occur with every episode of menses. The patient's acne would often occur on her face during the urticarial episodes. Of note, the patient had 2 children, and during each pregnancy her hives, acne, and angioedema had been markedly improved. Because of her endometriosis, she had been started on Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) in her twenties. After 1 injection, she developed severe hives that lasted over 2 months and required multiple courses of prednisone. Due to the urticaria, Depo-Provera was discontinued after one injection. As the patient complained of acne, Ortho Tri-Cyclen (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol) was initiated by her dermatologist. This treatment modality did not have any effect on the urticaria, angioedema, or acne.
The patient was evaluated in our clinic. Physical examination was essentially normal, and no hives were noted. Allergy skin testing was performed with progesterone 50 mg/mL in normal saline. Prick test was normal, but a full strength intradermal test revealed a 7 mm wheal with erythema. The histamine control showed a 9 mm wheal with erythema, and saline control was negative for wheal and erythema. Two healthy controls also underwent intradermal testing to exclude irritant reaction, and were found to be negative
Based on the above results, the patient was diagnosed with autoimmune progesterone dermatitis. The patient was started on a GnRH agonist (nafarelin acetate nasal spray, 200 mcg twice a day). Within one month, she noted dramatic improvement in her urticaria and angioedema. Acne was still occasionally present, but much improved. She did complain of mild hot flashes, but felt these were tolerable.","[[33.0, 'year']]",F,2004,"['chest', 'entire body', 'liver', 'thyroid', 'Skin', 'face', 'skin', 'intradermal', 'intradermal', 'nasal']","['endometriosis', 'urticaria', 'urticaria', 'lesion', 'Lesions', 'angioedema', 'hives', 'hives', 'acne', 'acne', 'lesion', 'urticaria', 'endometriosis', 'menstrual cycles', 'hives', 'angioedema', 'menses', 'symptoms', 'menses', 'acne', 'urticarial episodes', 'pregnancy', 'hives', 'acne', 'angioedema', 'endometriosis', 'hives', 'urticaria', 'acne', 'effect', 'effect on the urticaria', 'urticaria', 'angioedema', 'acne', 'hives', 'wheal', 'erythema', 'wheal', 'erythema', 'wheal', 'erythema', 'irritant reaction', 'autoimmune progesterone dermatitis', 'urticaria', 'angioedema', 'Acne', 'hot flashes']","['certirizine', 'desloratadine', 'hydroxyzine', 'montelukast', 'ranitidine', 'diphenhydramine', 'Prednisone', 'prednisone', 'prednisone', 'Depo-Provera', 'medroxyprogesterone acetate', 'prednisone', 'Depo-Provera', 'Ortho Tri-Cyclen', 'norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol', 'progesterone', 'normal saline', 'nafarelin acetate']","['33y', '12']","['medications', 'lab tests', 'SSA/SSB', 'anti-Smith', 'ACE level', 'C3/C4', 'hepatitis B', 'ANA', 'anti double-stranded DNA', 'immunoglobulins', 'SPEP', 'C1 esterase inhibitor level and function', 'chemistry panel', 'liver tests', 'TSH', 'T4', 'thyroid antibodies', 'rheumatoid factor', 'ESR', 'CBC', 'Skin biopsy of a lesion', 'treatment', 'Physical examination', 'Allergy skin testing', 'Prick test', 'full strength intradermal test', 'histamine control', 'saline control', 'intradermal testing', 'GnRH agonist']","['since her teenage years', 'over the years', '4 days', '4 days', 'prior to the onset of menses', 'prior to the onset of menses', 'last about 2 days into menses', 'last about 2 days into menses', 'over 2 months', 'Within one month', 'Within one month']"

He had a past medical history of cerebral palsy and spastic quadriparesis. Three years ago, he had an ITB pump implanted for spasticity refractory to the high doses of oral baclofen. He had a significant improvement in spasticity, social and functional capacity in the past three years.
Later, he developed some disorientation and increased spasticity. He was taken to a local physician who prescribed oral baclofen (120 mg daily in four divided doses) for his increased spasticity. He also advised him to have his ITB pump checked immediately. The following day, his spasticity increased even after taking oral baclofen. He developed multiple seizures and respiratory distress in the next 24-hour period. Subsequently, he was admitted in a local hospital where he was orally intubated and transferred to our ICU for aggressive management.
On presentation, his temperature was 104.6°F (40.3°C), heart rate 127 beats per minute, and the blood pressure was 85/45 mm/Hg. His ventilator settings were: assist-control ventilation mode; respiratory rate, 15 breaths per minute; tidal volume, 650 mL; positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), 5 cm H2O; and FiO2, 60%. His spontaneous respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100% was noted on pulse oximetry. In the local hospital, he was documented to have a high fever of 107°F (41.6°C) and he had received intravenous lorazepam, phenytoin, pantoprazole, piperacillin/tazobactem and dopamine. On physical examination, neurologically he was unconscious with decerebrate posturing and his Glasgow coma scale was 6. He had an absent corneal and gag reflexes. He was moving all four limbs in response to noxious stimuli. He was also noted to have an extreme spasticity in all four limbs. Lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the left lower base. Cardiac examination was unremarkable. He had a palpable baclofen pump on abdominal wall and bowel sounds were heard. The differential diagnoses were septic shock, meningitis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and malignant hyperthermia.
The initial laboratory results showed serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) 5250 U/L (Normal, 25–235 U/L) and CPK-MB fraction 12.1 ng/ml (Normal, 0.5–6.3 U/L). Serum chemistry revealed sodium 142 mmol/L, potassium 5.1 mmol/L, chloride 120 mmol/L, bicarbonate 13 mmol/L, and creatinine 2.1 mg/dl. Hemogram showed white blood cell count 12.2 K/UL, hemoglobin 16.5 g/dl and platelet count 9 K/UL (Normal, 130–400 K/UL). Liver function test showed aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) 1128 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (AST) 1140 U/L, alkaline phophatase 90 U/L, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dl, conjugated bilirubin 0.7 mg/dl, prothrombin time 20.2 seconds (Normal, 10–12.5 seconds), and INR 2.0 (Normal, 0.9–1.1). Blood and urine cultures were obtained. Chest radiograph was normal. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed atelectasis of the left lung base. His CT scan of head did not show any acute infarct or bleeding. His initial management included intravenous fluids, norepinephrine, platelet transfusion, phenytoin, propofol and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone) for suspected meningitis and septic shock. He received intravenous lorazepam (4–8 mg every four hours) for his spasticity. Next day, his spasticity improved and an ITB specialist investigated his baclofen pump. His baclofen pump analysis revealed that it was stopped due to some programming error, which was restarted at a previously prescribed baclofen rate (260 μg/day).
On third hospital day, his serum CPK was 15,878 U/L, AST was 2566 U/L, ALT was 2993 U/L, while CPK-MB fraction came down to 3.4 ng/ml. His urine output decreased (<400 ml/ day) and serum creatinine increased in the range of 5–6 mg/dl. Later, he was hemodialyzed few times during the course of hospitalization due to acute renal failure. His echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 20–25% and severe global hypokinesis. His electroencephalogram did not reveal any epileptogenic activity. He developed full-blown multisystem organ failure with an evidence of shock liver, renal failure, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation and myocardial depression. His nutrition was started on nasogastric tube feedings, and proper ventilator care was taken through a tracheostomy tube.

Duodenoscopy (Figure ) and hypotonic duodenography (Figure ) revealed a 3 × 3 cm protruding tumor with two ulcerations located opposite the ampulla of Vater in the second part of the duodenum. Laboratory data showed no abnormalities in blood chemistry, tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9, NSE, proGRP) and endocrine markers (somatostatin, gastrin, glucagons, serotonin, VIP) except a moderate anemia (9.5 g/dl hemoglobin). No abnormal findings were observed in the chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT).
A laparotomy was performed. As there was no serosal invasion or regional lymphadenopathy wide local excision of the tumor was performed. On gross examination, the tumor showed two ulcerations and two different morphological components (Figure and ). One component (component A) was round in shape with a round ulceration on the top, and the other component (component B), which enclosed the round component, was crescent in shape with a spindle-shaped ulceration on the top. The two components showed different histopathological and immunohistochemical features (Table ). The round component contained fibrous tissue, small nuclei, and clear nucleoli. Histopathologically, the crescent component had more anaplastic features typical of small-cell carcinoma, such as sheets of tightly packed anaplastic cells with round nuclei and scanty cytoplasm (Figure , ). Neuroendocrine differentiation was investigated using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural techniques. Both components showed neuroendocrine features, with immunochemistry identifying synaptophysin and AE1/AE3 (Figure and ), and electron microscopy identifying dense core granules (Figure ). Immunochemistry also showed that the crescent component expressed less cytokeratin, vimentin and CD56, and more MIB-1 than the round component.
The patient was discharged three weeks after operation with uneventful postoperative period. Four cycles of monthly adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluoro uracil (5-FU) (325 mg/m2) and leucovorin (20 mg/m2) were administered.

She has been experiencing chest pain for four months which has not increased in frequency or duration since it started. She denied pain at rest, nocturnal pain, difficulty breathing, or palpitations. An echocardiographic stress examination revealed significant ischemia with anteroseptal hypokinesia. Cardiac chambers were morphologically normal. The ""baseline"" echocardiography and stress echo was unsuspicious of a left atrial myxoma (Fig. ).
Coronary angiography revealed coronary artery disease with a stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) near the left main stem. A stent was implanted in the proximal LAD with no residual stenosis. The ventricle was morphologically normal.
A coronary angiography performed 13 months after stent implantation showed no re-stenosis and a normal left ventricle. No echocardiogram was performed at this time 32 months after the control coronary angiography, the patient was readmitted because of increasing dyspnoea and palpitations. A transthoracic echocardiography disclosed a big (70 × 30 mm) mass in the left atrium attached to the interatrial septum. The tumor prolapsed into the left ventricle obstructing the mitral valve orifice (Fig ). The mean pressure gradient across the mitral valve was 8 mm Hg.
A subsequent coronary angiography and LV and RV catheterization detected a mean diastolic pressure gradient of 12 mm Hg between the pulmonary capillary wedge and the left ventricular enddiastolic pressure, and no re-stenosis of the LAD stent. The angiography was notable for a large area with small atypical, tortuous vessels in the region of the interatrial septum. These vessels were shown to originate from branches of the right coronary artery (RCA) and the circumflex coronary artery (RCX). (Fig. )
Surgery was promptly performed and the tumor was successfully excised. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of a cardiac myxoma.

The patient had noted a sudden increase in the size of the lump over the preceding two months. He did not report any neck pressure symptoms, weight loss or anorexia. His past history included right partial thyroidectomy for a solitary nodule (colloid goitre) in 1978 and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm in 1994. He had suffered myocardial infarction in 1995 and had an episode of acute coronary insufficiency in January 2003. His recent coronary angiograms showed an occluded left anterior descending artery and echocardiogram revealed good left ventricular function. He was a non-smoker and consumed alcohol in moderation. He had been taking warfarin, diltiazem MR, lisinopril, uniphyllin, glyceryl trinitrate tablets and buccal suscard.
On examination he had left sided goitre extending superiorly into the posterior triangle and inferiorly into the retrosternal space, with variable consistency. The trachea was deviated to the right and there was cervical lymphadenopathy on the left side. Systemic examination was unremarkable and fine needle aspiration of thyroid gland showed presence of Hürthle cells. Computerised tomographic (CT) scan with contrast enhancement (figure &) of the neck and thorax revealed large left sided thyroid goitre with significant mediastinal extension. It showed mixed attenuation with foci of calcification peripherally. There was a 3 cm complex mass on the left side of the neck, posterior to the carotid sheath structures and deep to the sternomastoid, indicative of lymph node metastases. Thyroid profile and routine blood investigations were unremarkable.
Based on the above findings radical surgery was planned. On exploration of the neck we confirmed left goitre with intrathoracic extension and enlarged lymph nodes under the sternocleidomastoid close to the jugulodigastric muscle and surrounding the carotid sheath. There was no remnant thyroid tissue seen on the right side following the previous thyroid surgery. Left hemithyroidectomy with modified neck dissection (lymphadenectomy, preserving all vessels and nerves) was performed. Macroscopic examination of the thyroid lobe showed a well defined solid pale brown mass approximately 8 cm in maximum dimension, surrounded by a narrow rim of preserved thyroid tissue. The lymph node specimen comprised of several nodules of partly necrotic tissue. Microscopic examination showed the thyroid lobe containing a Hürthle cell neoplasm, which was mostly encapsulated, with foci of capsular and vascular invasion. The two lymph nodes revealed metastatic Hürthle cell carcinoma. [pT3, N1a, Mx], (Figure &).
The patient had adjuvant therapy with oral radioiodine 131 (3060 MBq Sodium Iodine). He was put on a daily dose of 100 mcg of thyroxine.

He had a known history of intravenous cocaine abuse and recent serology in prior 3 months was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Results of a physical examination showed signs of tachypnea, tachycardia, accessory muscle use and left lung base crackles. Tympanic temperature was 34.7°C. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable except for urethral meatus stenosis.
Initial laboratory investigations are presented in Table . Arterial blood gases showed pH of 6.95, PaCO2 10 mmHg, PaO2 109 mmHg, HCO3 2 mmol/L, and lactate 0.6 mmol/L consistent with high anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 587 μmol/L and 46.7 mmol/L, respectively. Toxicology and drug screen was negative. The metabolic acidosis was partially accounted for by acute renal failure with retained unmeasured anions and ketonemia. Urinalysis showed pyuria. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm.
Chest radiograph revealed right middle lobe and lingular patchy opacification. An abdomino-pelvic CT scan demonstrated moderate to severe bilateral hydronephrosis, bladder wall thickening with multiple diverticuli, and retroperitoneal streaking consistent with acute infection. A provisional diagnosis of severe sepsis was made with multiple potential foci of infection. The patient was given empiric ceftriaxone, metronidazole and vancomycin. Sputum specimen cultured heavy methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, blood cultures were positive for S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Group B Streptococcus. Urine cultured greater than 108 CFU/L of multiple gram positive and negative organisms.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The metabolic acidosis persisted (pH 7.00) a despite 100 mEq of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate bolus and infusion of three liters of normal bicarbonate solution (150 mEq of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate in 1000 mL D5W). The patient had a suprapubic bladder catheter inserted by angiography. However, due to concern the patient remained oliguric following 4 L crystalloid resuscitation, hemodialysis was organized. Hemodialysis parameters included: F160 membrane (surface area 1.5 m2 and KUf 50 mL/hr/mmHg), dialysate sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 3 mmol/L, calcium 1.25 mmol/L, bicarbonate 40 mmol/L, and QD 500 mL/min, QB 250–300 mL/min via a 25 cm left femoral double-lumen Uldall catheter. The patient had 71.5 L of blood processed over four hours with no fluid removal. Although the patient was alert and appropriate (Glasgow Coma Scale 15) with tachycardia and stable normal range blood pressure before the initiation of dialysis, he was demonstrating an increased work of breathing and oxygen requirements suggestive of worsening sepsis syndrome. Approximately 2.5 hrs after start of dialysis the patient became rapidly unresponsive prompting intubation for airway protection. At completion of HD and over the subsequent 4 hours the patient's neurologic status deteriorated with evidence of loss of all brainstem reflexes. Head CT-scan is shown in Figure .
Repeat laboratory investigations immediately following hemodialysis revealed a pH 7.36, HCO3 19 mmol/L, sodium 132 mmol/L, potassium 1.8 mmol/L, and urea 13.7 mmol/L (urea-reduction-ratio was 71%) (Table ).
The patient rapidly progressed to refractory shock and multi-organ dysfunction Diagnosis of brain death was declared independently by an intensivist and a neurologist. At autopsy, the brain showed evidence of diffuse cerebral edema. Cardiac assessment showed left ventricular enlargement consistent with systemic hypertension likely as a result of chronic kidney disease. Both lungs showed patchy acute bronchopneumonia with edema and congestion. Both kidneys appeared grossly pyonephrotic with dilated, thickened ureters and suggested the presence of acute on chronic pyelonephritis.

The lesions consisted of whitish papules and depressed areas with central protrusion.
On clinical examination, the otherwise healthy looking patient's general appearance and mental state had lumbar lordosis, laxity in large joints, tibia vara, high-arched palate, and dental misalignment. Skin lesions consisted of scattered, white to skin-colored papules, less than 1 centimeter in diameter, and with central protrusion, that were distributed on the dorsum of fingers (Fig ), forearms (Fig ), distal portion of the thighs and on the calves (Fig ). No lesions on the trunk or proximal areas of extremities were detected. Palms, soles, dorsum of feet and mucosal membranes were spared. No sensory changes associated with the lesions. He did not have any history of medication consumption. Family history was negative.
Laboratory examinations consisting of complete blood count, urinalysis, and blood chemistry including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and liver function tests were within normal limits. Antinuclear antibody was negative. The patient had no risk factor for AIDS or syphilis, so we did not request HIV or VDRL test. Hepatitis B surface antigens were not detected.

There was no associated breast pain, skin change or nipple discharge. There was no history of bone pain, weight loss, fatigue, fever or other systemic complaints and no family history of breast cancer. Significant past medical history included treatment for an extramedullary retrosternal plasmacytoma 5-years prior this admission.
At the time of the initial work-up for the retrosternal mass, immunoelectrophoresis showed no evidence for hyperproteinemia or paraproteinemia. Whole body bone scan was negative and a bone marrow biopsy revealed less than 5% of plasma cells. Therefore, multiple myeloma was excluded by nuclear medicine, laboratory and histology studies. The patient underwent radiation therapy (40 Gy with fraction size of 200 cGy delivered over 4 weeks) followed by chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, cisplatin and prednisolone. The patient was followed by laboratory tests, chest roentgenography, and computed tomography annually. A bone scintigraphy was carried out after 2 years and showed no uptake patient was thereafter lost to follow-up.
Five years after initial diagnosis of extramedullary plasmacytoma the patient presented with bilateral breast masses. Physical examination revealed a 3.5 cm × 2.5 cm, mass in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast and a similar 5.0 cm × 4.5 cm mass in the lower inner quadrant of the left breast. No asymmetry, skin dimpling or signs of inflammation were present. There was no axillary or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Mammography confirmed a well-defined 3.2 cm oval-shaped mass in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast, and a lobulated 5.5 cm density in lower inner quadrant of the left breast without any tissue distortion, inflammation and fibrotic reaction.(Figure ) There were no microcalcification and satellite lesions. These masses were solid and hypoechoeic with multiple septations in sonography.
Excisional biopsy of the masses revealed a 5.0 (left) and 3.0 (right) well-defined, capsulated gritty mass surrounded by normal breast tissue. There was no extension from the capsulated masses to pectoral muscles or chest wall. Histopathological examination showed high-grade tumors composed of immature and mature plasma cells. Mitosis, necrosis, nuclear pleomorphism and binucleated and multinucleated plasma cells were seen. (Figure ) Additional studies such as serum protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis were normal. No Bence Jones or other M components were detected in the urine. Skeletal surveys (Tc99 bone scan and skull and pelvic X-rays) did not show any pathological changes. There was no evidence of anemia, hypercalcemia or renal insufficiency. However, the patient refused a second bone marrow biopsy.
Immunohistochemical studies were performed on the paraffin embedded tissues to determine if the infiltrate had monoclonal character. The tumor cells were diffusely and strongly positive for lambda chains but negative for kappa chains. (Figure )
The tumor cells were weakly positive for monoclonal mouse anti human placental V538C, and plasma cell markers (CD138). Nuclear prognostic marker (Ki67) showed 50% to 80% nuclear expression indicative of high proliferative activity and suggesting a plasmacytic tumor with anaplastic components (Figure ). Other immunohistochemical stains including CD21, cytokeratin, S100, and HMB45 were negative.

16,517498-1,15294025,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC517498.xml,"Liver, spleen, pancreas and kidney involvement by human fascioliasis: imaging findings","In Dec 2001, a 52 year old man, who was a known case of Multiple Myeloma (MM), was presented to one of our affiliated hospitals with persistent right upper quadrant and epigastric pain, and anorexia for a period of 1 month. At the time of admission, the patient had been receiving prednisolone and melphalan for his MM, which was currently in remission. His recent condition began with tongue and facial edema two weeks before appearance of the abdominal pain.
Upon physical examination, mild epigastric tenderness and a palpable liver were found. Neither icterus nor any positive sign of cardiopulmonary abnormalities were noted. Additionally, the patient did not have a fever and his peripheral lymph nodes were not enlarged. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: a hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, white blood cell count of 10,800/mm3 with 18% eosinophils, and a sedimentation rate of 90 mm at the end of the first hour. The total bilirubin was 0.5 mg/dL (0.2–0.8 mg/dl), alanine aminotranferase (ALT) 48 IU/L (0–40 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 46 IU/L (0–40 IU/L), and alkaline phosphatase (Alk P) 651 IU/L (60–140 IU/L). The eosinophilia fluctuated between 12 to 55 percent in various tests performed during the time period in question, with no unique patterns noted. Serum electrophoresis showed a monoclonal spike in the gamma region. Specific enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) produced a positive result for Fasciola hepatica, while the test was negative for Toxocara canis. Serologic tests for the presence of hepatitis A, B, and C viruses were negative. Blood and urine cultures were found to be sterile. Other laboratory studies, including repeated stool examinations for ova and parasites, showed no abnormalities. Chest x-rays did not demonstrate any parenchymal or pleural abnormality. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a mild hepatomegaly with multiple hypoechoic lesions in the liver. A CT scan revealed multiple but poorly defined, hypodense lesions in the liver, and a completely enlarged pancreas with mild bilateral pleural reaction, suggesting metastatic cancer (Fig. 1). In the search for a potential malignancy, diagnostic laprascopy was performed, which revealed the presence of white-colored lesions ranging from 1 to 3 cm in diameter on the surface of both lobes of the liver with mild ascites. Multiple liver and peritoneal biopsy specimens revealed fibrinoid necrosis, associated with granulomatous reaction and a high concentration of eosinophils in the liver, (Fig. 2) accompanied by markedly inflamed peritoneal tissue with eosniphilic infiltration. No malignant cells were identified and no evidence of extramedulary plasmocytoma was found. Specific staining for fungal organisms and acid-fast bacilli were negative. The ascitic fluid also had a high level of eosinophils. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) failed to show any filling defect within the biliary tree. Furthermore, the patient underwent bone marrow aspiration that only indicated high eosniophilic infiltration. The patient was placed on albendazole (400 mg twice daily for 1 week). The treatment was well tolerated and the abdominal pain was improved rapidly. At the time of discharge, the patient was in good clinical condition. During a follow-up visit two months later, a second CT unexpectedly showed not only an increase in the number and size of the hypodense lesions in the liver, but also the extension of lesions into the pancreas, the spleen and both kidneys (Fig. 3). No evidence of peripheral enhancement of the hepatic lesions or ascites was documented. The patient was still experiencing upper quadrant pain on the right side. Laboratory investigations produced a white blood cell count of 7200/mm3 with 16% eosinophilia. Repeated stool examinations failed to identify ova and parasites. The patient was given triclabendazole (10 mg/kg, bid for two days). As recommended, the patient had another follow-up CT scan three months later. At that time all of his symptoms were resolved. Follow-up CT scans revealed a considerable improvement in the number and size of the lesions. At the time of the CT scan, all of his symptoms were resolved (Fig. 4A, B). At this time the WBC was 6000/mm3 with 6% eosinophils. After 5 months and in the last CT, the lesions had almost disappeared completely (Fig. 4C, D).","[[52.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['right upper quadrant', 'epigastric', 'tongue', 'facial', 'abdominal', 'epigastric', 'liver', 'cardiopulmonary', 'peripheral lymph nodes', 'gamma region', 'ova', 'parasites', 'Chest', 'parenchymal', 'pleural', 'Abdominal', 'liver', 'liver', 'pancreas', 'bilateral pleural', 'surface of both lobes of the liver', 'liver', 'peritoneal', 'fibrinoid', 'liver', 'peritoneal tissue', 'extramedulary', 'biliary tree', 'bone marrow', 'abdominal', 'liver', 'pancreas', 'spleen', 'both kidneys', 'hepatic', 'upper quadrant', 'ova']","['Multiple Myeloma', 'MM', 'pain', 'anorexia', 'MM', 'edema', 'abdominal pain', 'epigastric tenderness', 'palpable liver', 'icterus', 'cardiopulmonary abnormalities', 'fever', 'enlarged', 'eosinophilia', 'unique patterns', 'monoclonal spike', 'Fasciola hepatica', 'Toxocara canis', 'hepatitis A, B, and C viruses', 'abnormalities', 'abnormality', 'hepatomegaly', 'hypoechoic lesions', 'hypodense lesions', 'enlarged pancreas', 'bilateral pleural reaction', 'metastatic cancer', 'malignancy', 'lesions', 'ascites', 'fibrinoid necrosis', 'granulomatous reaction', 'eosinophils', 'inflamed peritoneal tissue', 'eosniphilic infiltration', 'malignant cells', 'extramedulary plasmocytoma', 'fungal organisms', 'acid-fast bacilli', 'ascitic fluid', 'eosinophils', 'filling defect', 'eosniophilic infiltration', 'treatment was well tolerated', 'abdominal pain', 'good clinical condition', 'hypodense lesions', 'extension of lesions', 'peripheral enhancement', 'peripheral enhancement of the hepatic lesions', 'ascites', 'upper quadrant pain', 'ova', 'parasites', 'symptoms', 'number and size of the lesions', 'symptoms', 'lesions']","['prednisolone', 'melphalan', 'albendazole', 'triclabendazole']","['Dec 2001', '52']","['physical examination', 'laboratory', 'hemoglobin', 'white blood cell', 'white blood cell count', 'eosinophils', 'sedimentation rate', 'total bilirubin', 'alanine aminotranferase', 'eosinophilia', 'tests', 'Serum electrophoresis', 'Specific enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA)', 'ELISA', 'test', 'Serologic tests', 'Blood and urine cultures', 'laboratory studies', 'stool examinations', 'stool examinations for ova and parasites', 'Chest x-rays', 'Abdominal ultrasonography', 'CT scan', 'diagnostic laprascopy', 'laprascopy', 'biopsy', 'Specific staining for fungal organisms and acid-fast bacilli', 'acid-fast bacilli', 'Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography', 'ERCP', 'bone marrow aspiration', 'treatment', 'CT', 'Laboratory', 'white blood cell count', 'eosinophilia', 'stool examinations', 'CT scan', 'CT scans', 'CT scan', 'WBC', 'eosinophils', 'CT']","['1 month', '1 month', 'At the time', 'At the time of admission', 'At the time of admission', 'recent', 'two weeks', 'At the time of discharge', 'two months later', 'three months later', 'At that time', 'At the time', 'At this time', 'After 5 months']"

The patient did not have a history of abnormal calcium metabolism, or hyperparathyroidism. Upon listing his serum ionized calcium was 1.07 mmol/L. The donor was a previously healthy, 42-year-old male, who suffered intracranial bleeding following a motor vehicle crash. He did not suffer any period of hypoxia but he was hypotensive (SBP = 90 mm Hg) prior to procurement. His serum liver function tests were normal prior to harvesting (AST 32 U/L, ALT 40 U/L). The organ was procured by our institution's transplant team. During procurement the liver was found to be well perfused with no focal injuries and no macroscopic evidence of steatosis.
The recipient underwent an uncomplicated conventional LT without the use of a veno-venous bypass. There were no periods of hypoxia or severe hypotension during transplantation. The cold ischemic time of the graft was 8 hours while the warm ischemic time was 45 minutes. The graft reperfused well and no biopsies were taken. Intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg) was administered intraoperatively, and postoperatively the patient received induction with Antithymocyte Globulin, which is the protocol followed at our institution. During transplantation the patient received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
At the time of LT, the international normalization ratio (INR) was 1.53, while serum total bilirubin was 103 μmol/L (Figure ). On postoperative day 2 the patient had a peak of his serum AST (3469 U/L) and at this point he had further biochemical evidence of primary graft dysfunction, with inability to normalize his INR (Figure ), and with progressive elevation of his total serum bilirubin (Figure ). Repeated ultrasonographic examination revealed a patent hepatic artery and portal vein, as well as patent hepatic veins. At this point, a liver biopsy demonstrated severe reperfusion injury with several apoptotic bodies, several dystrophic calcifications (Figure ), and no evidence of acute cellular rejection.

The patient did not have a history suggestive of hyperparathyroidism or abnormal calcium metabolism, and upon listing his serum ionized calcium was 0.94 mmol/L. The donor was a previously healthy, 52 year-old male who suffered a closed head injury during a motor vehicle crash. The organ was procured by our transplant team. Prior to procurement the donor did not suffer any periods of hypoxia or hypotension. His liver function tests were normal prior to harvesting (AST 36 U/L, ALT 45 U/L). During procurement the liver was found to be well perfused, with no evidence of aberrant vascular anatomy and no evidence of trauma. Macroscopic examination of the liver did not show any evidence of steatosis. The recipient underwent a conventional LT without venovenous bypass and without intraoperative hypotension. The cold ischemic time was 10 hours while the warm ischemic time was 40 minutes. Following reperfusion, the graft appeared well perfused and again no biopsies were taken. Intraoperatively the patient received 500 mg of methylprednisolone, and postoperatively he was induced with Antithymocyte Globulin. During transplantation the recipient received 3 units of PRBCs and 6 units of FFP. In the early postoperative period the patient had to be explored once for retroperitoneal bleeding associated with hypotension (SBP< 90 mm Hg).
At the time of LT, the patient had an INR of 2.7 and a serum total bilirubin of 104 μmol/L. Following LT, the patient developed severe primary graft dysfunction with rising serum bilirubin and INR (Figure ), while his serum ALT and AST peaked during the 2nd and 3rd postoperative day (4700 U/L and 6598 U/L respectively). At that time, ultrasonography demonstrated uniformly patent vessels (hepatic artery, portal and hepatic veins), while Computed Tomography (CT) showed areas in the right lobe of the liver isodense with the spinal column (Figure ). The patient was listed for retransplantation. During the retransplant procedure the explant liver graft had a ""bony"" consistency in the involved right lobe. Cross-sections of the right lobe showed a ""clay-like"" parenchyma with clear evidence of calcification (Figure ). Light (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation of ultrathin sections obtained from specimens selected from biopsies at the interface of calcified and non-calcified tissues showed extensive intracellular calcification within the hepatic cells (Figure ). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis demonstrated the presence of hydroxyapatite (HA) as a solid phase in the calcified region. The adjacent non- or partially calcified hepatic cells displayed extensive nuclear condensation suggestive of significant apoptosis as well as severe vacuolization, suggestive of an extensive apoptotic and necrotic process (Figure ).

He appeared ill and poorly nourished. The patient was oriented and well cooperated, and there was no previous history of hematologic or liver or another disease and recent medication. He presented with unexplained weight loss of 2 months duration along with intermittent fever, night sweats and cough. The physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 100/70 mm/Hg, pulse 100/min, a temperature 37.2°C, extensive cutaneous petechiae on lower extremities, hemorrhagic bulla on tongue and on mucosa of oral cavity, and amphoric soufflé on apex of right chest. No organomegaly or lymphadenomegaly or evidence of another disease such as chronic liver disease was detectable. The initial complete blood count revealed a white blood cell 25.1 × 109/l (58% neutrophils, 29% bants, 9% lymphocytes and 4% monocytes), hemoglobin 11.2 gr/dl, hematocrit 36%, MCV 84 fl, reticulocytes 1% and platelet count 7.6 × 109/l. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 110 mm/h. A peripheral smear was remarkable for a paucity of platelets. Coagulation profile [prothrombin time (PT), activated-partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrin degradation products (FDP)] were normal. A bone marrow aspiration demonstrated hypercellularity of all cell lines with normal maturation of myeloid and erythroid precursors. Megakaryocytes were increased in number with normal morphology. On bone marrow aspiration hemophagocytosis was not observed. A chest X-ray (Figure ) and computed tomography (CT) (Figure ) demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates and walled cavities on left and right upper lobes. Acid-fast bacilli were strongly positive in sputum (Figure ). Bone marrow aspirate and urine for acid-fast bacilli were negative. Sputum culture yielded mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The following laboratory studies were normal or negative: biochemical tests (glucose, urea, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, phosphorus, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, total protein and albumin), rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-platelet specific antibodies, Coomb's tests, HIV, hepatitis B and C virus, blood culture, bone marrow aspirate culture and abdominopelvic CT. No granuloma or hemophagocytosis was detected on bone marrow biopsy. The patient was started on rifampin 10 mg/kg/d, isoniazid 5 mg/kg/d, ethambutol 25 mg/kg/d, pyrazinamide 40 mg/kg/d, pyridoxine 75 mg/d and intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) 1 g/kg/d given for 2 days. On day 2 of hospitalization and treatment of anti-tuberculous therapy prednisolone 1 mg/kg/d was added. On day 8, platelet counts started to increase and on day 12 of the treatment it reached to 187 × 109/l level. Patient improved on day 10 and he did not have any complaints on day 14; at time of discharge. He received a total of 6 red blood cell (RBC) units throughout hospitalization. During his hospitalization findings of hemolysis or gastrointestinal bleeding and massive bleeding in another site except hematuria and hemoptysis were not established. A complete blood count at discharge demonstrated a WBC 17 × 109/l, Hb 9.6 g/dl, and platelet count 310 × 109/l (Table ). Corticosteroids were discontinued on day 14 of therapy and the patient was discharged and recurrent thrombocytopenia was not established after withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy.

There was no complaint of fever or decreased range of motion. He presented to a local orthopedist (April 1995) and was found to have a palpable abnormality on the posterior aspect of the knee consistent with a Baker's cyst. Aspiration was unsuccessful and the patient was treated with ibuprofen for a 10-day course. Nearly one year later (April 1996) the family sought a second opinion and an MR study was ordered that revealed a cystic structure [Figure ]. The patient returned to the original orthopedist and was found to have a painful and enlarging mass in the left popliteal region. He underwent resection of a solid and cystic mass (November 1996) measuring 7.0 × 6.0 × 3.0 cm. The tumor was described as a high-grade synovial cell sarcoma. The extent of resection was incomplete with gross residual tumor remaining about the lateral aspect of the knee and external to the joint capsule which also appeared to be the site of origin. The patient was transferred one month later to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.
At the time of his evaluation after referral, he had strong popliteal pulses. There was a 7.0 × 4.5 cm area of swelling and numbness in the left popliteal region. The deep-tendon reflexes were brisk and the motor exam and gait were normal. MR showed residual abnormality consistent with tumor lateral to the joint capsule. Metastatic work-up including nuclear bone scan and CT scan of the chest was negative. Tumor bed re-excision with placement of afterloading catheters was performed in December 1996. All visible residual abnormality was removed without significant disruption of underlying ligaments and tendons. The walls of the tumor bed were biopsied to map the extent of microscopic residual disease. Microscopic residual disease was anticipated given the site of involvement and the limited ability to operate beyond the extent of the abnormal appearing tissues. Eleven afterloading catheters were placed in a parallel array to cover the tumor bed [Figure ]. Radio-opaque clips were placed at the site of the biopsies and to demarcate the extent of the tumor bed for brachytherapy planning. The final pathology confirmed the presence of residual tumor in the operative specimen and microscopically involved margins at the central and superomedial aspects of the tumor bed.
Five days after surgery, the 11 catheters were loaded with a total of 135 seeds representing 408 millicuries of I125. The dwell time of the implant was 64 hours and the patient received a total implant dose of 2560 cGy delivered at 40 cGy/hr. Three weeks later, the patient began external beam irradiation at 180 cGy per day and received a total external beam dose of 4860 cGy using 6 MV photons with treatment delivered in a parallel-opposed beam arrangement using a CT based treatment plan [Figure ]. Radiation therapy was completed in February 1997.
A decision was made to initiate chemotherapy three weeks into the course of external beam irradiation based on the perceived high-risk nature of his case – longstanding history of symptoms, known residual tumor and size of tumor at presentation. Chemotherapy included vincristine, ifosfamide, and adriamycin was eventually administered for a total of four cycles. There was central dehiscence of the wound prior to the completion of radiation therapy. The wound was colonized with Enterococci sensitive to ampicillin and managed with antibiotics, whirlpool treatment and daily dressing changes. There was a one-week treatment break during the external beam portion of the treatment.
At the completion of chemotherapy (June 1997) the patient underwent excision of scar tissue with rotation flap of gastrocnemius and skin and Z-plasty of the semi-membranous and semi-tendinous tendon for a non-healing ulcer in the operative region. There was also contracture of the knee joint without signs of abscess or cellulitis. One month later, a second procedure was required to debride and irrigate the left popliteal fossa wound at the site of previously irradiated tissue and contracture release with muscle and fasciocutaneous flap closure. One year after the completion of all therapy (June 1998) the patient reported full range of motion and softening of previously fibrotic tissue. He was actively playing baseball and had no imposed limitations.
Nearly two years after completion of treatment (March 1999), the patient was noted to have Trendelenburg gait after prolonged walking ascribed to poor endurance of weakened hip abductors bilaterally. Hip hiking was also noted on the contralateral side due to leg length and ASIS height discrepancy. A difference of 2.5 cm was noted when measured from the umbilicus to the medial malleolus. He had grown 7.0 cm since the time of diagnosis. He was instructed to stretch the heel cord and strengthening his weak hip abductors. Arrangements were made to provide a shoe lift to accommodate the leg length difference. The discrepancy improved to less than 1 cm over a three month period of time (March-June 1999). He was carefully monitored for growth discrepancy and 6 months later, nearly 3 years after the initiation of treatment, the discrepancy returned to its original value of greater than 2 cm. He also had difficulty with ambulation with slight left-sided limp. Orthopedic surgery was re-consulted. The discrepancy was followed and treated with additional shoe lift. The patient continued to engage in normal activities including sports and reported full range of motion and normal strength. More than four and a half years after initiating treatment (August 2001) [Figure ], x-ray scanogram revealed estimated lengths of 49.0 cm and 46.5 cm for his right and left femora respectively, and 40.7 cm and 37.0 cm for his right and left tibiae respectively [Figure ]. There was a clinically noticeable varus deformity of the left knee. All growth plates were still open radiographically. He was taken to surgery five years after the initiation of definitive therapy (December 2001) [Figure ] for a panepiphysiodesis of the right leg. Using an image intensifier to locate the distal femoral growth plate, medial and lateral incisions were made and a wire-guided cannulated reamer was used to obliterate the plate. The same procedure was done to the proximal tibial growth plate. There were no complications from surgery and the wounds healed appropriately. He was started on physical therapy including quad sets to maintain adequate range of motion. There has been no evidence of tumor recurrence or metastatic disease nearly seven years after treatment. There are no limitations regarding activities and there has been no progressive angular growth deformities.","[[8.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['posterior aspect of the knee', 'left popliteal region',

She had experienced a fall and related all symptoms to the fall. She was seen in her local emergency room by her family physician; there was no diagnosis or treatment. Approximately one month prior to her representation, she was struck in the left knee by a basketball and developed worsening pain. She was seen by an orthopedic surgeon (December 1999) and was noted to have a valgus posture of both lower extremities, exaggerated on the left by external rotation and she walked with a mild limp. The left knee had no effusion but was hypersensitive to light touch over the lateral aspect where there was soft tissue swelling just below the knee. There was no obvious mass in the area, although firm palpation was difficult because of patient discomfort. Plain films were normal and an MR was ordered that revealed an apparent meniscal cyst in the lateral aspect of the left knee [Figure ]. Biopsy of the cystic structure was performed (November 1999) that revealed a high-grade synovial cell sarcoma. Metastatic work-up consisting of nuclear bone scan and CT of the chest were negative. Amputation was offered by the local care team that included a radiation oncologist because of their concern about possible contamination of the joint space and uncertain functional outcome. The patient was referred to St. Jude Children's Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.
At the time of her evaluation after referral (January 2000), there was a well healed scar with no excessive swelling. There was mild tenderness on the lateral aspect of her left knee. Additional imaging studies showed abnormality at the site of prior surgery equivocal for residual tumor. There was no evidence of abnormality in the joint space. The tumor bed was explored. There was no physical evidence of compromise at the level of the joint space. She underwent wide local excision with placement of afterloading catheters. Six catheters were placed in a parallel array with 1 cm spacing. Radio-opaque clips were placed to delineate the tumor bed and assist in brachytherapy planning [Figure ]. The margins of the resection were involved with tumor, as demonstrated by field biopsies and assessment of the margins of resection. Satellite tumor nodules were present in the resection specimen. Four days after surgery the six afterloading catheters were loaded with 82 seeds representing 302 mCi of I125 (Figure). The dwell time of the implant was 62 hours and the patient received a total implant dose of 2480 cGy delivered at 40 cGy/hr. Two weeks later the patient began external beam irradiation at 180 cGy/day and received a course of treatment and total external beam dose of 5040 cGy using 6 MV photons with treatment delivered with two beams using a CT based treatment plan [Figure ]. Radiation therapy was completed in March 2000.
The patient suffered moist desquamation corresponding to the radiation therapy portal that was predicted based on the treatment and the use of a tissue equivalent bolus material which was placed on the wound on alternating days during her course of external beam irradiation. She was able to return home on the last day of treatment. On routine follow-up, only 4 months after treatment, left leg appearing to be slightly longer than her right leg by less than 1 cm. No corresponding gait problems were reported. Nearly one year after treatment (January 2000) physical examination showed good range of motion at the left knee; however, there was significant valgus angulation. An MR study was reviewed by Orthopedic Surgery and was noted to show growth arrest laterally and predominantly involving the distal femoral physis [Figure ]. Based on these findings, the family was informed that an epiphysiodesis of the distal femoral physis would likely be required to prevent additional deformity. Due to the angulatory deformity, an osteotomy of the distal femur would be required. Because of high-dose irradiation and concerns about bone healing, osteotomy and epiphysiodesis were deferred until the three year evaluation was performed. At that time, the patient had a significant valgus deformity. The morbidity of the deformity was such that ambulation was difficult. The patient underwent a closing wedge correcting osteotomy, which was fixed with a contour plate. The patient subsequently fractured the plate secondary to early and unprotected weightbearing (against medical advice). She was placed in a cast and ultimately healed her osteotomy. She continues to have a significant limb length discrepancy and will require future lengthening procedures. She remains without evidence of disease nearly 4 years after treatment.","[[9.0, 'year']]",F,2004,"['left knee', 'left knee', 'both lower extremities', 'left knee', 'soft tissue', 'below the knee', 'area', 'meniscal', 'lateral aspect of the left knee', 'synovial cell', 'bone', 'chest', 'joint space', 'lateral aspect of her left knee', 'site of prior surgery', 'joint space', 'level of the joint space', 'margins of the resection', 'margins of resection', 'left leg', 'right leg', 'left knee', 'distal femoral physis', 'distal femoral physis', 'distal femur', 'bone', 'valgus', 'limb']","['pain', 'swelling', 'fall', 'fall', 'diagnosis', 'struck', 'pain', 'valgus posture of both lower extremities', 'limp', 'effusion', 'hypersensitive to light touch over the lateral aspect', 'soft tissue swelling', 'mass', 'firm palpation', 'discomfort', 'meniscal cyst', 'cystic structure', 'synovial cell sarcoma', 'contamination of the joint space', 'uncertain functional outcome', 'scar', 'swelling', 'tenderness', 'abnormality', 'tumor', 'abnormality', 'tumor bed', 'compromise', 'tumor bed', 'tumor', 'Satellite tumor nodules', 'moist desquamation', 'wound', 'left leg appearing to be slightly longer than her right leg', 'gait problems', 'good range of motion', 'valgus angulation', 'growth arrest', 'deformity', 'angulatory deformity', 'bone healing', 'valgus deformity', 'morbidity of the deformity', 'deformity', 'ambulation was difficult', 'fractured the plate', 'osteotomy', 'limb length discrepancy', 'disease']",[],"['9', 'emergency room', 'December 1999', 'November 1999', ""St. Jude Children's Hospital"", 'January 2000', 'March 2000', 'January 2000']","['treatment', 'Plain films', 'MR', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy of the cystic structure', 'Metastatic work-up', 'nuclear bone scan', 'CT of the chest', 'Amputation', 'radiation', 'treatment', 'imaging studies', 'tumor bed was explored', 'wide local excision with placement of afterloading catheters', 'Six catheters were placed in a parallel array with 1 cm spacing', 'Radio-opaque clips were placed to delineate the tumor bed', 'brachytherapy', 'field biopsies', 'surgery', 'six afterloading catheters were loaded with 82 seeds representing 302 mCi of I125', 'dwell time of the implant was 62 hours', 'total implant dose', 'external beam irradiation', 'treatment', 'total external beam dose', 'treatment', 'Radiation therapy', 'radiation therapy portal', 'treatment', 'tissue equivalent bolus material', 'external beam irradiation', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'physical examination', 'MR study', 'epiphysiodesis of the distal femoral physis', 'osteotomy of the distal femur', 'irradiation', 'osteotomy', 'epiphysiodesis', 'closing wedge correcting osteotomy', 'fixed with a contour plate', 'placed in a cast', 'osteotomy', 'lengthening procedures', 'treatment']","['one year', 'one year', 'one month', 'prior to her representation', 'November 1999', 'At the time', 'January 2000', 'Two weeks later', 'March 2000', 'last day', '4 months', 'one year', 'January 2000', 'At that time', 'nearly 4 years']"

An abdominal mass was palpated during a physical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large well-defined, near spherical mass in the left false pelvis which enhanced heterogeneously at a mean Hounsfield value of 44 units (Figure ). The mass displaced the external iliac vein medially and psoas muscle laterally. It also abutted the upper surface of the left ovary without truly invading any of these or other surrounding structures. However, the mass was believed to be in the course of the left genitofemoral nerve and lumbar plexus. The decision was made to resect the mass. Intraoperatively, the tumor's capsule was found to be densely adhered medially to the external iliac vessels, with at least 10 external venous branches directly supplying the tumor. The tumor was carefully marsupialized out of the retroperitoneal area and the decision was made to leave the residual capsule, since an attempt at its removal would have entailed a highly morbid procedure that was not felt to be justified based on the histopathologic appearance of the tumor on frozen sections. Intraoperatively, a pigmented macular lesion with faintly irregular edges was noted in the left upper thigh, which was biopsied. Pathologic examination showed a malignant melanoma with spitzoid features. The precise circumstances regarding the duration of the lesion and whether there had been any increase in its size was unclear. She subsequently underwent a wide local excision (4 × 12 cm skin ellipse was removed) and sentinel lymph node biopsy, both of which showed no residual melanoma. The patient's postoperative course over the subsequent 2 years was remarkable for a relatively slow but progressive improvements in the neurologic symptoms related to her surgery. However, she showed no evidence of either tumor recurrence at last follow-up, 26 months postoperatively.","[[35.0, 'year']]",F,2004,"['left upper leg', 'leg', 'abdominal', 'abdomen', 'pelvis', 'left false pelvis', 'external iliac vein medially', 'psoas muscle laterally', 'upper surface of the left ovary', 'left genitofemoral nerve', 'lumbar plexus', ""tumor's capsule"", 'medially to the external iliac vessels', 'external iliac vessels', 'at least 10 external venous branches', 'retroperitoneal area', 'capsule', 'macular', 'left upper thigh', 'skin', 'sentinel lymph node', 'neurologic']","['stigmata of NF-1', 'left upper leg pain', 'leg pain', 'abdominal mass', 'mass', 'mass', 'abutted', 'invading any of these or other surrounding structures', 'mass', 'mass', ""tumor's capsule"", 'tumor', 'tumor', 'residual capsule', 'tumor', 'macular lesion', 'malignant melanoma', 'spitzoid features', 'lesion', 'increase in its size', 'melanoma', 'neurologic symptoms', 'tumor recurrence']",[],"['September 2000', '35']","['physical examination', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis', 'mean Hounsfield value', 'resect the mass', 'tumor was carefully marsupialized out of the retroperitoneal area', 'leave the residual capsule', 'removal', 'morbid procedure', 'frozen sections', 'frozen sections', 'biopsied', 'Pathologic examination', 'wide local excision', 'skin ellipse was removed', 'sentinel lymph node biopsy', 'surgery']","['several months', 'several months', 'Intraoperatively', 'Intraoperatively', 'postoperative', 'over the subsequent 2 years', '26 months', 'postoperatively']"

24,522804-1,15385052,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC522804.xml,Immunohistochemical investigations and introduction of new therapeutic strategies in scleromyxoedema: Case report,"We report a 44-year-old Caucasian woman who initially presented in 2003 with a multitude of progressive lichenoid 2–4 mm papules starting two years ago, particularly marked on the forehead right above both eyebrows, on the dorsal aspects of the forearms, shoulders, legs as well as on the gluteal region, accompanied by severe pruritus (Fig. ). Clinically, the papules were judged as discrete, circumscribed, erythematous to skin-coloured, firm skin eruptions associated with an induration and stiffening of the affected lesions. Furthermore, the patient complained about a progressive thickening of the glabella. Even though we cannot ensure continuous clinical deterioration, at the time of the initiation of therapy, there was no hint for a beginning stabilisation or even improvement of symptoms. Otherwise, she felt healthy and well. The general examination was without pathological findings. Neither a topical nor a systemic therapy was yet applied.
Skin biopsies were taken from the left forearm/wrist, both legs and the left shoulder. Routine histological examination including haematoxylin-eosin, PAS labelling and Alcian blue staining revealed marked mucinous deposition within the upper and mid dermis beside an increased appearance of fibroblasts, collagen bundles and a discrete inflammatory infiltration.
Additionally, immunohistochemical investigations were performed in order to enumerate CD4+ (T helper cells), CD68+ (macrophages), anti-mastcell-tryptase+ (mastcells), decorin+ (collagen fibril stability protein), MIB-1+ (Ki-67+ proliferating cells), CD20+ (B lymphocytes), and FGF-R+ (fibroblast growth factor receptor bearing cells) cells taking consecutive sections (Table ). A punch skin biopsy measuring 3 mm in diameter was taken from affected skin of the right forearm. 5 μm paraffin-embedded sections were cut, mounted on slides and routinely preserved. Prior to the single immunolabelling, different pretreatments were performed for antigen retrieval (Table ). The alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) technique using the labelled streptavidin-biotin (LSAB) method was used to enumerate immunopositive cells at an individual dilution (Table ) taking consecutive sections. The alkaline phosphatase fast red detection kit utilised a biotinylated secondary antibody that binds to the primary antibody. This step was followed by the addition of an streptavidin enzyme conjugate binding to the biotin present on the secondary antibody. Afterwards the specific antibody-secondary-antibody-streptavidin-enzyme-complex was detected using a precipitating enzyme reaction product. Each step was incubated for a precise time and temperature. The alkaline phosphatase was used as enzyme; the chromogene fast red could be visualised. Cells were evaluated semiquantitatively (absent (-), rare (o), moderate (+), frequent (++)) directly below the dermoepidermal junction. Immunopositive cells were evaluated 'blind' separately in two view fields in a row (0.25 mm × 0.25 mm each) directly below the dermoepidermal junction resulting in a length of 0.25 mm and 0.50 mm in depth. In order to avoid a sampling error, a number of sections were randomly reevaluated by a second observer. In case of a significant difference, the sections had to be recounted by both observers. In brief, immunolabelling revealed occasional perivascular CD4+ and CD20+ lymphocytes located in the papillary dermis and a high number of anti-mastcell-tryptase+ cells within the subepithelial perivascular infiltrate revealing a continuing decrease with increasing depth (Fig. ). Simultaneously, an increased dermal expression of MIB-1+ cells (Fig. ), morphologically predominantly fibroblasts, within the upper and mid dermis and sporadic FGF-R+ cells in an unspecific distribution could be detected. CD68 immunohistochemistry and intradermal decorin levels did not alter remarkably as compared to healthy controls (data not shown). Exact results of all immunohistochemical stainings are detailed in Table .
Complete laboratory measurements unveiled the following pathological results: leucocytes 10870 μL-1, lymphocytes 13.2%, IgG 2000 mg/dl. There was no increase in B cell count. Immunoelectrophoresis disclosed albumin 51.4%, alpha-2 globuline 10.5%, gamma globuline 22.9%. Cranial x-ray, x-ray of the thorax, ultrasound of the abdominal organs, electrocardiography and urinary investigations were unremarkable. Blood smear cytological evaluation revealed beginning qualitative but still no quantitative changes as defined by leukocytic aberrations pointing towards a leftward shift. Serum immunofixation demonstrated an IgG-kappa paraproteinaemia. No elevation of the IgG-lambda paraprotein was assessed. Bone marrow biopsies displaying reactive lymphoid infiltration including minimal extension of plasma cells with monoclonal immunoglobuline production provided evidence for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) without distinct morphological characteristics of a plasmocytic plasmocytoma or plasmoblasts.
Initially, 20 MHz ultrasound scanning producing cross section images of the skin was established in order to measure both structure and thickness of the skin at the dorsal aspects of the left wrist and the right forearm. The total thickness of the skin was measured from the entrance echo to the border between the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue. A cutaneous diameter of 2291 μm at the left wrist (lesional skin) and of 1106 μm at the right forearm (non-lesional skin) could be assessed.
In our unit, an experimental treatment modality using oral MTX 12.5 mg once per week followed by a subsequent folic acid application on the following day for a 6-months-period was subsequently initiated. MTX was well tolerated by our patient. After the first three months, the continuous progress of skin lesions during the last two years could be stopped and our patient experienced subjectively an improvement and objectively a stable clinical outcome without new lesions. Subjective impression of amelioration could not be confirmed by means of ultrasound measurement. Within the following two months, no further improvement could be evaluated, whereas no further progression such as formation of new lesions or increase of stiffness could be observed. Due to the unsatisfying clinical results and declining acceptance by our patient, MTX treatment was stopped and a subsequent therapeutic attempt with medium-dose UVA1 cold-light phototherapy was initiated. Irradiation consisting of 50 J/cm2 single-dose UVA1 (CL 300000 liquid, Photomed, Hamburg, Germany) was performed four times a week for three weeks followed by two times a week for further two weeks resulting in a cumulative dose of 800 J/cm2 after five weeks. Meanwhile, the skin status again remained stable, whereas no improvement could be observed. Therefore, our patient broke up phototherapy. To date, skin condition has slightly worsened without any current treatment modality.","[[44.0, 'year']]",F,2004,"['lichenoid', 'forehead right above both eyebrows', 'dorsal aspects of the forearms', 'forearms', 'shoulders', 'legs', 'gluteal region', 'skin', 'skin', 'glabella', 'Skin', 'left forearm/wrist', 'forearm/wrist', 'both legs', 'legs', 'left shoulder', 'upper and mid dermis', 'skin', 'skin of the right forearm', 'dermoepidermal junction', 'two view fields in a row', 'dermoepidermal junction', 'perivascular', 'papillary dermis', 'subepithelial perivascular infiltrate', 'dermal', 'upper and mid dermis', 'Cranial', 'thorax', 'abdominal organs', 'Bone marrow', 'skin', 'left wrist', 'right forearm', 'skin', 'border between the dermis', 'border between the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue', 'cutaneous', 'left wrist', 'skin', 'right forearm', 'skin', 'skin', 'skin', 'skin']","['papules', 'pruritus', 'papules', 'skin eruptions', 'induration', 'stiffening of the affected lesions', 'lesions', 'thickening of the glabella', 'symptoms', 'felt healthy', 'felt healthy and well', 'pathological findings', 'mucinous deposition', 'fibroblasts', 'collagen bundles', 'discrete inflammatory infiltration', 'Immunopositive cells', 'perivascular CD4+', 'perivascular CD4+ and CD20+ lymphocytes', 'anti-mastcell-tryptase+ cells', 'dermal expression of MIB-1+ cells', 'MIB-1+ cells', 'fibroblasts', 'sporadic FGF-R+ cells', 'quantitative changes', 'leukocytic aberrations', 'leftward shift', 'IgG-kappa paraproteinaemia', 'elevation of the IgG-lambda paraprotein', 'reactive lymphoid infiltration', 'extension of plasma cells', 'monoclonal immunoglobuline production', 'monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance', 'MGUS', 'plasmocytic plasmocytoma', 'plasmoblasts', 'lesional skin', 'non-lesional skin', 'MTX was well tolerated', 'skin lesions', 'improvement', 'stable clinical outcome', 'lesions', 'improvement', 'lesions', 'stiffness', 'skin status again remained stable', 'improvement', 'skin condition']","['MTX', 'folic acid', 'MTX', 'MTX', 'UVA1', 'CL 300000']","['44', '2003', 'Germany']","['therapy', 'general examination', 'systemic therapy', 'Skin biopsies', 'histological examination', 'haematoxylin-eosin', 'PAS', 'PAS labelling', 'Alcian blue staining', 'immunohistochemical', 'CD4', 'CD4+', 'CD68', 'macrophages', 'anti-mastcell-tryptase+', 'decorin', 'collagen fibril stability protein', 'MIB-1', 'Ki-67', 'proliferating cells', 'CD20', 'B lymphocytes', 'FGF-R', 'punch skin biopsy', 'single immunolabelling', 'different pretreatments were performed for antigen retrieval', 'APAAP', 'LSAB', 'alkaline phosphatase fast red detection kit', 'primary antibody', 'streptavidin enzyme', 'secondary antibody', 'specific antibody-secondary-antibody-streptavidin-enzyme-complex', 'enzyme reaction product', 'alkaline phosphatase', 'chromogene fast red', 'immunolabelling', 'CD68 immunohistochemistry', 'intradermal decorin levels', 'immunohistochemical stainings', 'laboratory measurements', 'pathological', 'leucocytes', 'lymphocytes', 'IgG', 'B cell', 'B cell count', 'Immunoelectrophoresis', 'albumin', 'alpha-2 globuline', 'gamma globuline', 'Cranial x-ray', 'x-ray of the thorax', 'ultrasound of the abdominal organs', 'electrocardiography', 'urinary investigations', 'Blood smear cytological evaluation', 'Serum immunofixation', 'IgG-lambda paraprotein', 'Bone marrow biopsies', '20 MHz ultrasound scanning', '20 MHz ultrasound scanning producing cross section images of the skin', 'cutaneous diameter', 'ultrasound measurement', 'MTX treatment', 'therapeutic attempt', 'UVA1 cold-light phototherapy', 'Irradiation', 'phototherapy', 'treatment modality']","['two years ago', 'last two years', 'two months']"

She was a smoker, had hypertension and had a strong family history of premature ischaemic heart disease. The ECG showed widespread anterior T wave inversion. Conventional treatment was started immediately for ACS including intravenous nitrates, low molecular weight heparin, aspirin and clopidogrel. The patient remained pain-free following admission and serial biochemistry demonstrated a rise in cardiac troponin I to 24 mmol/l at 24 hours. There was no evidence of Q waves on the ECG and left ventricular function was normal on echocardiography.
Coronary angiography was undertaken four days after admission. This demonstrated mural thickening of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery with a possible filling defect at the distal end of the lesion but no evidence of coronary atherosclerosis elsewhere (Fig. ). Interrogation of the proximal LAD stenosis with IVUS (Galaxy II system; Atlantis 40 MHz Catheter, Boston Scientific/Scimed, Inc., Maple Grove, Minnesota) showed a large intracoronary thrombus (Fig. ) adherent to a mural atheromatous plaque starting at the ostium of LAD (Fig. ). The thrombus had a lobulated appearance with no evidence of internal blood flow or speckling. It contained echolucent areas indicating cavitation and consistent with ongoing thrombus organization. No evidence of complete plaque rupture (intraplaque cavity communicating with the lumen) was seen.
Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed using distal filter protection with the EZ Filterwire (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA). The GpIIb/IIIa antagonist Abciximab was administered. A 4.0 × 15 mm stent was placed directly with good final angiographic result (Fig. ) and no evidence of macroscopic distal embolisation. Repeat IVUS confirmed good apposition of the stent and the absence of residual thrombus (Fig. &). At retrieval, the Filterwire contained a small but significant amount of pink thrombotic material and yellowish plaque debris. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose (assuming a single posteroanterior projection chest x-ray is eight centi-Gray/cm2) was 380.

In 1995, she was treated with ureterolysis and ureteroureterostomy because of left-sided ureteral obstruction. Histological evaluation of the biopsy revealed benign fibrous tissue proliferations; however, no further evaluation and surgical excision was planned as her mental state was deteriorating. She was put on regular follow-up with computed tomography (CT) scans. In May 2002, she was referred from the psychiatric hospital to our Department of Urology, as the tumor tended to grow. CT scan with contrast enhancement revealed a tumor located between iliocostalis and psoas muscles in retroperitoneal space. The peripheral part of the tumor was enhanced, while the central part did not. The left paravertebral muscles around the tumor showed atrophy. The medial margin of the tumor was deformed by a left transverse process of the second lumber spine, suggesting invasive behavior (Figure ). Coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the tumor to be located beneath the left kidney. The central part of the tumor was found to be of iso/low intensity in the T1-weighted phase and of heterogeneously high intensity in the T2-weighted phase. The marginal part showed very low intensity in both phases (Figure ). In May 2002, needle biopsy was performed and revealed that the tumor consisted of well-proliferated spindle cells rich in collagen fibers, an observation that was inconsistent with the histological pictures made in 1995. In June 2002, resection was performed using a paraspinal approach. Although the tumor strongly adhered to adjacent tissues, including the urinary tract and peritoneum, it was marginally resected, including paravertebral muscles and part of the spine. As the kidney was less affected by the tumor, ablation posed no problem. On gross examination, the cut surface appeared homogeneously gray and glossy (Figure ). Histologically, a uniform proliferation of spindle cells with a moderate amount of collagen fibers led to a diagnosis of extraabdominal fibromatosis in the retroperitoneal space (Figure ). No adjuvant treatment was given and during the two years of follow-up, the patient has remained asymptomatic, with no restrictions of daily living. There were no clues as to recurrence of the tumor in computed tomography.","[[43.0, 'year']]",F,2004,"['left flank', 'back', 'left-sided ureteral', 'fibrous tissue', 'mental state', 'between iliocostalis and psoas muscles in retroperitoneal space', 'iliocostalis', 'psoas muscles', 'retroperitoneal space', 'left paravertebral muscles around the tumor', 'left transverse process of the second lumber spine', 'beneath the left kidney', 'marginal part', 'paraspinal', 'adjacent tissues', 'urinary tract', 'peritoneum', 'paravertebral muscles', 'part of the spine', 'kidney', 'spindle cells', 'extraabdominal', 'retroperitoneal space']","['schizophrenia', 'pain', 'left-sided ureteral obstruction', 'fibrous tissue proliferations', 'mental state was deteriorating', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'atrophy', 'medial margin of the tumor', 'invasive behavior', 'tumor', 'central part of the tumor', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'problem', 'cut surface appeared homogeneously gray and glossy', 'proliferation of spindle cells', 'collagen fibers', 'extraabdominal fibromatosis', 'asymptomatic', 'restrictions of daily living', 'tumor']",[],"['43', '1982', '23', '1995', 'May 2002', 'May 2002', '1995', 'June 2002']","['ureterolysis', 'ureteroureterostomy', 'biopsy', 'surgical excision', 'computed tomography (CT) scans', 'CT scan with contrast enhancement', 'Coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'needle biopsy', 'histological pictures', 'resection was performed using a paraspinal approach', 'marginally resected', 'ablation', 'gross examination', 'Histologically', 'adjuvant treatment', 'computed tomography']","['since 1982', 'In 1995', 'In 1995', '1995', 'June 2002']"
28,524360-1,15473910,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC524360.xml,Cerebral relapse of metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor during treatment with imatinib mesylate: Case report,"A 47-year-old man presented in July 1999 with melena. A small bowel series and CT abdomen showed a jejunal mass and a 5 × 5 cm complex hepatic mass. A biopsy of the liver lesion revealed a spindle cell tumor. Laparotomy was performed, and the 7.5 cm jejunal mass was resected. A total of 4 liver lesions were noted, but not resected. The histopathology confirmed a gastrointestinal stromal tumor with clear resection margins. He subsequently had 4 cycles of attempted cytoreductive chemotherapy using doxorubicin and dacarbazine. A repeat CT scan showed progression of the liver metastases. An extended right hemihepatectomy was performed in December 1999 with successful excision of all 4 liver metastases.
The patient remained well until review in August 2001 when he complained of lethargy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, diplopia and blurred vision in the left eye. Examination revealed weakness of the right lateral rectus ocular muscle, an amelanotic left choroidal lesion, hepatomegaly and a subcutaneous nodule in the gluteal region. An enhancing lesion in the infero-lateral region of the right globe was confirmed on CT which was thought to be the cause of the ocular muscle weakness. The CT scan also demonstrated a recurrence of multiple hepatic metastases. There were no intracerebral lesions. The gluteal lesion was biopsied and confirmed recurrence of GIST (CD117 positive). A positron emission tomogram (PET) scan also confirmed disease recurrence in the same distribution. Lumbar puncture and MRI scan of the brain excluded the presence of leptomeningeal or cerebral metastases. The patient was commenced on imatinib mesylate (STI-571, Gleevec, Novartis) 400 mg bd in September 2001 as part of a clinical trial. He felt much improved by November 2001 when a repeat CT abdomen showed stable disease but PET scan now showed no FDG uptake. By January 2002 his diplopia had completely resolved but the left-sided choroidal lesion remained unchanged on fundoscopy. The buttock lesion had also resolved.
A progress CT in December 2002 showed minor enlargement of one of the liver lesions. A PET scan however continued to show no areas of abnormal FDG uptake. The patient at that time had developed a right-sided foot drop. MRI of the brain and spine demonstrated a left parasagittal tumor with radiographic features consistent with a meningioma (see Figure ). Imatinib was ceased preoperatively as per the trial protocol. A craniotomy was performed on the 28th January 2003 with complete resection of the lesion. Histopathology demonstrated metastatic GIST (CD117 positive) (see Figures and ). Post operatively the patient developed recurrent diplopia (due to recurrent right lateral rectus weakness) with blurred vision off imatinib. This was recommenced at a dose of 400 mg bd on the 14th February 2003 after being ceased 6 weeks earlier because of the documented disease progression in the brain as required by the trial protocol. Drug supply was obtained through a compassionate use program. Repeat fundoscopy in February 2003 showed the choroidal lesion had enlarged. His foot drop persisted, however his diplopia again had completely resolved by March 2003.
Mutational analysis on the tumor blocks was carried out. An in-frame GCCTAT insertion/duplication in exon 9 of c-kit in the original jejunal tumor, the liver and the cerebral metastases were detected (See Figure ). No mutations were found in exons 11, 13 or 17 in any of the samples.
Due to limited drug supply available on compassionate use (pending local approval for reimbursement), the patient's dose of imatinib mesylate was reduced to 400 mg per day in March 2003. Six weeks later, his diplopia had returned and a progress CT abdomen demonstrated a minor progression of the liver lesions. His liver function tests remained normal. A subsequent PET scan again showed no abnormal uptake despite disease progression on the CT scan. His dose of imatinib mesylate was increased initially to 600 mg per day with resolution of the diplopia.
By May 2003 his foot drop had worsened and his dose of imatinib mesylate was increased back to 800 mg per day. Despite the increase in dose, his foot drop worsened. A repeat CT brain demonstrated a recurrence of the cerebral metastasis with surrounding vasogenic oedema in the previous site of resection. A repeat abdominal CT showed no significant change in the size of the liver metastasis and mild shrinking of the nodule in the buttock.
Due to limited treatment options available for the cerebral metastasis, a re-resection of the cranial metastasis was offered. A repeat MRI of the brain in late July 2003 confirmed the presence of the left parasagittal lesion with surrounding edema but no mass effect. Repeat craniotomy and incomplete debulking of the parasagittal metastasis was performed on the 9th September 2003. A small residual area of tumor was seen on the postoperative scan. Abdominal imaging two months later showed that two of the liver lesions had increased in size with the other areas stable. He was not a candidate for further hepatic resection as there was insufficient liver reserve due to the past surgery. Radiofrequency ablation was declined as the patient did not have symptoms referable to the area.
The patient remained well until December 2003 when he experienced symptoms of headaches, worsening diplopia, right foot drop and left arm weakness. MRI scan confirmed recurrence of the cerebral metastasis with extension across the falx cerebri. He declined cranial radiotherapy treatment at the time and instead underwent a third resection of the lesion in January 2004 where incomplete debulking was achieved with early improvement of his limb weakness. In April 2004 the patient enrolled into a randomised placebo controlled clinical trial of a novel multi-kinase inhibitor SU-11248 (Pfizer) for the treatment of imatinib refractory GIST. However his condition slowly deteriorated and he died in July 2004.","[[47.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['small bowel', 'abdomen', 'jejunal', 'hepatic', 'liver', 'spindle cell', 'jejunal', 'liver', 'gastrointestinal stromal', 'liver', 'liver', 'right upper quadrant abdominal', 'left eye', 'right lateral rectus ocular muscle', 'left choroidal', 'gluteal region', 'infero-lateral region of the right globe', 'ocular muscle', 'hepatic', 'intracerebral', 'gluteal', 'Lumbar', 'brain', 'leptomeningeal', 'cerebral', 'abdomen', 'left-sided choroidal', 'buttock', 'liver', 'right-sided foot', 'brain', 'spine', 'left parasagittal', 'right lateral rectus', 'brain', 'choroidal', 'foot', 'jejunal', 'liver', 'cerebral', 'exons 11, 13 or 17', 'abdomen', 'liver', 'liver', 'foot', 'foot', 'brain', 'cerebral', 'previous site of resection', 'abdominal', 'liver', 'buttock', 'cerebral', 'cranial', 'brain', 'left parasagittal', 'parasagittal', 'Abdominal', 'liver', 'hepatic', 'liver', 'right foot', 'left arm', 'cerebral', 'falx cerebri', 'cranial', 'limb']","['melena', 'jejunal mass', 'hepatic mass', 'liver lesion', 'spindle cell tumor', 'jejunal mass', 'liver lesions', 'gastrointestinal stromal tumor', 'clear resection margins', 'liver metastases', 'liver metastases', 'remained well', 'lethargy', 'right upper quadrant abdominal pain', 'diplopia', 'blurred vision', 'weakness of the right lateral rectus ocular muscle', 'amelanotic left choroidal lesion', 'hepatomegaly', 'subcutaneous nodule', 'enhancing lesion', 'lesion', 'ocular muscle weakness', 'hepatic metastases', 'intracerebral lesions', 'gluteal lesion', 'GIST', 'disease', 'metastases', 'felt much improved', 'stable disease', 'FDG uptake', 'diplopia', 'left-sided choroidal lesion', 'buttock lesion', 'enlargement of one of the liver lesions', 'areas of abnormal FDG uptake', 'right-sided foot drop', 'left parasagittal tumor', 'radiographic features', 'meningioma', 'lesion', 'metastatic GIST', 'diplopia', 'right lateral rectus weakness', 'blurred vision', 'disease', 'choroidal lesion', 'lesion', 'foot drop', 'diplopia', 'tumor blocks', 'jejunal tumor', 'metastases', 'mutations', 'diplopia', 'liver lesions', 'abnormal', 'abnormal uptake', 'disease', 'diplopia', 'foot drop', 'foot drop', 'cerebral metastasis', 'vasogenic oedema', 'change in the size of the liver metastasis', 'shrinking of the nodule', 'cerebral metastasis', 'cranial metastasis', 'left parasagittal lesion', 'surrounding edema', 'mass effect', 'parasagittal metastasis', 'residual area of tumor', 'tumor', 'liver lesions', 'insufficient liver reserve', 'symptoms', 'remained well', 'headaches', 'diplopia', 'right foot drop', 'left arm weakness', 'cerebral metastasis', 'lesion', 'limb weakness', 'GIST', 'condition slowly deteriorated', 'deteriorated', 'died']","['doxorubicin', 'dacarbazine', 'imatinib mesylate', 'Gleevec', 'Novartis', 'Imatinib', 'imatinib', 'imatinib mesylate', 'imatinib mesylate', 'imatinib mesylate', 'imatinib']","['47', 'July 1999', 'December 1999', 'August 2001', 'September 2001', 'November 2001', 'January 2002', 'December 2002', '28th January 2003', '14th February 2003', 'February 2003', 'March 2003', 'March 2003', 'May 2003', 'July 2003', '9th September 2003', 'December 2003', 'January 2004', 'April 2004', 'July 2004']","['small bowel series', 'CT abdomen', 'biopsy of the liver lesion', 'Laparotomy', 'jejunal mass was resected', 'resected', 'histopathology', 'cytoreductive chemotherapy', 'CT scan', 'extended right hemihepatectomy', 'excision of all 4 liver metastases', 'CT', 'CT scan', 'biopsied', 'CD117', 'positron emission tomogram (PET) scan', 'Lumbar puncture', 'MRI scan of the brain', 'CT abdomen', 'PET scan', 'fundoscopy', 'CT', 'PET scan', 'MRI of the brain and spine', 'craniotomy', 'complete resection of the lesion', 'Histopathology', 'CD117', 'fundoscopy', 'Mutational analysis', 'in-frame GCCTAT insertion/duplication in exon 9 of c-kit', 'CT abdomen', 'liver function tests', 'PET scan', 'CT scan', 'CT brain', 'abdominal CT', 're-resection of the cranial metastasis', 'MRI of the brain', 'craniotomy', 'incomplete debulking of the parasagittal metastasis', 'scan', 'Abdominal imaging', 'hepatic resection', 'surgery', 'Radiofrequency ablation', 'MRI', 'MRI scan', 'cranial radiotherapy treatment', 'third resection of the lesion', 'incomplete debulking', 'novel multi-kinase inhibitor SU-11248', 'Pfizer']","['July 1999', 'December 1999', 'August 2001', 'September 2001', 'September 2001', 'September 2001', 'November 2001', 'January 2002', 'December 2002', 'at that time', 'preoperatively', '28th January 2003', 'Post operatively', 'Post operatively', '14th February 2003', 'February 2003', 'March 2003', 'March 2003', 'Six weeks later', 'late July 2003', '9th September 2003', '9th September 2003', 'postoperative', 'two months later', 'December 2003', 'at the time', 'January 2004', 'July 2004']"
29,524488-1,15491502,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC524488.xml,Effect of splenectomy on type-1/type-2 cytokine gene expression in a patient with adult idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP),"A 42 year old woman presented in October 1999 in Patras University Hospital (PUH) with lower limb purpura and low platelet count (7 × 106/L). Following clinical exclusion of causes of secondary thrombocytopenia [] the diagnosis of ITP was reached.
The patient initially received glucocorticoid treatment to which she showed a temporary response until 6 months later when she relapsed. She was subsequently started on danazol without any clinical benefit. Intravenous immune globulin administration also proved ineffective after two 5-day cycles. As a result, the patient was subjected to splenectomy 9 months after the diagnosis with complete response, attaining platelet counts over 150 × 106/L within 10 days after the operation. Five years later, she remains in clinical remission.
Two consecutive blood samples were obtained from the patient, 3 and 7 months after splenectomy for the purposes of this study. A control group consisted of 11 adult healthy volunteers (6 women and 5 men, median age 40 years, range 18–65 years). Informed consent was obtained from the patient. PUH abides by the Helsinki declaration on ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared from each blood sample by centrifugation over a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Pharmacia, Sweden). The cells were cultured in vitro for 8 h with the addition of 20 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 1 μM ionomycin (Sigma, St-Louis, MI).
Total cellular RNA extracted from 106 cells was submitted to semiquantitative RT-PCR for the amplification of IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 metagraphs []. Primers and conditions for the RT-PCR are summarized in Table . The PCR products were run on ethidium-stained agarose gels, photographed and quantified [].
A sharp decrease in the expression of the type-1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ and their calculated sum expressing Th1 activity was observed at 7 months after splenectomy compared to 3 months after splenectomy (Figure ); this was accompanied by a parallel rise of platelet count from 190 × 106/L to 265 × 106/L. Regarding type-2 cytokine gene expression, IL-4 increased, IL-5 decreased, and IL-10 remained unchanged, whereas the change in Th2 activity (IL-4 units plus IL-5 units) was slight (Figure ). The Th1/Th2 ratio {(IL-2+IFNγ)/(IL-4+IL-5)}, that reflects immune deviation, was accordingly greatly reduced 7 months post-splenectomy (Th1/Th2 = 1.3) compared to 3 months (Th1/Th2 = 3.5) (Figure ). Mean Th1/Th2 ratio of the controls was 0.5 with 95% confidence intervals of the mean (0.15–0.85). The Th1/Th2 values at 3 months and at 7 months post-splenectomy lie at 6.25 and 1.6 standard deviations above the mean of the controls, respectively.
The above results show that in this patient type-1 polarization persists after removal of the spleen and attainment of clinical remission. This may mean that the spleen is not exclusively responsible for the coordination or the maintenance of the pathological immune response in this patient, provided that no accessory splenic tissue exists. Other disease centres may control the autoimmune reaction as well, such as the liver or the bone marrow. Alternatively, it is possible that ITP is the manifestation of a general immune system malfunction that pre-existed before the development of thrombocytopenia and persists after removal of what seems to be the effector of a manifestation of an autoimmune proclivity.
Unfortunately, a pre-splenectomy sample was not available for analysis. As a result, no conclusions can be drawn about the effect of splenectomy on the direction of change of Th1 activity. Based on phenotypic studies showing increased presence of T lymphocytes with activated phenotype after splenectomy in ITP patients [], it is plausible that peripheral Th1 activity may have increased after splenectomy.
The clinical remission may be due to the removal of a major platelet destruction site, although the underlying immune activity that drives the destruction may remain unaffected. Complete remission does not mean that increased platelet destruction has stopped after splenectomy. Platelet life span may still be shortened in this patient and/or her normal platelet count may be even higher than what was achieved after splenectomy.
The pathological immune activity seems to decrease over time after splenectomy, as reflected by the lower Th1/Th2 ratio that is indicative of the degree of immune polarization. This may be explained by reduced stimulation of the immune system by activated spleen reticuloendothelial cells that present platelet antigens to T helper lymphocytes. In this way, it may be hypothesized that removal of one vital component of the self-attacking immune process can break the vicious circle that culminates in even greater immune activation, polarization, and platelet destruction. Removal of a major site of autoimmune activity may have abrogated recruitment of naïve T-cells. As a result, overall autoimmune activity wears off, as existing activated Th1 effector cells perish leaving behind a much smaller population of peripheral memory cells that retain the initial Th phenotype.
Another consideration that stems from the results of this case study is that immune polarization and immune deviation of the pathological response depend more on upregulation of type-1 mediators rather than on suppression of type-2 cytokines, or that type-2 response is inadequate to control excess type-1 response in active disease.","[[42.0, 'year']]",F,2004,"['lower limb', 'spleen', 'spleen', 'accessory splenic tissue', 'liver', 'bone', 'bone marrow', 'immune system', 'major platelet destruction site', 'immune system', 'spleen', 'major site of autoimmune activity']","['lower limb purpura', 'low platelet count', 'thrombocytopenia', 'ITP', 'clinical remission', 'type-1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-', 'Th1 activity', 'type-2 cytokine gene expression', 'cytokine gene expression', 'change in Th2 activity', 'immune deviation', 'polarization', 'ITP', 'immune system malfunction', 'thrombocytopenia', 'autoimmune proclivity', 'direction of change of Th1 activity', 'presence of T lymphocytes', 'T lymphocytes', 'activated phenotype', 'ITP', 'peripheral Th1 activity', 'immune activity', 'immune activity that drives the destruction may remain unaffected', 'Complete remission', 'platelet destruction', 'Platelet life span may still be shortened', 'normal platelet count', 'pathological immune activity', 'lower Th1/Th2 ratio', 'degree of immune polarization', 'reduced stimulation of the immune system', 'activated spleen reticuloendothelial cells', 'platelet antigens to T helper lymphocytes', 'removal of one vital component of the self-attacking immune process', 'break the vicious circle', 'greater immune activation', 'immune activation', 'polarization', 'platelet destruction', 'Removal of a major site of autoimmune activity', 'overall autoimmune activity wears off', 'activated Th1 effector cells perish', 'peripheral memory cells', 'initial Th phenotype', 'immune polarization', 'immune deviation of the pathological response', 'upregulation of type-1 mediators', 'suppression']","['danazol', 'phorbol myristate acetate', 'ionomycin']","['42', 'October 1999', 'Patras University Hospital', 'Helsinki', 'Pharmacia, Sweden', 'Louis']","['platelet count', 'glucocorticoid treatment', 'immune globulin', 'splenectomy', 'platelet counts', 'blood samples', 'splenectomy', 'cells were cultured in vitro', 'Total cellular RNA extracted from 106 cells', 'semiquantitative RT-PCR', 'RT-PCR', 'PCR', 'splenectomy', 'splenectomy', 'platelet count', 'IL-4', 'IL-5', 'IL-10', 'Th1/Th2 ratio', 'IL-4+IL-5', 'Th1/Th2', 'Th1/Th2', 'Mean Th1/Th2 ratio of the controls', 'Th1/Th2', 'removal of the spleen', 'removal', 'analysis', 'splenectomy', 'phenotypic studies', 'splenectomy', 'splenectomy', 'removal of a major platelet destruction site', 'splenectomy', 'platelet count', 'splenectomy', 'splenectomy', 'Th1/Th2 ratio']","['9 months', 'Five years later', '3 and 7 months', '8 h', '7 months', '7 months', 'post-splenectomy', '3 months', '3 months', '7 months', 'post-splenectomy']"

She was initially diagnosed as suffering from viral gastroenteritis. However, the vomiting had persisted and had become associated with a mild frontal headache. She had an unremarkable past medical history and was not taking any regular medication. She had never smoked and there was no recent antecedent foreign travel.
On examination she appeared clinically dehydrated but otherwise looked well, and was alert and orientated. She was apyrexial and had no rash, photophobia, neck stiffness or stigmata of endocarditis. She had a sinus tachycardia of 104/minute, with normal heart sounds, and a blood pressure of 130/76 mmHg. Chest, abdominal and neurological examinations were unremarkable. She had a plasma sodium of 127 mmol/L (135–145 mmol/L), potassium of 3.4 mmol/L (3.5–5.0 mmol/l), urea 4.8 mmol/L (3.0–6.5 mmol/L) and creatinine of 68 mmol/L (60–125 mmol/L). There was no biochemical evidence of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) production (serum osmolality 261 mmols/kg; urine osmolality 71 mmols/Kg; urine sodium < 10 mmol/L). Serum complement and plasma immunoglobulin levels were unremarkable with no evidence of immunosuppression. In addition, she had a normal full autoimmune profile and thyroid function. Random cortisol level was mildly elevated at 799 nmol/L (normal 140 – 700 nmol/L) consistent with a stress response.
Her initial white cell count (WCC) was mildly elevated at 13.0 × 109/L (normal 4–11 × 109/L) with a neutrophilia of 10 × 109/L (normal 2–7.5 × 109/L). Her ECG and chest X-ray were normal. Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was slightly elevated at 10 mg/L (normal <5 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was normal at 5 mm/hour. Her Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were normal. Initial microbiological investigations (blood cultures, urine microscopy and culture) were normal.
Initial management consisted of slow intravenous rehydration with normal saline and antiemetic therapy, which led to a mild symptomatic improvement. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed mild oesophagitis.
During the ensuing two weeks her laboratory investigations remained stable (CRP normal; ESR normal; sodium 127–131 mmol/L; WCC 11–13 × 109/L). However, on day 4 of admission she developed a low-grade pyrexia of 37.5°C, which persisted (<38°C). A CT scan of the head revealed periventricular patchy white matter changes but no features of raised intracranial pressure or space occupying lesion.
Unfortunately the patient had become slowly more lethargic, withdrawn, and depressed. By day 17 of admission, although alert, she was uncooperative with intermittent confusion. Her symptoms of intermittent nausea and vomiting with occasional frontal headache continued.
On day 18 she underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) as she still had a low-grade pyrexia (temperature 37.5°C) and neutrophilia of 9.3 × 109/L). In addition, her nausea and vomiting had failed to fully settle with supportive treatment. The LP results were as follows: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appearance was pale yellow and clear; protein = 5.69 g/L (0.15–0.4 g/L); CSF glucose 1.7 mmol/L versus plasma glucose 5.7 mmol/L (ratio = 30%, normal > 50%); CSF WCC = 106/mL (normal <5 WCC/mL) – 99% lymphocytes. Gram's stain revealed gram-negative coccobacilli; acid-fast bacilli were not seen. She was commenced on intravenous ceftriaxone.
Contrast MRI brain revealed sub-acute infarction of the right frontal cortex but with no evidence of meningeal enhancement. EEG demonstrated slow wave activity, which was consistent with a meningo-encephalitis.
Within 48 hours of intravenous antibiotics she was more alert, orientated, and sitting out of bed. CSF culture grew gram-negative cocci, which was identified as Neisseria meningitidis group B, type NT, subtype NT P1.16/nt. She underwent contact tracing and completed a 10-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone. She continued to make a slow but progressive recovery. After a period of rehabilitation and intense physiotherapy she was discharged home 40 days after admission, with mild residual gait ataxia.","[[62.0, 'year']]",F,2004,"['frontal', 'neck', 'heart', 'Chest', 'abdominal', 'neurological', 'thyroid', 'chest', 'Chest', 'Upper gastrointestinal', 'head', 'periventricular', 'white matter', 'intracranial', 'frontal', 'lumbar', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'CSF', 'brain', 'right frontal cortex', 'meningeal']","['vomiting', 'malaise', 'hyponatraemia', 'viral gastroenteritis', 'vomiting', 'frontal headache', 'unremarkable', 'dehydrated', 'looked well', 'alert', 'orientated', 'apyrexial', 'rash', 'photophobia', 'neck stiffness', 'stigmata of endocarditis', 'sinus tachycardia', 'normal heart sounds', 'unremarkable', 'syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) production', 'immunosuppression', 'stress response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'oesophagitis', 'pyrexia', 'periventricular patchy white matter changes', 'raised intracranial pressure', 'space occupying lesion', 'lethargic', 'withdrawn', 'depressed', 'alert', 'uncooperative', 'confusion', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'frontal headache', 'pyrexia', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'pale yellow', 'clear', 'gram-negative coccobacilli', 'acid-fast bacilli', 'infarction of the right frontal cortex', 'meningeal enhancement', 'slow wave activity', 'meningo-encephalitis', 'alert', 'orientated', 'sitting out of bed', 'gram-negative cocci', 'Neisseria meningitidis group B', 'type NT', 'subtype NT P1.16/nt', 'recovery', 'gait ataxia']","['normal saline', 'ceftriaxone', 'ceftriaxone']","['62', 'retired']","['medication', 'blood pressure', 'plasma sodium', 'potassium', 'urea', 'creatinine', 'serum osmolality', 'urine osmolality', 'urine sodium', 'Serum complement', 'plasma', 'plasma immunoglobulin levels', 'full autoimmune profile', 'thyroid function', 'Random cortisol level', 'white cell count', 'WCC', 'neutrophilia', 'ECG', 'chest X-ray', 'C-reactive protein', 'CRP', 'erythrocyte sedimentation rate', 'ESR', 'Chest X-ray', 'electrocardiogram', 'microbiological', 'blood cultures', 'urine microscopy', 'culture', 'rehydration', 'antiemetic therapy', 'Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy', 'laboratory', 'CRP', 'ESR', 'sodium', 'WCC', 'CT scan of the head', 'lumbar puncture', 'lumbar puncture (LP)', 'LP', 'temperature', 'neutrophilia', 'supportive treatment', 'LP', 'protein', 'CSF glucose', 'plasma glucose', 'CSF WCC', 'lymphocytes', ""Gram's stain"", 'Contrast MRI brain', 'EEG', 'antibiotics', 'CSF', 'CSF culture', 'contact tracing', 'rehabilitation', 'physiotherapy']","['four-week', 'four-week', 'four-week', 'ensuing two weeks', 'day 4 of admission', 'On day 18', '48 hours']"

The electrophysiological study was performed off therapy using three diagnostic catheters (one decapolar and two quadripolars) which have been positioned in the coronary sinus (CS1 → CS5 = distal → proximal coronary sinus), His bundle region, and high right atrium/right ventricular apex. The clinical arrhythmia was diagnosed as an orthodromic atrio-ventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT) due to a LSAP that was repetitively induced by both right atrial and ventricular programmed electrical stimulation. The length of the tachycardia cycle ranged from 310 to 300 msec. A well-localized accessory pathway insertion was detected in the lateral left free wall with atrial-ventricular (AV) and ventricular-atrial (VA) intervals of fusion noticeable only in CS2 (Fig ). During programmed atrial stimulation and AVRT, the transaortic approach was initially attempted by using a 7F-4 mm bidirectional ablation catheter (Blazer HTD, Boston Scientific). Although very short VA and AV intervals (<50 msec without isoelectric line between the two potentials) and satisfactory mean temperature (54–56 C° for 20–30 sec with less than 30 Watts for each radiofrequency application) were obtained, repeated radiofrequency erogations resulted in a transient interruption of the anomalous connection, with recurrence of retrograde conduction along the accessory pathway and atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia inducibility after a period of 20–30 min. Therefore, by using a mechanical single element ultrasound 9F-9 MHz catheter, an ICE-guided transseptal approach was attempted in order to cranially map the mitral ring (Ultra ICE Boston Scientific/CVIS San José, CA USA). This approach has provided a 360° two-dimensional imaging on a transverse plane perpendicular to the transducer with a radial field of view of approximately 5 cm in depth. ICE catheter was introduced via femoral vein through a 10F long sheath and advanced into the high right atrium. Careful handling of the catheter, along the interatrial septum, provided optimal view of the fossa ovalis that could be easily recognized as a thin area compared to the surrounding atrial structures. The standard approach to transseptal catheterization using a long sheath and dilator over a Brockenbrough needle, was used []. The tip of the needle-dilator-sheath apparatus was positioned facing the middle portion of the fossa ovalis. Careful up and down movements of ICE catheter allowed a clear visualization of the needle as well as its contact with the septal wall causing the typical ""tenting"" effect (Fig ), which allowed precise location of the puncture of the needle.
Accessory pathway was completely and definitively ablated with this approach after two erogations lasting each 40 sec. Although the AV and VA intervals that had been selected to deliver radiofrequency energy were similar to those previously recorded, the only difference was a better AV ratio (Fig ). Such findings might be related to the cranial approach of the atrioventricular ring which has allowed a more stable catheter position on endocardium surface and a lack of lateral sliding, resulting in a higher mean temperature (60° ± 3° vs 54° ± 2°). Radiation exposure was shorter with the transseptal approach (11 vs 19 min) when compared to the retrograde approach.","[[24.0, 'year']]",F,2004,"['supraventricular', 'coronary sinus', 'bundle region', 'right atrium', 'right ventricular apex', 'atrio-ventricular', 'right atrial', 'ventricular', 'accessory pathway', 'lateral left free wall', 'atrial-ventricular (AV)', 'ventricular-atrial (VA)', 'CS2', 'atrial', 'transaortic', 'VA', 'AV', 'accessory pathway', 'atrioventricular', 'mitral ring', 'femoral vein', 'right atrium', 'interatrial septum', 'fossa ovalis', 'atrial structures', 'transseptal', 'middle portion of the fossa ovalis', 'septal wall', 'Accessory pathway', 'AV', 'VA', 'AV', 'cranial', 'atrioventricular ring', 'endocardium surface']","['Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome', 'supraventricular tachycardia', 'high right atrium', 'clinical arrhythmia', 'arrhythmia', 'orthodromic atrio-ventricular re-entrant tachycardia', 'AVRT', 'LSAP', 'tachycardia', 'well-localized accessory pathway insertion', 'intervals of fusion', 'VA and AV intervals', 'transient interruption of the anomalous connection', 'retrograde conduction along the accessory pathway', 'atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia inducibility', 'better AV ratio', 'cranial approach of the atrioventricular ring', 'stable catheter position on endocardium surface', 'lack of lateral sliding', 'higher mean temperature', 'Radiation exposure was shorter']",[],['24'],"['medical therapy', 'TCRFA procedure', 'electrophysiological study', 'therapy', 'atrial stimulation', 'AVRT', 'transaortic approach was initially attempted by using a 7F-4 mm bidirectional ablation catheter (Blazer HTD, Boston Scientific)', 'mean temperature', 'mechanical single element ultrasound 9F-9 MHz catheter, an ICE-guided transseptal approach was attempted in order to cranially map the mitral ring', '360° two-dimensional imaging on a transverse plane perpendicular to the transducer with a radial field of view of approximately 5 cm in depth', 'ICE catheter was introduced via femoral vein through a 10F long sheath and advanced into the high right atrium', 'transseptal catheterization using a long sheath and dilator over a Brockenbrough needle', 'tip of the needle-dilator-sheath apparatus was positioned facing the middle portion of the fossa ovalis', 'Accessory pathway was completely and definitively ablated', 'Accessory pathway was completely and definitively ablated with this approach after two erogations lasting each 40 sec', 'erogations', 'mean temperature']",[]

An atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia, due to an overt LSAP, was repetitively induced by atrial and ventricular programmed electrical stimulation. The length of the tachycardia cycle ranged from 340 to 320 msec. The accessory pathway insertion resulted well-localized in the left lateral mitral ring during AVRT and atrial pacing with maximal pre-excitation (Fig ). The trans-aortic approach was firstly attempted by using a 7F- 4 mm bidirectional ablation catheter (Blazer HTD, Boston Scientific). Despite an optimal catheter tip temperature for a reasonable period of time (five erogations reaching a mean temperature of 55° lasting 30–40 sec), only a temporary interruption of the anomalous pathway conduction was obtained. Therefore, ICE-guided transseptal approach was performed as previously described (see ). The approach resulted in a persistent and complete ablation of the accessory pathway after two successful radiofrequency erogations which have been delivered when the VA interval resulted fused and its ratio was 1,5:1. In this case, ICE allowed a more complete mapping of the mitral ring and a confirmation of effective catheter ablation tip contact. As in the previously described case, the superior approach to the left AV ring resulted in a better manipulation of the ablation catheter in addition to a reduction in fluoroscopic time (10 vs 21 min).","[[61.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['supraventricular', 'atrioventricular', 'atrial', 'ventricular', 'left lateral mitral ring', 'atrial', 'trans-aortic', 'anomalous pathway', 'accessory pathway', 'mitral ring', 'left AV ring']","['supraventricular tachycardia', 'atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia', 'LSAP', 'tachycardia cycle', 'well-localized', 'pre-excitation', 'optimal catheter tip temperature', 'interruption of the anomalous pathway', 'interruption of the anomalous pathway conduction', 'complete ablation of the accessory pathway', 'VA interval resulted fused', 'effective catheter ablation tip contact', 'better manipulation of the ablation catheter']",[],['61'],"['TCRFA procedure', 'antiarrhytmic drugs', 'electrophysiological study', 'length of the tachycardia cycle', 'accessory pathway insertion', 'AVRT', 'atrial pacing', 'trans-aortic approach was firstly attempted by using a 7F- 4 mm bidirectional ablation catheter (Blazer HTD, Boston Scientific)', 'mean temperature', 'complete ablation of the accessory pathway', 'radiofrequency erogations', 'ICE']",['lasting 30–40 sec']

Additional symptoms included recent onset hematuria, and low-grade fevers to 100.4 C over the prior four days. He had also sustained a 25 lb weight loss in the last six months, indicating a lack of disease control.
As an outpatient, his maintenance therapy included mesalamine (1 gram three times a day), and mercaptopurine (75 mg once per day). In addition, he had been started on prednisone approximately 7 weeks prior for treatment of an ulcerative colitis flare. His current dose of prednisone was 10 mg once a day. Soon after symptoms begun, he had been placed on ciprofloxacin as treatment for a presumptive flare.
Physical exam showed he was afebrile, with a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, respiratory 16 breaths per minute and blood pressure 115/67 mmHg. He was alert although with a sallow appearance. Abdominal exam revealed a soft nontender nondistended abdomen. Rectal showed normal external exam with grossly bloody stool. Initial blood work showed hemoglobin of 12.3, a normal white blood cell count, normal differential and normal platelet count with a mildly elevated prothrombin time of 16.2 with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2. Urine analysis showed a specific gravity of 1.035, 3+blood, +ketones and > 100 RBC per high powered field and 0–5 WBC per high power field. Abdominal ultrasound revealed irregular shaped bladder wall.
Patient was placed on intravenous fluids (IV) as well as metronidazole (IV). Blood and urine cultures were sent for analysis. Stool was sent for culture and for Clostridium difficile toxin analysis.
Serial repeat lab works the following day revealed a dropping hemoglobin (7.4 g/dL) and platelet count (64 K/mm3) increasing PT/PTT (21.3/47 seconds) with an INR of 1.8. Blood smear showed moderate amount of elliptocytes, schistocytes, microcytes and fragmented red blood cells. Initial DIC panel revealed an elevated D-dimer of 4.9 mcg/mL with a normal thrombin time and fibrinogen. Thrombin time subsequently increased to > 120 seconds. D-dimers increased to 10.3 mcg/mL. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a marked thickening and irregularity of the bladder wall as well as wall thickening of the rectosigmoid, ascending, transverse, and descending colon (Figure ). Urology was consulted and felt that this represented a submucosal hematoma.
Patient was begun on broad-spectrum antibiotics because of concerns regarding possible bacteremia and a worsening DIC laboratory picture. Blood, stool and urine cultures returned negative. Viral cultures and monoclonal antibody staining for adenovirus detection in the urine was negative. Despite a worsening in the DIC panel, the patient remained clinically unchanged. IV steroids were begun approximately 36 hours into patient's hospital stay. Patient had a stabilization of PT/PTT/INR/thrombin time and D-dimer, and a subsequent normalization of labs over the following 4-day period ( Figure , , , , , , ). Patient's diarrhea and hematuria resolved as well. Colonscopy revealed chronic colitis consistent with ulcerative colitis. Cystoscopy revealed a fibrin clot consistent with submucosal hematoma.

34,526761-1,15494069,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC526761.xml,First successful case of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer with venom immunotherapy for hymenoptera sting allergy,"A 39 year-old Caucasian G4P1031 was referred for evaluation and management of recurrent pregnancy loss. Medical history was significant for known carrier state for β-thalassemia. Mild hypothyroidism had been diagnosed in 2002 with immediate initiation of replacement therapy. The patient was a non-smoker, in good general health and had no gynecologic complaint. BMI was 21.7 kg/m2. In 1997, she experienced a severe hypotensive anaphylactic reaction following a yellow jacket sting (Vespula spp.) resulting in a full allergy work-up. The patient began subcutaneous injection of 100 mcg mixed vespid hymenoptera venom/venom protein (Pharmalgen®; ALK Abello, Hørsholm, Denmark) every 5–6 weeks, which was well tolerated.
All four conceptions were established without medical assistance, involved the same partner, and were achieved after the hymenoptera hypersensitivity diagnosis. The initial pregnancy occurred three years before presentation and resulted in a first trimester spontaneous abortion. No adjustment was made to the allergy injection regimen during that pregnancy. Fetal cardiac activity was initially present, but was lost at 10 weeks' gestation for unknown reasons. No curettage was performed.
One year later, a second pregnancy was established but for this pregnancy hymenoptera venom therapy was discontinued when pregnancy was first recognized (~6 weeks). A 3170 g female infant was delivered vaginally at 40 1/2 weeks' gestation. In 2001 and 2002, the patient established two additional pregnancies and hymenoptera therapy was maintained at 5–6 week intervals for both; both resulted in first trimester spontaneous abortions. For these miscarriages, dilation and curettage was undertaken but no karyotype was performed and no cause for the losses was identified.
At our institution, euthyroid status was verified, the thalassemia carrier state was confirmed, and we identified a new homozygous A223V mutation at the methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) locus. Folic acid intake was immediately increased to 800 mcg/d, although a baseline serum homocysteine level was not measured. Factor V Leiden, protein S, protein C, and other coagulation tests were normal, as were karyotypes obtained from both partners. Anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid and antiovarian antibody titres were all negative. However, transvaginal saline uterine sonography revealed a uniform 5 mm echodense lesion consistent with an endometrial polyp. Outpatient hysteroscopic polypectomy was performed without complication. After discussing various infertility therapies and associated success rates given her age, the patient elected to undergo IVF.
In March 2003, the patient began programmed ovarian hyperstimulation using a combined recombinant-FSH+hMG protocol (300 IU/d Humegon®, Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Tarrytown, NY USA and 300 IU/d Gonal-F®, Serono Labs; Norwell, MA USA). Pre-treatment pituitary downregulation was achieved via 5 u/d leuprolide acetate and was continued × 3 d after gonadotropin therapy commenced. No alteration was made in the patient's allergy injection sequence during ovulation induction (i.e., 100 mcg every 5–6 weeks), and serum yellow jacket RAST IgE measurements were obtained via commercial fluoroimmunoassay including positive and negative controls (UniCAP® IgE kit, Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden). While absolute IgE levels remained <0.35 kU/l throughout therapy, percentage IgE results were variable and these data are summarized in Figure .
On cycle day 10, subcutaneous hCG (10,000 IU) was given [] with serum estradiol at 1090 pg/ml. Twelve oocytes were retrieved and 7 advanced to the 2pn stage following conventional insemination. A four-day course of methylprednisolone (16 mg/d) was started on the day of oocyte retrieval. On post-fertilization day three, the ultrasound-guided transfer of four embryos was performed. Immediately following embryo transfer, the patient was placed on oral aspirin (81 mg/d) and subcutaneous heparin (5,000 IU b.i.d). Luteal phase support was administered as daily 50 mg IM progsterone in oil injections.
Two weeks after embryo transfer, serum hCG was 72 mIU/ml. On May 5, 2003, transvaginal ultrasound confirmed a single intrauterine pregnancy with fetal cardiac rate at 126/min. Progesterone was discontinued at the 10th gestational week. Immunology and perinatology consultants agreed with reduced dose allergy protocol through the third trimester, and hymenoptera venom protein extract (75 mcg) treatment was maintained to 32 weeks gestation. The patient experienced no untoward reaction or hypersensitivity to gonadotropins, VIT, or supplementary progesterone during therapy.
At 32 weeks, obstetrical sonogram suggested reduced amniotic fluid levels and the patient was given intramuscular betamethasone (12 mg/d × 2 days) and placed on bedrest. At this point allergy injections were discontinued since the patient was not outdoors and risk for insect sting was regarded as low. Intravenous oxytocin was started at 35 weeks due to oligohydramnios and resulted in vaginal delivery of a 2495 g female infant. Mother and baby were discharged home after an uncomplicated two-day postpartum course. Allergy injections resumed (100 mcg every 5–6 weeks) when breastfeeding was completed three months later.","[[39.0, 'year']]",F,2004,"['gynecologic', 'cardiac', 'vaginally', 'methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) locus', 'uterine', 'endometrial', 'ovarian', 'pituitary', 'Luteal', 'transvaginal', 'intrauterine', 'cardiac', 'vaginal']","['G4P1031', 'pregnancy loss', 'thalassemia', 'hypothyroidism', 'non-smoker', 'good general health', 'gynecologic complaint', 'hypotensive anaphylactic reaction', 'yellow jacket sting', 'Vespula spp', 'well tolerated', 'hymenoptera hypersensitivity', 'pregnancy', 'spontaneous abortion', 'pregnancy', 'Fetal cardiac activity', 'gestation', 'pregnancy', 'pregnancy', 'pregnancy', 'delivered', 'delivered vaginally', 'gestation', 'pregnancies', 'spontaneous abortions', 'miscarriages', 'cause for the losses', 'euthyroid', 'thalassemia carrier state', 'homozygous A223V mutation', 'echodense lesion', 'endometrial polyp', 'complication', 'pituitary downregulation', 'oocytes', 'intrauterine pregnancy', 'gestation', 'untoward reaction', 'hypersensitivity to gonadotropins, VIT, or supplementary progesterone', 'reduced amniotic fluid levels', 'insect sting', 'oligohydramnios', 'vaginal delivery']","['mixed vespid hymenoptera venom/venom protein', 'Pharmalgen®', 'Humegon®', 'Gonal-F®', 'leuprolide acetate', 'hCG', 'serum estradiol', 'methylprednisolone', 'aspirin', 'heparin', 'progsterone', 'Progesterone', 'betamethasone', 'oxytocin']","['39', '2002', '1997', '2001', '2002', 'March 2003', 'Norwell', 'Sweden', 'May 5, 2003']","['replacement therapy', 'BMI', 'allergy work-up', 'allergy injection regimen', 'curettage', 'hymenoptera venom therapy', 'hymenoptera therapy', 'dilation', 'dilation and curettage', 'karyotype', 'Folic acid intake', 'baseline serum homocysteine level', 'Factor V Leiden', 'protein S', 'protein C', 'coagulation tests', 'karyotypes', 'Anticardiolipin', 'antiphospholipid', 'antiovarian antibody titres', 'transvaginal saline uterine sonography', 'hysteroscopic polypectomy', 'infertility therapies', 'IVF', 'programmed ovarian hyperstimulation', 'combined recombinant-FSH+hMG protocol', 'gonadotropin therapy', 'allergy injection sequence', 'ovulation induction', 'serum yellow jacket RAST IgE measurements', 'fluoroimmunoassay', 'IgE levels', 'therapy', 'IgE', 'hCG', 'Twelve oocytes were retrieved', 'conventional insemination', 'oocyte retrieval', 'ultrasound-guided transfer of four embryos', 'embryo transfer', 'Luteal phase support', 'embryo transfer', 'serum hCG', 'transvaginal ultrasound', 'fetal cardiac rate', 'Progesterone', 'allergy protocol', 'hymenoptera venom protein extract', 'therapy', 'obstetrical sonogram', 'bedrest', 'allergy injections', 'Allergy injections', 'breastfeeding']","['in 2002', 'three years', 'first trimester', '10 weeks', '10 weeks', 'One year later', '6 weeks', '40 1/2 weeks', '40 1/2 weeks', 'first trimester', 'March 2003', 'post-fertilization day three', 'Two weeks', 'May 5, 2003', '10th gestational week', 'third trimester', '32 weeks']"
35,526763-1,15485571,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC526763.xml,Traumatic deep vein thrombosis in a soccer player: A case study,"A 42 year old Polish born male former semi-professional soccer player was seen on May 16th, 2003 in the emergency department, with the chief complaint of right leg pain. The patient had been playing soccer 10 days prior to this visit, and recalled a traumatic ""tackle"" injury to the posterior area of his right lower extremity. He denied experiencing any sensation of tearing or popping in the right knee during the index trauma, and was able to complete the game with only minor discomfort. On day 3 post-injury the patient noted severe pain in his knee and calf with ambulation. The patient visited his primary doctor on post-injury day 8 and was diagnosed with a right lower extremity soft tissue injury. A right lower extremity echo-doppler ultrasound (US), and a semi-quantitative D-dimer automated latex procedure were ordered to rule out a vascular disorder. The US investigation demonstrated a DVT in the distal femoral, popliteal, and distal calf veins, with a heterogenous mass (5 cm × 3 cm × 4 cm, resembling a hematoma) without a doppler signal in the right popliteal fossa. The D-dimer result was also positive for a suspected thrombosis (1.0–2.0 ug/ml; range = <0.25 ug/ml). The patient was instructed by his physician to proceed immediately to the emergency department for further evaluation and treatment.
The past medical and family history of the patient was non-contributory for a history of thrombophilia or other thrombotic major risk factors. The patient had a remote (11 years old) surgical history of a right-sided inguinal hernia that could have created scar tissue contributing to vascular obstruction and stasis. The initial emergency department examination demonstrated an exquisitely tender right calf with a 3 cm difference in mid-calf girth (10 cm. distal from each inferior patellar pole); a 1+ right knee supra patellar effusion; and a palpable popliteal mass with visible ecchymosis. Laboratory tests (CBC, Lytes, PT, PTT, ESR, CPK, Anti-throbomin, Factor V Leiden, Lupus Screen, ANA, Anti-Cardiolipin, Protein C, and Protein S) were negative for metabolic, hematological or familial abnormalities. A repeat US investigation confirmed the results of the previous outpatient results. The patient was anticoagulated simultaneously with unfractionated heparin and Warfarin sulfate. A multiview plain film x-ray examination of the right lower extremity demonstrated no fracture, dislocation, or bony mass.
A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the right knee was done several days after admission, to verify a torn right knee meniscal cartilage that had been previously diagnosed. The official MRI radiological report included a small free-edge tear of the posterior horn root junction of the lateral meniscus, chondromalasia (lateral patella and lateral femoral articular cartilage), and a moderate joint effusion with a bursal cyst or dilated semimembranous-gastronemius bursa.
Anticoagulation was achieved on day 6 of the patient's hospitalization. He was discharged on 5 mg of warfarin per day, with instructions to continue the use of compression stockings. The patient was also advised to follow up with his primary physician for regular monitoring, and to avoid contact or collision activities during anticoagulation.
The patient was maintained on warfarin for six months, with weekly physician monitoring (symptoms, PT, INR) for the first three months post-injury. The monitoring interval was changed to once per month for the remainder of the treatment period. Hematologic investigations (APTT, PT, INR, Cardiolipin antibody, C-reactive protein, Lupant anticoagulant, Factor V Leiden, Antithrombin, ANA, Protein C, Protein S, and RPR) were obtained three months post injury. There were no contributory thrombophilic factors found in these investigations. Laboratory levels of Protein C activity 22% (range = 70–140%), Protein S activity 48% (range = 75–140%), INR 2.57 (range = 0.88–1.12), and PT 27.5 sec (range = 9.6–12.0 sec); APTT 38.5 sec (range = 23.4–35.4 sec) were found to be appropriately reactive to the anticoagulant therapy.
The patient underwent two arthrocentesis procedures to remove small amounts of serous fluid from the joint, and each time was injected with a lidocaine/corticosteroid combination. US examinations after the hospitalization period failed to demonstrate a recurrence or new onset of DVT, however residual echogenic material characteristic of a chronic thrombus was demonstrated in the popliteal vein. Compression stocking use was maintained after hospital discharge, and was discontinued after nine months. The patient returned to soccer after anticoagulation, with a full understanding of his increased risk of DVT recurrence.
One-year post injury the patient continued to suffer from intermittent right lower extremity discomfort and swelling often unrelated to activity. An elective arthroscopy was recently performed on the patient's right knee to investigate his long-standing meniscal disruption and effusion. The arthroscopy demonstrated several areas of arthrosis (patellar lateral and medial facets, lateral and medial femoral condyles), and a torn lateral meniscus. Appropriate partial lateral menisectomy and debridement, and chondroplasty of the areas of arthrosis were preformed. An arthroscopic examination of the posterior compartment demonstrated a small cleft-like area just medial to the semimembranosis where the Baker's cyst likely originated. The patient returned to the orthopedist one week post-op with a large (150 cc's) hemarthrosis that was aspirated from the knee. He was requested to follow-up in one month for re-evaluation.","[[42.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['right leg', 'posterior area of his right lower extremity', 'right knee', 'knee', 'calf', 'right lower extremity soft tissue', 'right lower extremity', 'distal femoral', 'popliteal', 'distal calf veins', 'right popliteal fossa', 'right-sided inguinal', 'tissue', 'right calf', 'mid-calf', 'distal from each inferior patellar pole', 'right knee supra patellar', 'popliteal', 'right lower extremity', 'bony', 'right knee', 'right knee meniscal cartilage', 'posterior horn root junction of the lateral meniscus', 'lateral meniscus', 'lateral patella', 'lateral femoral articular cartilage', 'joint', 'bursal', 'semimembranous-gastronemius bursa', 'joint', 'popliteal vein', 'right lower extremity', 'right knee', 'meniscal', 'lateral and medial femoral condyles', 'lateral meniscus', 'posterior compartment', 'semimembranosis', 'knee']","['right leg pain', 'traumatic ""tackle"" injury', 'sensation of tearing', 'popping', 'index trauma', 'able to complete the game', 'discomfort', 'pain', 'right lower extremity soft tissue injury', 'vascular disorder', 'DVT', 'heterogenous mass', 'hematoma', 'doppler signal', 'thrombosis', 'thrombophilia', 'thrombotic major', 'right-sided inguinal hernia', 'scar tissue', 'obstruction', 'stasis', 'tender right calf', 'difference in mid-calf girth', 'right knee supra patellar effusion', 'popliteal mass', 'ecchymosis', 'metabolic', 'hematological', 'familial abnormalities', 'fracture', 'dislocation', 'bony mass', 'torn', 'torn right knee meniscal cartilage', 'free-edge tear of the posterior horn root junction of the lateral meniscus', 'chondromalasia', 'joint effusion', 'bursal cyst', 'dilated semimembranous-gastronemius bursa', 'symptoms', 'injury', 'thrombophilic factors', 'serous fluid', 'DVT', 'echogenic material', 'thrombus', 'DVT', 'injury', 'discomfort', 'swelling', 'disruption', 'effusion', 'torn lateral meniscus', 'arthrosis', 'cleft-like area just medial to the semimembranosis', ""Baker's cyst"", 'hemarthrosis']","['heparin', 'Warfarin', 'Warfarin sulfate', 'warfarin', 'warfarin', 'lidocaine', 'corticosteroid']","['42', 'former semi-professional soccer player', 'May 16th, 2003', 'emergency department', 'emergency department', '11', 'emergency department']","['echo-doppler ultrasound (US)', 'semi-quantitative D-dimer automated latex', 'semi-quantitative D-dimer automated latex procedure', 'US', 'D-dimer', 'treatment', 'examination', 'Laboratory tests', 'CBC', 'Lytes', 'PT', 'PTT', 'ESR', 'CPK', 'Anti-throbomin', 'Factor V Leiden', 'Lupus Screen', 'ANA', 'Anti-Cardiolipin', 'Protein C', 'Protein S', 'US', 'anticoagulated', 'multiview plain film x-ray examination of the right lower extremity', 'magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the right knee', 'MRI', 'Anticoagulation', 'use of compression stockings', 'avoid contact or collision activities', 'anticoagulation', 'PT', 'INR', 'Hematologic', 'Hematologic investigations', 'APTT', 'PT', 'INR', 'Cardiolipin antibody', 'C-reactive protein', 'Lupant anticoagulant', 'Factor V Leiden', 'Antithrombin', 'ANA', 'Protein C', 'Protein S', 'RPR', 'Laboratory levels', 'Laboratory levels of Protein C activity', 'Protein C activity', 'Protein S activity', 'INR', 'PT', 'APTT', 'anticoagulant therapy', 'arthrocentesis procedures to remove small amounts of serous fluid from the joint', 'corticosteroid', 'US examinations', 'Compression stocking', 'Compression stocking use', 'anticoagulation', 'elective arthroscopy', 'arthroscopy', 'partial lateral menisectomy', 'debridement', 'chondroplasty of the areas of arthrosis', 'arthroscopic examination of the posterior compartment', 'aspirated']","['10 days', 'prior to this visit', 'On day 3', 'post-injury', 'post-injury', 'on day 6', 'three months post', 'three months post', 'three months post', 'three months post', 'three months post', 'three months post', 'three months post', 'three months post', 'three months post', 'One-year post', 'one week', 'post-op']"
36,526770-1,15507139,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC526770.xml,"Increased deep sleep in a medication-free, detoxified female offender with schizophrenia, alcoholism and a history of attempted homicide: Case report","The patient was a 23-year-old woman charged with attempted manslaughter. She was ordered by the court to undergo a pre-trial forensic psychiatric examination which took place in a maximum security state mental hospital. The trial records and all available background information were reviewed. Both of her parents were alcoholics and she was taken to protective custody under the age of one year. Her grandmother suffered from schizophrenia and her mother had been in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt. The patient used to shoplift before the age of 15 and later she stole money from time to time. She also worked as a prostitute to earn money. She started to abuse alcohol at the age of 15. She had several boyfriends but has never married and has no children. Her personality was noticed to change before the age of 17. She started to have obsessive-compulsive behaviour, paranoid thoughts as well as depressive symptoms. She tried to kill herself by hanging and by several drug intoxications. She brutally killed her own pet. She was never hospitalized before the forensic mental examination but she irregularly visited an outpatient clinic. Despite psychiatric treatment, she impulsively tried to kill her male friend with whom she was drinking. During the psychiatric examination the diagnoses – schizophrenia paranoid type, alcohol dependence and features of antisocial personality disorder – were made by a senior forensic psychiatrist using the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV, SCID I and II [,]. Neither waking EEG nor brain MRI (1.5T) disclosed any abnormality. She had no somatic disorders. She had finished high school and vocational school, and was within average intelligence (WAIS-IQ total 109). She was not sentenced, but was ordered by the Finnish National Board of Medico-Legal Affairs to stay in the state mental hospital as a criminally insane patient. The sleep recordings were performed during the psychiatric examination period and the patient was completely medication-free and had abstained from alcohol and drugs for six months.
The control group consisted of three 23-year-old female students without criminal records or a history of physical violence. They were healthy with no signs of somatic, psychiatric, or neurological disorders. As part of a psychiatric interview, the SCID-non-patient version [] was filled in. To exclude general diseases that could affect sleep, blood tests (including serum prolactin, thyroid function, kidney and liver function) and electrocardiograms were taken and they were within normal range, both in the patient and in controls. No history of alcohol abuse or dependence was detected in controls. The controls were asked to avoid alcohol, drugs or medication two weeks prior to the sleep examinations. Caffeine and nicotine consumption was neither restricted nor recorded.
Written consent was obtained from all participants after the study procedure had been fully explained to them. The study was approved by the local human ethics committee.
Polysomnography (PSG) was recorded over two consecutive nights but only the second night was considered for the study. The study patient slept in a single room within the department, while controls slept in the hospital guest room. All participants were allowed to sleep as long as they wanted to. Recordings took place on an ambulatory basis; the participant had a portable recording device (Embla, Flaga hf, Reykjavik, Iceland) that was connected to the recording electrodes. The recordings were performed using the standard Rechtschaffen-Kales method []. The high-pass filter was 0.5 Hz and the low-pass filter 45 Hz, with a sampling rate of 100 Hz. Commercial software (Somnologica, version 2.0, Flaga hf, Reykjavik, Iceland) was used for scoring and calculation of sleep parameters. Sleep onset was defined as the first occurrence of three consecutive epochs (90 sec) of stage 1 (S1) or other sleep stages. The following parameters were calculated: time in bed, sleep latency, sleep period (time in bed – sleep latency), wake after sleep onset, total sleep time (sleep period – wake after sleep onset), sleep efficiency (total sleep time/sleep period), number of awakenings, REM latency and percentage amounts of different sleep stages (S1–S4 %, REM %). All data for the analysis were scored by the same scorer (NL), not blinded to the patient group.
A sleep diary was used for one week during the study period to ensure a normal sleep-wake rhythm and to exclude the effects of daytime naps. The participant filled in the time of retiring to bed, estimated time of falling asleep and time of awakening in the morning for each consecutive night as well as daytime naps.","[[23.0, 'year']]",F,2004,"['brain', 'psychiatric', 'neurological', 'thyroid', 'kidney', 'liver']","['attempted manslaughter', 'alcoholics', 'schizophrenia', 'suicide attempt', 'abuse alcohol', 'personality was noticed to change', 'obsessive-compulsive behaviour', 'paranoid thoughts', 'depressive symptoms', 'tried to kill herself', 'drug intoxications', 'brutally killed her own pet', 'impulsively tried to kill her male friend', 'schizophrenia paranoid type', 'alcohol dependence', 'antisocial personality disorder', 'DSM-IV', 'SCID I and II', 'abnormality', 'somatic disorders', 'within average intelligence', 'physical violence', 'healthy', 'somatic, psychiatric, or neurological disorders', 'general diseases', 'alcohol abuse or dependence', 'normal sleep-wake rhythm']",[],"['23', 'court', 'security state mental hospital', '15', 'prostitute', 'earn money', '15', '17', 'outpatient clinic', 'state mental hospital', 'criminally insane', '23']","['forensic psychiatric examination', 'forensic mental examination', 'psychiatric treatment', 'EEG', 'brain MRI', 'WAIS-IQ total', 'sleep recordings', 'medication-free', 'abstained from alcohol and drugs', 'blood tests', 'serum prolactin', 'thyroid function', 'kidney and liver function', 'electrocardiograms', 'avoid alcohol, drugs or medication', 'sleep examinations', 'Polysomnography', 'PSG', 'Sleep onset', 'time in bed', 'sleep latency', 'sleep period', 'wake after sleep onset', 'total sleep time', 'sleep period', 'wake after sleep onset', 'sleep efficiency', 'total sleep time/sleep period', 'number of awakenings', 'REM latency', 'percentage amounts of different sleep stages', 'REM', 'sleep diary']","['two weeks', 'one week']"

He had smoked 2 packs/day cigarettes for 3 years and has been ex-smoker for 5 years. He experienced frequent sudden-onset coughing episodes followed by the development of dyspnea and wheezing a year ago. He was previously diagnosed with difficult asthma and treated with high dose inhaled corticosteroids (1600 μg budesonide) and bronchodilators. Since he was unresponsive to the therapy, he has applied to several institutions for multiple times to seek medical attention.
On admission, no stridor, wheezing and cyanosis were present and the general appearance was good. Vital signs were as follows: temperature 37°C, respiratory rate 20/min, pulse 96 beats/min, blood pressure 140/70 mmHg. The chest examination was unremarkable. The results of the routine laboratory analysis, including complete blood cell count, chemistry, arterial blood gas, urinalysis and chest x-ray were within normal ranges. On spirometric examination, flow-volume curve displayed suggestive fixed airway obstruction. Forced vital capacity (FVC) was 122 % of predicted, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 31 % of predicted and FEV1/FVC was 21 % (Figure ). In order to exclude the possibility of upper airway obstruction, a work-up of computerized tomography (CT) of the chest and fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) was obtained. The CT scan illustrated a solid, polipoid intratracheal mass originating from the right side of the trachea at 4 centimeter proximal of the carina (Figure ). FOB revealed a smooth, round mass of 2 cm in diameter originating from the right lateral side of the trachea. The lesion was occupying approximately 50 % of the lumen (Figure ). It localized at 4th centimeter distal to larynx. Histopathological diagnosis was adenoid cystic carcinoma of the trachea.
The patient underwent resection surgery. At the operational site, there were severe adhesions between the mediastinal surface and the trachea. Therefore, a conservative surgery was performed. The tumor was seen on the right anterolateral wall of the trachea being expanded submucosally from the carina to the proximal end of the trachea.
The patient underwent adjuvant radiation therapy after the operation. CT scan of the neck revealed resolution of the tumor (Figure ).

The patient had been treated elsewhere for one month for pain and redness of both breasts and fever (≥ 38°C). There was no generalized lymphadenopathy. On gastroscopic examination multiple small ulcers were observed in the stomach. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan showed liver tumor and a normal spleen. Hematological and biochemical examination at admission showed the following results: RBC 352 × 104/mm3, hemoglobin 10.3 g/dl (post transfusion), WBC 4,900/mm3, Platelets 51,000/mm3, serum albumin 1.5 g/dl, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl, AST 691 IU/l, ALT 187 IU/l, LDH 2976 IU/l, fibrinogen 134 mg/dl, FDP 10 μg/ml, and AT-III 40%. Bleeding from the stomach continued and did not stop with conservative treatment; therefore, two days later the patient underwent total gastrectomy and a partial liver resection. Histopathology of the resected specimen showed it to be a gastric lymphoma (pleomorphic medium-large cell type, non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma) with liver metastasis (Fig. ). From first postoperative day (POD), bleeding from the esophagojejunostomy continued; the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and died on 8th postoperative day.
On autopsy, malignant lymphoid cell infiltration and hemophagocytosis were observed in the liver, spleen, heart, small bowel, lung, both breasts, kidney, pancreas, uterus, and gastroduodenal lymph nodes (Fig. ). The bone marrow presented hyperplasia and hemophagocytic macrophages but no infiltration by lymphoma cells.

The patient's past medical history was significant for tuberous sclerosis (diagnosed previously based on seizures, radiographic evidence suggestive of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, cutaneous hypopigmented macules and bilateral cystic renal disease that culminated in end-stage renal disease in 1989). A transvaginal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous complex adnexal mass whose size was estimated at 7.0 × 4.8 cm. Also noted was a well-defined lesion (<1.0 cm) in the uterine cervix (figure ); the clinical impression of the latter lesion was a leiomyoma. CA-125 (13 U/ml) and CA19-9 (21 U/ml) levels were within normal limits. The decision was made to resect the adnexal mass and in November 2001, the patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The surgical procedure was complicated by severe intra abdominal adhesions (secondary to long-term peritoneal dialysis), the lyses of which resulted in two inadvertent nicks to small bowel segments that necessitated the excision of those segments. The patient did not receive any adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, and she remains alive with no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease after 35 months of close surveillance.
Standard representative sections, including the entirety of the uterine cervix were processed routinely for microscopic examination. Sections were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Selected sections were stained for Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) with and without diastase pre-digestion. The immunohistochemical profile of the tumor was evaluated on 4μ thick, formalin-fixed, deparaffinized sections using a DAKO Autostainer (Carpinteria, CA, USA) based on the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. Specifications for the various immunohistochemical stains that were utilized are listed in table . The extent and intensity of the immunoreactivity for each antibody was scored semi-quantitatively on a 1+(+) to 4+(++++) scale representing increasing staining extent and intensity. Labeling index for Ki-67 was calculated by assessing at least 4000 cells and determining the percentage showing unequivocal nuclear staining. In our literature review, the significance of the differences between the group means of two continuous variables (patient age and sizes of lesions) was determined using the student's t-test (Excel®, Microsoft Inc, Redmond, WA). DNA ploidy analysis was performed on isolated tumor nuclei according to standard procedures. Comparative genomic hybridization [] was performed on tumor tissue samples from the cervical mass as previously described [].
Gross and microscopic assessment of the left adnexal mass showed it to be a 7 cm hemorrhagic cyst devoid of any specific lining and involving the ovarian parenchyma. For the uterine cervical mass, a distinct lesion was not grossly appreciated. The ectocervical and endocervical surfaces and the endometrial cavity were described as unremarkable. Microscopically, the cervical mass was unencapsulated but possessed a deceptively circumscribed appearance at scanning magnification, attributable to the architectural homogeneity of its ""core"" (Figure ). However, the peripheral regions of the tumor showed a significant degree of infiltration. The tumor's maximal dimension was estimated at 2.2 cm, extending from just below the ectocervical basement membrane (Figure ) and extending proximally to the lower uterine segment and attaining 2 cm in depth (the peripheral limits of the tumor were at least 1 cm from the parametrial margins). The aforementioned central ""core"" (1 cm) was probably responsible for its radiographic appearance and consisted of fascicles of spindle cells with a smooth muscle appearance (Figure ). The spindle cells displayed bland nuclei with regularly distributed chromatin and only rarely conspicuous nucleoli. Towards the periphery, the spindle cells displayed increasingly PAS+, diastase sensitive cytoplasm (Figure ), although occasional cells displayed dense eosinophilia. At its most peripheral regions, the tumor was composed predominantly of solid sheets of large epithelioid cells with bland nuclear features, abundant clear cytoplasm, and well-defined cytoplasmic membranes. Although predominantly solid in the epithelioid regions, a pseudo-alveolar pattern was also evident (Figure ). At the most proximal regions near the lower uterine segment, the tumor appeared to be ""invading"" in single cells in a hyalinized stroma. The nuclei of the epithelioid cells showed a mild to moderate degree of nuclear atypia, manifested mostly as nucleomegaly and irregularity of nuclear membranes in the absence of hyperchromasia. Rare cells displayed bizarrely enlarged nuclei and multinucleation with a ""smudged"" chromatin pattern consistent with degenerative atypia (Figure ). Also identified in these regions were CD68+ foamy histiocytes mostly in single cells but occasionally in aggregates especially around the endocervical glands. No tumor necrosis was identified and mitotic figures were extremely sparse (<1/50 HPF). Small arching sinusoidal vessels were prominent throughout the tumor, but no large malformed vascular profiles were present. Pigment-laden cells and adipocytes were not present in the cervical mass. Small bowel segments measuring 21 cm in total length were also processed. Grossly, irregular areas of transmural thickening were noted. Microscopically, aggregates of epithelioid cells with more eosinophillic cytoplasm and vacuolated cytoplasm were noted in the lamina propria in two out of twelve sections (Figure ). In the both ovaries, similar aggregates of cells were present in a distinctive perivascular location in the hilar regions. These aggregates were either subendothelial (predominantly), adventitially attached to affected vessels, or present as free aggregates in the perihilar fat (Figure ). Each measured less than 1 mm in maximum dimension. No intraluminal tumor cells were seen. CGH and DNA ploidy analysis of the cervical mass showed a balanced chromosomal profile (figure ) and diploid nuclei, respectively. Immunohistochemically, both the epithelioid cells and spindle cells stained diffusely with HMB-45 (Figure ) and Melan-A in a cytoplasmic pattern at all sites (cervix, ovary, bowel). Scattered spindle cells showed unequivocal immunoreactivity for S100 while the epithelioid cells were negative. Both components showed at least focal immunoreactivity for muscle markers: smooth muscle actin and desmin with the spindle cells predominating both in the quantity of cell stained and the intensity of staining where positive.

Five years ago, he was diagnosed with hyperthyreosis caused by Plummer's disease. Laboratory findings revealed a repressed TSH of 0.01 mU/L (0.4–4.0 mU/L). The patient was treated with radioiodine therapy. Today he suffers from hypothyreosis and a daily substitution of 100 μg L-Thyroxin is performed. Within the months following the radioiodine therapy, an erythema progressing into a manifest pretibial myxedema developed, followed by exophthalmus and fibromatosis of the right hand within the next three years. Surgical orbita decompression due to massive exophthalmus was performed, followed by a subsequent correction of the ocular muscles. Additionally, the fibromatosis of the right hand was excised. Retrospective histological findings revealed a regressive sclerotic fibrosis of firm kollagenous fibers embedded in soft and fat tissue were consistent with a generalized fibrosing process as known in myxedema. Within the last months, decent mucous plaques of the upper limps decreased. The patient now reported progressing congestion of lymph and decreasing flexibility of the lower legs caused by the pretibial myxedema. Clinical examination confirmed massive pretibial myxedema, lymphatic congestion of the lower legs, generalized myxedema accentuating the upper limps, a residual postsurgical nodular tumor of the ulnar aspect of the right hand, exophthalmus, and severe hypertrophic osteopathy of the distal phalanges with clubbed fingers and hippocratic nails (Fig. ). A Complete check-up including autoantibodies remained unremarkable. Under substitution of 100 μg L-Throxin daily we found the following thyroidal values: T3 0.94 ng/ml (0.59–1.74), T4 10.17 μg/dl (4.50–12.00), TSH 0.47 μIE/ml (0.38–4.70), fT3 2.64 pg/ml (1.45–3.48), fT4 1.44 ng/dl (0.71–1.85).

He had then experienced symptoms for a few years that had aggravated during the last six to eight months. Using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rate Scale (MADRS) the patient scored 24 points and was diagnosed as having a clinical depression. He did not take any medication and had no regular medical contact. The patient did not have any history of allergy or dermatological diseases. However, he sometimes suffered from vasomotor rhinitis after drinking red wine. The doctor prescribed fluoxetine 20 mg daily as antidepressive treatment. At the revisit three weeks later the patient was very pleased with the fluoxetine treatment and reported that he ""had not felt better in 20 years"" although he initially had experienced slight nausea and insomnia.
A week later, he visited his doctor due to an itching rash that had started the day before. The doctor noted partly confluent urticae on the abdomen, a modest periorbital oedema and red, warm palms and wrists. An ADR induced by fluoxetine was suspected and fluoxetine treatment was discontinued. The symptoms were treated with 2 mg clemastine and 6 mg betametasone orally and disappeared within 48 hours. However, the symptoms of depression returned. Sertraline medication was initiated 10 days after the cessation of fluoxetine treatment since SSRI medication had shown good effect. During the weeks of sertraline treatment no urticarial symptoms appeared. The patient improved in his depression although full recovery was not achieved this time. After approximately two weeks of sertraline treatment he noted an intense itching sensation in his scalp after eating a piece of chocolate cake. The itch spread to the arms, abdomen and legs within a few hours. This time the patient did not seek his doctor but treated himself with clemastine and the itch disappeared during the night. He now remembered that he had had a chocolate mousse dessert before the first episode. Since he had never had any reaction from eating chocolate before, he found this observation so striking that he reported it to his doctor. The patient, himself a scientist, later tried small doses of chocolate and skin rash and itch appeared at an intensity that to him seemed dependent on the ""dose"" of chocolate ingested.
It has been known for 30 years that serotonin can stimulate cutaneous C-fibres [], the type of fibres that is also known to transmit itch []. Moreover, serotonin injections into the skin can induce itch [] and pruritus is a component in 24% of reported skin reactions to fluoxetine in Sweden, the corresponding figure for sertraline is 15 % []. However, attempts to treat pruritus using 5-HT3-receptor-antagonists have not given clear-cut results [-]. The enzymes necessary for conversion of tryptophan to serotonin are expressed in human skin []. In addition, 5-HT2AR are present in one third of unmyelinated axons at the dermal and epidermo-dermal junctional area []. An altered localisation pattern of serotonin receptors 5-HT1AR, 5-HT2AR and 5-HT3R has been reported in contact eczematous skin together with increased serotonin concentrations [,] indicating the presence of a serotonin system in the skin that can be altered in pathologic conditions. Moreover, a cross-sensitivity has been reported when skin rash developed after both paroxetine and sertraline medication []. Since these substances are structurally different, one interpretation is that the skin can react to an SSRI-induced increase in serotonin concentrations.
In the present case the patient experienced skin symptoms from two different SSRIs. However, these symptoms occurred only when he had eaten chocolate. Chocolate contains serotonin, at concentrations which depend on the type of chocolate []. A concentration of 1.4 – 5 μg / g has been reported in dark chocolate []. The present report suggests an interaction between SSRI-medication and chocolate leading to pruritus and rash. A plausible explanation is that SSRI together with serotonin-containing chocolate has increased serotonin concentration to a level where 5-HT receptors system at the dermal and epidermo-dermal junctional area are affected. Moreover, the patient in this case had previously noted nasal congestion and cough when he was drinking red wine. Red wine can induce release of serotonin from platelets [] and from the gut []. Serotonin can induce nasal itch, sneeze and hypersecretion [,].","[[46.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['abdomen', 'periorbital', 'palms', 'wrists', 'urticarial', 'scalp', 'arms', 'abdomen', 'legs', 'skin', 'cutaneous C-fibres', 'fibres', 'skin', 'skin', 'skin', 'dermal', 'epidermo-dermal junctional area', 'skin', 'serotonin system', 'skin', 'skin', 'skin', 'skin', '5-HT receptors system', 'epidermo-dermal junctional area', 'dermal', 'nasal', 'platelets', 'gut', 'nasal']","['depression', 'symptoms', 'depression', 'dermatological diseases', 'vasomotor rhinitis', 'not felt better', 'nausea', 'insomnia', 'itching rash', 'confluent urticae', 'periorbital oedema', 'red', 'warm', 'ADR induced', 'ADR induced by fluoxetine', 'symptoms', 'depression', 'good effect', 'urticarial symptoms', 'depression', 'full recovery', 'itching sensation', 'itch', 'itch', 'reaction from eating chocolate', 'skin rash', 'itch', 'itch', 'itch', 'pruritus', 'skin reactions to fluoxetine', 'pruritus', 'enzymes necessary for conversion of tryptophan to serotonin are expressed', '5-HT2AR are present in one third of unmyelinated axons', 'altered localisation pattern of serotonin receptors 5-HT1AR, 5-HT2AR and 5-HT3R', 'contact eczematous skin', 'increased serotonin concentrations', 'presence of a serotonin system in the skin', 'cross-sensitivity', 'skin rash', 'skin can react to an SSRI-induced increase in serotonin concentrations', 'skin symptoms', 'symptoms', 'pruritus', 'rash', 'increased serotonin concentration', 'affected', 'nasal congestion', 'cough', 'Red wine can induce release of serotonin from platelets [] and from the gut [', 'Serotonin can induce nasal itch', 'sneeze', 'hypersecretion']","['fluoxetine', 'fluoxetine', 'fluoxetine', 'fluoxetine', 'clemastine', 'betametasone', 'Sertraline', 'fluoxetine', 'sertraline', 'sertraline', 'clemastine', 'serotonin', 'serotonin', 'fluoxetine', 'sertraline', 'paroxetine', 'sertraline', 'serotonin', 'serotonin-containing chocolate']","['46', 'September 2003', 'Montgomery']","['medication', 'antidepressive treatment', 'fluoxetine treatment', 'SSRI medication', '5-HT3-receptor-antagonists', 'serotonin concentrations', 'medication', 'SSRI-induced', 'serotonin', 'SSRIs', 'SSRI', 'medication', 'SSRI']","['few years', 'last six to eight months', 'three weeks later', '20 years', 'A week later', 'day before', 'this time', 'within a few hours', 'during the night', '30 years']"

The injury happened at work while he was operating a machine of cotton elaboration.
On admission, routine laboratory investigations showed only elevated white blood cell count (12,400/mm3), while red blood cell count, haemoglobin, chemistry and urine analysis were within normal limits. Radiography of the bones of his left hand revealed fractures of the nail bones of the middle and the ring finger. Surgical debridement of the damaged soft tissue was undertaken with amputation of these two nail bones. The patient was hospitalized and intravenous therapy with ceforanide (1 g/12 h), ofloxacin (200 mg/12 h) and metronidazole (500 mg/8 h) was initiated.
Four days after his admission the injury of the hand became tender, erythematous, swelling and began to drain. The purulent material expressed from the hand was sent for culture. Three days later the lesion worsened and was complicated with lymphangitis. The patient was noted to be febrile (38.5°C) without any other systemic symptoms.
Physical examination revealed multiple erythematous subcutaneous nodules along the lymphatics extending up the patient's left forearm. These nodules were tender and painful. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. Debridement of the lesions was performed and the tissue was submitted for bacterial and fungal cultures. The Gram-stained smear showed polymorphonuclear leucocytes and Gram-positive fine, branching filaments, partially acid-fast, with a tendency to fragment into coccoid and bacillary forms.
Laboratory tests showed: white blood cell count (18,000/mm3), absolute neutrophil count, 12,780/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 75 mm/h; and C-reactive protein, 14.2 mg/dl (normal < 0.8 mg/dl).
After 5 days of incubation cultures of the pus and the tissue on Columbia blood agar grew white colonies adherent to the agar, rough with a velvety surface, having a characteristic mouldy odor (Figure ). Colonial characteristics, physiological properties and biochemical tests performed identified the isolate as Nocardia brasiliensis (Table ). Susceptibility to the antibiotics by the determination of the MICs using the E-test method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), showed that the isolate was sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and minocycline, intermediate to ciprofloxacin and resistant to ampicillin, second and third generation cephalosporins, erythromycin, clindamycin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin. The patient's antimicrobial therapy was changed to intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg b.i.d). The patient responded to therapy. Following 2 weeks of treatment the patient improved and all laboratory tests returned to normal. He was discharged 3 weeks after his admission on oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg b.i.d). The antibiotic therapy was continued for a total of 3 months. His hand and arm lesions were healing well and 6 months later revealed complete resolution of the infection without signs of recurrence.","[[32.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['index, middle and ring fingers of the left hand', 'bones of his left hand', 'left hand', 'nail bones of the middle', 'nail bones of the middle and the ring finger', 'soft tissue', 'two nail bones', 'hand', 'hand', 'subcutaneous', 'lymphatics', 'left forearm', 'tissue', 'pus', 'tissue', 'hand', 'arm']","['traumatic injuries', 'injury', 'fractures', 'damaged soft tissue', 'injury of the hand', 'tender', 'erythematous', 'swelling', 'began to drain', 'purulent material', 'purulent material expressed from the hand', 'lesion', 'lymphangitis', 'febrile', 'other systemic symptoms', 'erythematous subcutaneous nodules', 'nodules', 'regional lymphadenopathy', 'lesions', 'polymorphonuclear leucocytes', 'Gram-positive fine', 'branching filaments', 'acid-fast', 'tendency to fragment into coccoid and bacillary forms', 'white colonies adherent to the agar', 'Nocardia brasiliensis', 'Susceptibility to the antibiotics', 'responded to therapy', 'improved', 'lesions', 'infection']","['ceforanide', 'ofloxacin', 'metronidazole', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'amoxicillin-clavulanic acid', 'gentamicin', 'tobramycin', 'amikacin', 'minocycline', 'ciprofloxacin', 'ampicillin', 'erythromycin', 'clindamycin', 'ofloxacin', 'pefloxacin', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole']","['32', 'emergency department', 'Solna, Sweden']","['laboratory', 'white blood cell', 'white blood cell count', 'red blood cell count', 'haemoglobin', 'chemistry', 'urine analysis', 'Radiography of the bones of his left hand', 'Surgical debridement of the damaged soft tissue', 'amputation of these two nail bones', 'therapy', 'culture', 'Physical examination', 'Debridement of the lesions', 'bacterial and fungal cultures', 'fungal cultures', 'Gram-stained smear', 'Laboratory tests', 'white blood cell count', 'absolute neutrophil count', 'erythrocyte', 'erythrocyte sedimentation rate', 'C-reactive protein', 'incubation cultures of the pus and the tissue', 'Columbia blood agar', 'Colonial characteristics, physiological properties and biochemical tests', 'antibiotics', 'MICs', 'E-test', 'cephalosporins', 'antimicrobial therapy', 'therapy', 'treatment', 'laboratory tests', 'antibiotic therapy']","['Four days after his admission', 'Four days after his admission', 'Four days after his admission', 'Four days after his admission', 'Four days after his admission', 'Three days later', '6 months later']"
54,535354-1,15555068,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC535354.xml,Supracubital perineurioma misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome: case report,"Three years after a cubital procaine-HCL 0.05% injection had caused acute severe local pain radiating to his forearm and wrist, a 33-year old man complained about pain in his right hand. Two months later, he also suffered from numbness in the distribution of the right median nerve and wasting of thenar muscles. Furthermore a muscular atrophy in his right forearm was noted. Nerve conduction studies showed an increased distal latency in the median nerve, a very low thenar compound muscle action potential on median nerve stimulation, a reduced sensory conduction velocity of 39 m/s in the median nerve on thumb stimulation and no sensory nerve action potential on stimulation of the 2nd and 3rd fingers. Electromyography of the right biceps brachii muscle was normal. In the fibrillations, an increased duration and amplitude of motor unit potentials and reduced recruitment pattern were found in the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. Forearm muscles were not investigated. A carpal tunnel syndrome was diagnosed and treated by surgery.
Ten months later the patient was admitted to our department because of persistence of his symptoms. Nerve conduction studies showed no response over the thenar muscle on median nerve stimulation at the wrist and elbow. Fibrillations and sparse motor unit potentials with increased duration and amplitude (up to 10 mV) were found in flexor digitorum superficialis muscle, in contrast to the normal Electromyography-findings of the right flexor carpi ulnaris. On median nerve stimulation at the elbow a low compound muscle action potential with an increased distal latency was recorded over flexor digitorum superficialis muscle in the right side (right: amplitude 1 mV, latency 9.0 ms, left: amplitude 7 mV, latency 3.2 ms). No sensory nerve action potential was recorded at the wrist on stimulation of the 1st, 2nd or 3rd finger. Somatosensory evoked potentials of the left median and right radial and ulnar nerve were normal. No potential was recorded at Erb's point in the supraclavicular fossa, at the sixth and second cervical vertebra and the contralateral cortex on median nerve stimulation on the right.
Proximal median nerve lesion was suggested. Palpation along the median nerve revealed a fusiform mass at the distal third of the right upper arm, which could be confirmed by MRI (see figure and ).
Surgical resection of a 7 cm long segment of the median nerve with the tumorous lesion and replacement with a sural nerve graft was undertaken. Resection was necessary because of severe involvement of fascicles without any possibility to separate the tumour from the median nerve by micro-surgery. Histological investigation revealed marked peri- and endoneurial fibrosis, severe axonal loss as well as proliferation of concentric whorl-like formations resulting in multicompartment arrangement. These pseudo onion-bulb formations showed strong immunoreactivity for the epithelial membrane antigen and were predominantly negative for S-100 protein, suggesting a proliferation of perineurial cells rather than Schwann cells. In addition, small groups of regenerating axonal sprouts surrounded by perineurial ensheathment were visible, indicating some neuroma-like component (see figure and ).
The tumour was diagnosed as perineurioma and additional neuroma by histopathology. On clinical follow-up four years later a partial recovery of forearm muscle strength could be noted and the patient was free from pain.","[[33.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['forearm', 'wrist', 'right hand', 'distribution of the right median nerve', 'right median nerve', 'thenar muscles', 'muscular', 'right forearm', 'Nerve', 'median nerve', 'thenar compound muscle', 'median nerve', 'median nerve', 'thumb', 'sensory nerve', '2nd and 3rd fingers', 'right biceps brachii muscle', 'right abductor pollicis brevis muscle', 'Forearm muscles', 'carpal tunnel', 'Nerve', 'thenar muscle', 'median nerve', 'wrist', 'elbow', 'flexor digitorum superficialis', 'flexor digitorum superficialis muscle', 'right flexor carpi ulnaris', 'median nerve', 'elbow', 'muscle', 'flexor digitorum superficialis muscle', 'sensory nerve', 'wrist', '1st, 2nd or 3rd finger', 'left median', 'right radial', 'ulnar nerve', ""Erb's point in the supraclavicular fossa"", 'sixth and second cervical vertebra', 'contralateral cortex', 'median nerve', 'Proximal median nerve', 'median nerve', 'distal third of the right upper arm', 'segment of the median nerve', 'fascicles', 'median nerve', 'peri- and endoneurial', 'axonal', 'epithelial membrane', 'perineurial cells', 'axonal', 'perineurial', 'forearm muscle']","['local pain', 'pain', 'numbness', 'wasting of thenar muscles', 'muscular atrophy', 'distal latency', 'thenar compound muscle action potential', 'sensory nerve action potential', 'fibrillations', 'motor unit potentials', 'carpal tunnel syndrome', 'symptoms', 'response over the thenar muscle', 'Fibrillations', 'sparse motor unit potentials', 'increased duration and amplitude', 'normal Electromyography-findings of the right flexor carpi ulnaris', 'low compound muscle action potential', 'increased distal latency', 'distal latency', 'sensory nerve action potential', 'Somatosensory evoked potentials of the left median and right radial and ulnar nerve were normal', 'potential', 'Proximal median nerve lesion', 'Palpation along the median nerve', 'fusiform mass', 'tumorous lesion', 'lesion', 'involvement of fascicles', 'tumour', 'peri- and endoneurial fibrosis', 'axonal loss', 'proliferation of concentric whorl-like formations', 'multicompartment arrangement', 'pseudo onion-bulb formations', 'strong immunoreactivity for the epithelial membrane antigen', 'immunoreactivity', 'proliferation of perineurial cells', 'Schwann cells', 'regenerating axonal sprouts', 'perineurial ensheathment', 'neuroma-like component', 'tumour', 'perineurioma', 'neuroma', 'forearm muscle strength', 'pain']",['procaine-HCL'],['33-year'],"['Nerve conduction studies', 'sensory conduction velocity', 'Electromyography of the right biceps brachii muscle', 'surgery', 'Nerve conduction studies', 'median nerve stimulation', 'Electromyography-findings of the right flexor carpi ulnaris', 'median nerve stimulation at the elbow', 'amplitude', 'latency', 'amplitude', 'latency', 'median nerve stimulation', 'MRI', 'Surgical resection of a 7 cm long segment of the median nerve with the tumorous lesion and replacement with a sural nerve graft', 'Resection', 'separate the tumour from the median nerve by micro-surgery', 'Histological', 'epithelial membrane antigen', 'S-100 protein', 'histopathology']","['Three years', 'Two months later', 'Ten months later', 'four years later']"
55,535544-1,15541184,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC535544.xml,Large bilateral adrenal metastases in non-small cell lung cancer,"A 59-year-old male, working in a quarry, was admitted to the hospital complaining of abdominal pain persisting for 45 days, afternoon fever, fatigue and 8 kg weight loss during the last month. Previous medical history was non contributory. He was a heavy smoker for 45 years.
At first assessment, the patient presented with disseminated dry rales and decrease of vesicular murmur in the right upper lung field. Following abdominal examination, palpable smooth surface masses were discovered in both renal areas. Laboratory tests demonstrated a significant anemia with normocytic features (hematocrit 24%, Hb 7.2 mg/dl).
Chest X-ray revealed a consolidated area in the right upper lobe of the lung. Abdomen ultrasound demonstrated large masses with foci of hemorrhagic necrosis in both adrenal glands (Figure ).
Computed tomographic (CT) -scan revealed an invasive process in the right upper lobe of the lung (Figure ) and large masses of heterogeneous texture, with hemorrhagic and necrotic elements within both adrenal glands (Figure ).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed which showed the masses with disseminated foci of high, heterogeneous signal intensity and pathologic enhancement after intravenous (i.v.) administration of contrast agent in both T1 and T2 weighted sequences. Radiological features were suggestive of adrenal metastasis from lung primary (Figures , ). Histological examination of the biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis of a large-cell carcinoma of the lung. The patient showed significant deterioration and was hospitalized again for altered level of consciousness, blurring of vision, tinnitus, lability and intense fatigue. Laboratory examination demonstrated severe leukocytosis with 98,000 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, compatible with the leukemoid reaction within the framework of a paraneoplastic syndrome. Hematocrit (Ht) levels dropped significantly a second time (Ht: 21%, Hb: 6.9 mg/dl), the biochemical parameters were normal, while the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test excluded the possibility of cortical adrenal failure (serum cortisol basal value: 9μg/dl and 34μg/dl six hours following intramuscular (i.m.) administration of 1 mg of ACTH). A repeat abdominal ultrasound revealed numerous hemorrhagic elements inside the adrenal masses. The patient received urgent chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin, with simultaneous supportive treatment. Following chemotherapy, leukocytes decreased progressively, while symptoms related to the central nervous system (CNS) improved, however, the patient died suddenly on the fifth day following chemotherapy. Autopsy was not performed. The physician's on-call medical report documented a typical cardiac arrest, without evidence of acute hemorrhage in adrenal mass.","[[59.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['abdominal', 'vesicular', 'right upper lung field', 'abdominal', 'both renal areas', 'Chest', 'right upper lobe of the lung', 'Abdomen', 'both adrenal glands', 'right upper lobe of the lung', 'both adrenal glands', 'adrenal', 'lung', 'lung', 'cortical adrenal', 'abdominal', 'adrenal', 'central nervous system', 'CNS', 'cardiac', 'adrenal']","['abdominal pain', 'fever', 'fatigue', 'weight loss', 'smoker', 'rales', 'vesicular murmur', 'masses', 'anemia', 'normocytic features', 'consolidated area', 'masses', 'foci of hemorrhagic necrosis', 'invasive process', 'masses of heterogeneous texture', 'hemorrhagic', 'necrotic elements', 'masses', 'disseminated foci', 'heterogeneous signal intensity', 'pathologic enhancement', 'adrenal metastasis', 'large-cell carcinoma of the lung', 'deterioration', 'altered level of consciousness', 'blurring of vision', 'tinnitus', 'lability', 'fatigue', 'leukocytosis', 'leukemoid reaction', 'paraneoplastic syndrome', 'cortical adrenal failure', 'hemorrhagic elements inside the adrenal masses', 'symptoms', 'died', 'cardiac arrest', 'hemorrhage', 'adrenal mass']","['ACTH', 'paclitaxel', 'carboplatin']","['59', 'quarry']","['Laboratory tests', 'hematocrit', 'Hb', 'Chest X-ray', 'Abdomen ultrasound', 'Computed tomographic (CT) -scan', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'Histological examination', 'biopsy specimen', 'Laboratory examination', 'polymorphonuclear leukocytes', 'Hematocrit (Ht) levels', 'Ht', 'Ht', 'Hb', 'biochemical parameters', 'adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test', 'serum cortisol basal value', 'abdominal ultrasound', 'chemotherapy', 'supportive treatment', 'chemotherapy', 'leukocytes', 'chemotherapy', 'Autopsy']","['45 days', 'afternoon', 'last month', '45 years', 'fifth day']"

Her past medical history was significant for colonic adenocarcinoma treated surgically, twelve years prior. The skin overlying the 2 × 3 cm firm, non-fluctuant, non-tender mass was erythematous. Initially the mass was thought to be a boil or carbuncle. Six weeks later during a visit with a surgical oncologist for routine follow-up of her colonic adenocarcinoma resected 13 years prior, the patient noted that the mass was becoming quite painful and enlarging rapidly. The patient was then taken to the OR for local excision. Pathology revealed a small round blue cell tumor forming large nests and infiltrating as single cells between thick strands of fibrous tissue in the dermis and extending to the subcutaneous fat. There were abundant mitoses, a lack of necrosis or obvious vascular invasion. The epidermis was uninvolved. The histologic and immunochemical findings supported the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma. A wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. One sentinel lymph node was negative for malignancy and there was no residual tumor identified in the excision. No adjuvant therapy was given.
Ten months after the initial presentation the patient had increasing shoulder pain that radiated into the chest and flank. A CT of the thoracic spine revealed a 3.0 cm mass in the area of the fourth thoracic (T4) vertebra. A CT guided needle biopsy of the area revealed metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. A bone scan revealed additional areas of concern in the right humerus and bilateral distal femurs. The patient received radiation therapy to the thoracic spine and right distal femur for palliation of bone pain.
A year after first presenting for a right buttock mass, the patient was admitted to the hospital for increasing dyspnea. A chest radiograph revealed a large right pleural effusion, which was drained for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. The fluid was grossly bloody and cytology revealed abundant, round, basophilic single cells, many in mitosis, with characteristic granular, ""salt and pepper"" nuclear chromatin (Figure ).

There was no history of preceding trauma or accident. Two years after initiation of symptoms without clinical progress, the patient became pregnant and noted a local growth of the mass. After giving birth to a healthy child, the patient consulted an orthopedic surgeon. A radiographic image of the pelvis revealed a large osteolytic lesion in the left iliac wing, sharply contoured with sclerotic margins, indicating a slow growth pattern (Figure ). MR-imaging of the pelvis showed a mass originating from the os ilium with a large extra- and intrapelvic soft-tissue component (Figure ). Open biopsy was performed that lead to the diagnosis of BFH.
After reference to the literature on BFH, surgical en bloc resection was considered to be the appropriate treatment modality [,,,]. In accordance to the imaging results, the iliac crest could be preserved, while the linea terminalis of the left side had to be resected (Figure ). Figure shows the resected tumor specimen. Histological study of the resected specimen confirmed the diagnosis of BFH (Figure ). The surgical margins were found to be free of tumor confirming complete tumor resection.
The pelvic ring was then stabilized in a second operation using a non-vascularized fibular autograft that was impacted and stabilized with screws and a Kirschner-wire reconstructing the linea terminalis of the left pelvic ring (Figure ).

She had a history of arterial hypertension and cholecystectomy two years previously. On examination she had tenderness of the upper abdomen. Blood tests showed leucocytosis (14,500 / mm3), increased serum levels of amylase (1,100 IU/L), LDH (550 IU/L) and calcium (14.8 mg/dl). On ultrasonography of the upper abdomen a non homogeneous appearance of the head of the pancreas was noted with a common bile duct diameter of 8.5 mm. CT scan of the abdomen confirmed the diagnosis of acute exudative pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis subsided within 72 hours after conservative treatment. Further laboratory investigation of the hypercalcaemia revealed increased 24-hours urine calcium (465 mg), decreased serum phosphorus levels at 1.3 mg/dl, increased serum parathyroid hormone levels (771 pg/ml), normal levels of serum free T3 (FT3), free T4 (FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), calcitonine, carcino embryonic antigen (CEA), carcinoma antigen (CA) 15-9, CA 125, alpha feto protein (AFP). Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland and the neck showed a suspicious prevertebral mass. CT scan of the thorax and neck detected a paraesophageal mediastinal mass close to the thoracic inlet. (Figure ) 99mTc sestamibi scintigraphy confirmed the diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma. (Figure ).
After the complete subsidence of acute pancreatitis and the return of calcium serum levels at values less than 12 g/dl by hydration, the patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) which failed to show bile duct lithiasis. With a diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma, resection of the parathyroid adenoma via a collar cervical incision was carried out. The tumor was easily separated from the surrounded structures (vertebra, trachea, and esophagus) by blunt dissection and the feeding vessels were found and ligated anteriorly. (Figure ) The patient had a 6 days uneventful hospital stay. Calcium and parathyroid hormone serum levels returned to normal within 48 hours from the end of operation.

62,539240-1,15585066,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC539240.xml,Pancreatic metastasis from gastric carcinoma: a case report,"A 60-year-old woman presented with elevated blood levels of the tumor markers CEA (17.3 μg/L, normal <2.5 μg/L) and CA 19-9 (121 U/ml, normal <37 U/ml). Four years before being referred to our institution, the patient had undergone gastric resection (Billroth II gastrectomy) for an adenocarcinoma of the stomach. The tumor was located at the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum, measuring 3 cm in the largest diameter. Pathologic examination revealed a gastric carcinoma of low differentiation, which infiltrated the gastric wall into the subserosal layer without penetrating the serosa. Microscopically, the carcinoma was mainly composed of tubular formations of mitotically active, atypical epithelial cells (Figure ). The tumor also displayed areas of marked desmoplastic stromal reaction, as well as areas of rather glandular differentiation. The latter two were mainly observed in paragastric lymph node metastases (Figure ). The carcinoma at stage pT2 pN1 (6/15) M0 G2 was completely resected (R0 resection). No recurrence was detected during the regular follow-ups.
Four years after gastric resection, however, ultrasound examination, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an inhomogeneous mass of the pancreatic head, measuring 4 cm in largest diameter (Figure ). Radiographically, no other masses were detected. For differential diagnosis, a primary carcinoma of the pancreas and a metastasis of the gastric carcinoma were considered. Following explorative laparotomy, the pancreatic mass was resected performing a partial pancreatoduodenectomy with resection of the distal bile duct (Whipple's procedure). Furthermore, the former gastroenterostomy was resected and revised. On pathologic examination, the tumor of the pancreatic head grossly presented as white to yellowish, firm mass. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of solid and glandular formations of atypical epithelial cells with distinct nuclear pleomorphism and presented marked desmoplastic stromal reaction, as well as areas of necrosis (Figure ). The duodenal wall and the peripancreatic tissue were infiltrated by the tumor. Lymph node metastases were detected in two peripancreatic lymph nodes. The histomorphological appearance of the pancreatic tumor was in good accordance to some areas of the primary gastric tumor, and especially the growth pattern found in the paragastric lymph node metastases coped well with the microscopic picture found in the pancreatic tumor. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed identical expression patterns in the gastric carcinoma and the pancreatic mass, both displaying positive reactions with antibodies towards cytokeratins 8, 18 and 19, as well as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), whereas no reactions were seen with antibodies towards cytokeratins 7 and 20. Because of these findings and due to the lack of pancreatic cancer progenitor lesions, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), within the non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue of the Whipple's resection specimen, the pancreatic tumor and the two regional lymph node metastases were considered to be metastases of the primary gastric carcinoma.
The patient was discharged from the hospital without any perioperative morbidity on the ninth postoperative day. The postoperative blood levels of the tumor markers declined to normal values (CEA 2.6 μg/l, CA 19-9 24 U/ml). Due to the complete surgical resection and the lack of risk factors for recurrence, the patient received no further adjuvant therapy. Under regular follow-up for one year with determination of the tumor markers and computed tomography, the patient revealed no signs or symptoms of local or systemic recurrence.","[[60.0, 'year']]",F,2004,"['gastric', 'stomach', 'lesser curvature of the gastric antrum', 'gastric', 'gastric', 'gastric wall', 'subserosal layer', 'serosa', 'glandular', 'paragastric lymph node', 'M0 G2', 'R0', 'gastric', 'pancreatic head', 'pancreas', 'gastric', 'pancreatic', 'distal bile duct', 'pancreatic head', 'duodenal wall', 'peripancreatic tissue', 'Lymph node', 'two peripancreatic lymph nodes', 'pancreatic', 'gastric', 'paragastric lymph node', 'paragastric lymph node metastases', 'pancreatic', 'gastric', 'pancreatic', 'pancreatic', 'pancreatic intraepithelial', 'pancreatic tissue', 'pancreatic', 'regional lymph node', 'gastric']","['elevated blood levels of the tumor markers', 'adenocarcinoma of the stomach', 'tumor', 'gastric carcinoma', 'infiltrated the gastric wall into the subserosal layer', 'penetrating the serosa', 'carcinoma', 'atypical epithelial cells', 'tumor', 'desmoplastic stromal reaction', 'glandular differentiation', 'paragastric lymph node metastases', 'carcinoma', 'recurrence', 'inhomogeneous mass of the pancreatic head', 'masses', 'primary carcinoma of the pancreas', 'metastasis of the gastric carcinoma', 'pancreatic mass', 'tumor of the pancreatic head', 'mass', 'tumor', 'nuclear pleomorphism', 'desmoplastic stromal reaction', 'necrosis', 'infiltrated by the tumor', 'Lymph node metastases', 'pancreatic tumor', 'gastric tumor', 'growth pattern', 'paragastric lymph node metastases', 'pancreatic tumor', 'gastric carcinoma', 'pancreatic mass', 'reactions', 'pancreatic cancer progenitor lesions', 'pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias', 'PanINs', 'non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue', 'pancreatic tumor', 'regional lymph node metastases', 'metastases of the primary gastric carcinoma', 'morbidity', 'local or systemic recurrence']",[],"['60', '6/15']","['blood levels of the tumor markers', 'CEA', 'CA 19-9', 'gastric resection', 'Billroth II gastrectomy', 'Pathologic examination', 'Microscopically', 'completely resected', 'R0 resection', 'gastric resection', 'ultrasound examination', 'computed tomography', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'Radiographically', 'explorative laparotomy', 'pancreatic mass was resected', 'partial pancreatoduodenectomy', 'resection of the distal bile duct', ""Whipple's procedure"", 'gastroenterostomy was resected', 'pathologic examination', 'Microscopically', 'microscopic picture', 'Immunohistochemical analyses', 'antibodies towards cytokeratins 8, 18 and 19', 'carcinoembryonic antigen', 'carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)', 'CEA', 'antibodies towards cytokeratins 7 and 20', ""Whipple's resection specimen"", 'blood levels of the tumor markers', 'CEA', 'CA', 'surgical resection', 'adjuvant therapy', 'tumor markers', 'computed tomography']","['Four years', 'perioperative', 'ninth postoperative day', 'postoperative']"

Although we have included her case in our previous publication [], we have not reported her clinical details at that time. She was put on prednisolone 30 mg and azathioprine 100 mg daily since end of June and mid-July 2002, respectively. She was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital on 11th August 2002 for investigation of jaundice. Investigations revealed deranged liver function tests with cholestatic pattern. A diagnosis of drug-induced hepatotoxicity was entertained, and azathioprine was stopped after admission. As her autoimmune disease was under control, her steroid dosage was reduced from 25 mg to 15 mg daily within the next 14 days. Her CXR taken on admission was normal.
Soon after her immunosuppressive therapy was tapered, she developed fever and non-productive cough. A repeat CXR performed on 9th Sept revealed new infiltrate over the left mid-zone, suggestive of pneumonia. She was started on intravenous ceftazidime 1 gram eight hourly and oral clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily. Serial CXR performed three days later showed increasing bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and worsening hypoxemia.

He was treated with steroid and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily since 1997. He had a flare up of disease in May 1998 with active vasculitis and myositis, for which he was put on prednisolone and azthioprine 50 mg and 100 mg daily respectively. Upon reassessment one month later, disease activity was under control, and the dosage of prednisolone was reduced to 45 mg daily.
Twelve day after reducing the immunosuppressive regimen, he was admitted to hospital for treatment of left buttock abscess. The CXR taken on admission was unremarkable. An aspirate of the pus from the lesion grew methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus; he was treated with cloxacillin 1 g intravenously every 6 hourly, together with incision and drainage of the buttock abscess. In view of the underlying active pyogenic infection, the steroid dosage was rapidly tapered from 45 mg to 15 mg daily within the next four days. However, he was noted to have persistent fever associated with mild unproductive cough. A repeat chest radiograph showed new infiltrates over the right upper and left lower zones, and he was empirically treated with intravenous ceftazidime 1 gram every 8 hours, cloxacillin 1 gram every 6 hours and netimicin 100 mg every 8 hours. As there was no clinical response after 5 days of treatment, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, which was positive for Pneumocystis jiroveci. Investigation for the presence of co-existing opportunistic pathogens such as cytomegalovirus and aspergillus was negative. On the day after bronchoscopy, he was commenced on intravenous cotrimoxazole 1.3 grams every 6 hours. He remained stable initially with fever on downward trend. However, on the 3rd day of treatment, he developed sudden desaturation with resurgence of high fever, and required supplemental oxygen therapy. Repeat chest radiograph showed increased perihilar hazziness in both lung fields. There was also an upsurge of total lymphocyte count from 0.6 × 109/L (total white cell count 11.2 × 109/L) on admission, to 1.3 × 109/L (total white cell count 10.4 × 109/L) at the time of clinical deterioration. He was treated with high dose prednisolone (80 mg daily), and his condition improved promptly afterwards. He was subsequently discharged, and on follow up at the clinic one month later, his total lymphocyte count had returned to his baseline level of 0.6 × 109/L.
Immunorestitution disease (IRD) has been described in both HIV and non-HIV immunosuppressed hosts previously [-]. In the setting of PCP, it is defined as an acute symptomatic presentation of the disease that is related temporally to the recovery of the immune system, associated with reversal of immunosuppressive processes such as reduction in the dosage of corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic agents or a reduction of HIV viral load due to HAART, which results in the development of immunopathological damage. The preexisting microbial infection could be either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Using this case definition, we attempted to review the English literature for other reported cases of PCP manifesting as IRD. The English-language literature (1966 – 2003) was searched in the Medline database of the National Library of Medicine in October 2003. The keywords ""Pneumocystis carinii"", ""Pneumocystis jiroveci"", ""HIV"", immunosuppression"", ""immunosuppressive"", ""steroid"", and ""corticosteroid"" were used to select cases. All the case reports and case series with clinical details were included in this study if they fulfilled the above definition of IRD. When appropriate, the cited bibliographies were also retrieved for further analysis. As for statistical analysis, we used the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, a non-parametric test for comparing paired samples, to analyze the serial changes in lymphocyte counts and HIV viral loads before and during the development of IRD. A two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.5 for Windows.
Including our present case, a total of 29 cases of PCP in non-HIV immunosuppressed hosts fulfilling our definition of IRD have been reported in the literature (table ) [-,]. There were altogether 13 males and 8 females, with a median age of 38 years (range 2 to 75 years). The age and sex were not mentioned in 8 cases. Their underlying immunosuppressive conditions included solid organ tumours (13 cases), haematological diseases (8), autoimmune diseases (4), endogenous Cushing's disease (3), and a solid organ transplant recipient (1). All patients had received steroids or had excessive endogenous steroid production, whereas 18 (62.1%) of them had concomitant cytotoxic therapy for the underlying diseases. The median duration between steroid tapering and clinical manifestations of PCP was 21 days (range 1 to 83 days). Steroids were completely withdrawn at a median of 7.5 days (range 1 to 21 days) before the onset of symptoms in eight patients. Serial lymphocyte counts were only available in eight patients. An upsurge of the absolute lymphocyte counts was observed from the time of reduction of immunosuppression (median 300/μL, range 290 to 600/μL at baseline) to the time of occurrence of IRD (median 1200/μL, range 600 to 5620/μL); the median increase in total lymphocyte count was 800/μL, with a range of 300 to 4880/μL. Comparing the lymphocyte counts before and after reversal of immunosuppressive therapy, the difference was statistically significant (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for paired samples; p = 0.012). In addition to our patient, reintroduction or increasing doses of steroids were required in 7 (53.8%) of 13 patients in the acute management of PCP in the literature, at the time when they developed clinical deterioration during antimicrobial therapy [-]. Seven (53.8%) of 13 cases had respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Among these 29 cases, 13 (44.8%) subsequently died of PCP.
Among HIV-positive patients, 13 cases with newly diagnosed PCP were reported in the literature, in which IRD occurred shortly after the introduction of HAART (table ) [-]. Seven (53.8%) out of 13 cases received steroids as adjunctive therapy in addition to antimicrobials. HAART was given in all cases at a median 18 days (range 1 to 35 days) after the initiation of treatment for PCP. During IRD, recurrence of fever (100%), dyspnoea (100%), and paradoxical worsening of pulmonary infiltrates (58.3%) were observed in these patients [-]. IRD occurred at a median of 14 days (range 5 to 17 days) after HAART. An upsurge of the CD4 lymphocyte count was observed before (median 28/μL, range 4 to 290/μL) and during IRD (median 125/μL, range 30 to 564/μL); this was associated with a concomitant reduction of the median HIV viral load from 5.5 log10 copies/ml (range 5.0 to 5.9 log10 copies/ml) to 3.1 log10 copies/ml (range 2.9 to 4.5 log10 copies/ml) before and during IRD respectively, and the differences observed in both the CD4 counts and viral loads before and during IRD reached statistical significance (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for related samples; p = 0.001 and 0.017, respectively). Antimicrobials, steroids, or both for PCP were reintroduced for IRD in 4, 1, and 6 cases respectively. Only 2 cases were treated conservatively. One case required mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory distress. None of the patients died.
PCP manifesting as a form of IRD is not a rare phenomenon. As shown in our previous study, it happens in 7 out of 10 (70%) of HIV-negative immunosuppressed hosts infected with Pj []. However, the diagnosis of PCP is usually delayed in this group of patients because of atypical presentation. In this clinical setting, PCP manifesting as IRD often runs an acute and fulminant course, with nonspecific lesions on chest radiographs, and high absolute lymphocyte counts []. In our own reported series, despite the administration of steroid therapy to suppress the immunopathological damage, more than 80% of patients developed acute respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. Patients who developed PCP during reversal of immunosuppressive therapy in our series tended to be older, and this might partially explain the increased mortality observed in this group [].
Rapid reduction of immunosuppressive therapy such as steroids has been implicated as a predisposing factor for the development of PCP in HIV-negative patients [,,,]. In one study, PCP occurred in 79 (70%) of 113 patients during steroid tapering []. Another study suggested that 8 (72.2%) out of 11 episodes of PCP developed when steroid therapy was tapered []. A subsequent study also demonstrated that 43% of patients had a rapid reduction of steroid dosing before the clinical manifestations of PCP []. A similar experience was reported in children, and 17 (89.5%) out of 19 children were diagnosed to have PCP during steroid tapering according to a previous report []. Another series revealed that 7 of 11 patients experienced acutely symptomatic PCP when the dose of steroids was decreased or terminated 5 days to 3 weeks before the diagnosis of PCP []. However, all these cases were not analyzed from a perspective of IRD. Serial changes of the absolute lymphocyte counts or their subsets were either not noted or reported [,,-]. Hence we have not included these cases for further analysis in this review.
Among HIV positive patients, PCP manifesting acutely during the initiation anti-retroviral therapy is a well-recognized phenomenon. The underlying immunopathological nature of this condition, which is reminiscent to IRD occurring in non-HIV infected patients, has been confirmed by histological examination of the lungs and transbronchial biopsy specimens, which demonstrated mixed inflammatory infiltrates including macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Almost all infiltrating lymphocytes found in the tissues were of the T cell lineage, shown by immunophenotyping to be predominantly CD4 and CD8 cells []. In another study [], the BAL fluid obtained from one of six patients with an IRD-type presentation of PCP was analyzed. Infiltration of predominantly CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes with the proliferative marker (Ki67) and perforin-positive cell were seen in the BAL specimen. Therefore, it is likely that the phagocytosed Pj is presented by alveolar macrophage to T cells, which trigger the inflammatory response [].
In our own experience, as well as from the review of published literature, it appears that a surge of absolute lymphocyte count, especially the CD4 lymphocyte count in HIV-positive patients, could potentially act as a surrogate marker for immunopathological damage during IRD in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients. In our recent publication [], 7 out of 10 non-HIV immunosuppressed patients demonstrated a consistent rise in the absolute lymphocyte count during tapering of immunosuppression prior to the onset of symptomatic PCP. In this group of patients, the surge in lymphocyte count is likely the result of withdrawal of lymphocytotoxic immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids. Similarly, a rising trend of the CD4 lymphocyte count, consistent with immune reconstitution after HAART, was also observed in 13 HIV-positive cases before and during the development of symptomatic PCP [-]. In fact, an upsurge in the absolute lymphocyte count has been shown to be a marker of IRD in our previous publications involving viral and tuberculous infections [-]. However, it must be emphasized that the number of circulating lymphocytes may not always correlate with their number in the affected tissues or their in vivo functional activity. This can be exemplified by a case of PCP occurring during steroid withdrawal, in which the lymphocyte counts surged to a very high level and then rapidly dropped to a low level within one day. The migration of lymphocytes from the circulation to tissue might explain this rapid drop in lymphocyte count and the resulting immunopathological damage []. In the future, further studies on lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profiles of susceptible hosts during the development of IRD should be performed to elucidate the underlying immunopathological mechanisms behind this interesting phenomenon.
From the result of this review, it appears that HIV-positive patients with PCP are at risk of clinical deterioration due to IRD if HAART therapy is started within 1 to 2 weeks after the initiation of treatment for PCP (table ). With a better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms resulting in IRD, we may be able to prevent the occurrence of IRD by delaying the initiation of HAART in HIV-positive patients with PCP. However, in non-HIV immunosuppressed patients, it is even more important to recognize the atypical presentations of PCP in the context of IRD. Since the clinical and/or radiological features alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis, analysis of serial changes in lymphocyte counts in patients undergoing a reduction of immunosuppression can alert the clinician to the possibility of IRD due to occult pathogens such as Pj. To prevent IRD in non-HIV immunosuppressed patients, the use of prophylactic antibiotics against Pj to reduce the microbial load in selected patients remains an important issue. Recently, a multi-center study showed that the CD4 lymphocyte count may be a useful marker to monitor the risk of development of PCP in non-HIV immunosuppressed hosts [], and patients with low CD4 lymphocyte counts of less than 300 or 400 may require prophylaxis. In fact, asymptomatic colonization of Pj has been demonstrated in HIV-negative patients when the CD4 lymphocyte count was less than 400 []. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified a significant percentage of clinically silent Pj colonization in 20% of non-HIV immunosuppressed patients []. Therefore, early detection of asymptomatic infection of Pj in blood and respiratory specimens before, and during intense immunosuppression may enable selection of cases for pre-emptive treatment of Pj infection in order to prevent the development of IRD during reversal of immunosuppression [,].","[[33.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['left buttock', 'buttock', 'chest', 'right upper and left lower zones',

65,539248-1,15581427,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC539248.xml,Successful obstetrical management of 110-day intertwin delivery interval without cerclage: counseling and conservative management approach to extreme asynchronous twin birth,"A 30 year-old non-smoking Caucasian G3P1011 presented for initial prenatal assessment at six weeks gestation. The conception was established without medical assistance. The patient had no significant medical or surgical history. She underwent an uncomplicated curettage for missed abortion four years before presentation and an uneventful term vaginal delivery occurred two years later.
Transvaginal ultrasound at seven weeks gestation revealed a dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy. At 18 weeks gestation no growth discordance was noted, but cervical length was two cm with funneling. Based on these findings, the patient was counseled about maternal and neonatal risks associated with twin pregnancy, particularly the risk of preterm labor due to cervical shortening. Although rescue cerclage was offered to the patient, this option was declined. She was therefore placed on bedrest for two weeks with follow-up ultrasonography for assessment of cervical length.
At 192/7 weeks gestation the patient experienced abdominal cramping and non-purulent blood-tinged vaginal discharge. The patient remained afebrile. She was hospitalized and placed on bed rest in Trendelenburg position after sterile speculum exam found the cervix two cm dilated with protruding ""hourglass membranes"".
One day later, amniotic membranes had fully retracted and were no longer visible above a closed cervix. Microscopic examination of vaginal fluid found occasional clue cells. External monitoring identified occasional uterine contractions; heart rates at ~150/min were measured for both twins. The patient was again counseled about the implications of preterm labor at this early stage, and the uncertainty of preventing further cervical dilation. After consideration of all therapeutic options (including cerclage), the patient elected tocolysis with a view to save her pregnancy. A 4 g loading dose of magnesium sulfate was administered intravenously, followed by a maintenance dose of 2 g/h. Oral metronidazole (500 mg) was given every 8 h, and 500 mg ampicillin was given intravenously every 6 h after a 2 gm loading dose according to hospital protocol. Additionally, oral indomethacin (50 mg) was given every 6 h for 3 days. Just as the magnesium sulfate was initiated, the patient experienced spontaneous rupture of membranes and prolapse of umbilical cord of twin A was noted several hours later. Fetal demise was confirmed approximately 1 h later, but there was no evidence of labor or infection over the next 24 h. After discussing the potential dangers of prolonged rupture of membranes, retention of dead fetus, maternal sepsis, the potential for prolonged hospitalization, need for hysterectomy and risk of death, the patient elected to continue limited oxytocin augmentation in an attempt to deliver twin A and salvage twin B. The risk of losing both fetuses was carefully discussed, and the patient agreed with this management approach despite the acknowledged uncertainty of outcome.
After 8 h of oxytocin therapy, a stillborn female fetus (319 g) was delivered. The placenta remained in situ and the umbilical cord of twin A was divided and ligated near the cervix with 3-0 chromic gut suture. Oxytocin was immediately discontinued. Monitoring of twin B confirmed stable heart tones and appropriate fetal movement throughout delivery of the non-viable twin. Intravenous ampicillin and metronidazole were continued postpartum but MgSO4 was not reinitiated. Immediately following delivery of twin A, sterile speculum exam found a closed cervix with the umbilical cord completely retracted in utero. Maternal vital signs remained stable and she was discharged home one week later on full bed rest, preterm labor precautions, and oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (875 mg) twice daily × 5 d.
At 25 weeks gestation, 12 mg betamethasone was administered intramuscularly with an additional dose 24 h later. There was no evidence of infection or coagulopathy at biweekly clinical evaluations, which included serial ultrasounds until 34 weeks to assess cervical length. Formal biophysical profiles (BPP) began at 28 weeks, when the estimated fetal weight was 1250 g and the BPP score was 8/8. At this time mild uterine irritability was detected and 5 mg oral terbutaline was given every 4 h until 34 weeks. Uterine activity was reduced following oral terbutaline therapy.
Spontaneous labor began at 35 1/7 weeks. At readmission, the cervix was 5 cm dilated with intact membranes and vertex presentation. Epidural anesthesia was established, an amniotomy was performed, and the patient had a normal progress of labor. She delivered a viable male infant weighting 2894 g (1 and 5 min Apgar 9 and 9, respectively) over an intact perineum. Approximately 5 min later, two placentas were delivered spontaneously (Figure ). The postpartum course was uncomplicated; mother and baby were discharged home in stable condition 48 h later.","[[30.0, 'year']]",F,2004,"['vaginal', 'Transvaginal', 'cervical', 'cervical', 'cervical', 'abdominal', 'vaginal', 'cervix', 'amniotic membranes', 'cervix', 'vaginal', 'uterine', 'heart', 'cervical', 'membranes', 'umbilical cord of twin A', 'membranes', 'placenta', 'umbilical cord of twin A', 'cervix', 'heart', 'cervix', 'umbilical cord', 'utero', 'cervical', 'uterine', 'Uterine', 'cervix', 'membranes', 'vertex', 'perineum', 'placentas']","['non-smoking', 'G3P1011', 'gestation', 'missed abortion', 'uneventful term vaginal delivery', 'gestation', 'dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy', 'gestation', 'growth discordance', 'cervical length was two cm', 'funneling', 'maternal and neonatal risks', 'twin pregnancy', 'preterm labor', 'cervical shortening', 'gestation', 'abdominal cramping', 'vaginal discharge', 'afebrile', 'dilated', 'retracted', 'longer visible above a closed cervix', 'vaginal fluid', 'clue cells', 'uterine contractions', 'preterm labor', 'cervical dilation', 'pregnancy', 'rupture of membranes', 'prolapse of umbilical cord of twin A', 'Fetal demise', 'labor', 'infection', 'rupture of membranes', 'retention of dead fetus', 'maternal sepsis', 'death', 'deliver twin A and salvage twin B.', 'losing both fetuses', 'stillborn female fetus', 'placenta remained in situ', 'stable heart tones', 'appropriate fetal movement', 'delivery of the non-viable twin', 'delivery of twin A', 'closed cervix', 'retracted', 'retracted in utero', 'gestation', 'infection', 'coagulopathy', 'uterine irritability', 'Uterine activity was reduced', 'Spontaneous labor', 'dilated', 'intact membranes', 'vertex presentation', 'normal progress of labor', 'delivered a viable male infant', 'intact perineum', 'placentas were delivered spontaneously', 'postpartum course was uncomplicated', 'stable condition']","['magnesium sulfate', 'metronidazole', 'ampicillin', 'indomethacin', 'magnesium sulfate', 'oxytocin', 'oxytocin', 'Oxytocin', 'ampicillin', 'metronidazole', 'MgSO4', 'amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'betamethasone', 'terbutaline', 'terbutaline']",['30'],"['prenatal assessment', 'conception', 'surgical', 'uncomplicated curettage for missed abortion', 'Transvaginal ultrasound', 'rescue cerclage', 'bedrest', 'ultrasonography', 'bed rest', 'sterile speculum exam', 'Microscopic examination of vaginal fluid', 'heart rates', 'cervical dilation', 'therapeutic', 'cerclage', 'tocolysis', 'hysterectomy', 'umbilical cord of twin A was divided and ligated near the cervix with 3-0 chromic gut suture', 'sterile speculum exam', 'Maternal vital signs', 'full bed rest', 'preterm labor precautions', 'serial ultrasounds', 'Formal biophysical profiles', 'BPP', 'estimated fetal weight', 'BPP score', 'terbutaline therapy', 'Epidural anesthesia', 'amniotomy', 'weighting', 'Apgar']","['six weeks', 'four years before presentation', 'two years later', 'seven weeks', '18 weeks', '192/7 weeks', 'One day later', 'One day later', 'several hours later', 'approximately 1 h later', 'over the next 24 h.', 'over the next 24 h.', 'one week later', '25 weeks', '34 weeks', '28 weeks', '28 weeks', '35 1/7 weeks', '48 h later']"

Physical examination revealed a 3.5-cm fungating lesion involving the upper half of the glans [Fig. ]. The lesion was malodorous with varying amounts of seropurulent discharge, partially ulcerated, erythematous, and slightly itchy. The superficial inguinal lymph nodes were not palpable. No similar lesions were evident on the head, neck, trunk, or arms. The patient had been treated in another hospital 8 years previously for TCC of the left renal pelvis by nephroureterectomy (pT2 Nx M0 G2). Subsequent postoperative follow-ups (every 6 months for the first 3 years after surgery and then once every year) consisting of a clinical examination, total body CT scan, and regular endoscopic examination showed no evidence of recurrence and the patient did well until he noticed the painful penile nodule. Pathological examination of incisional biopsies confirmed the lesion to be urothelial carcinoma [Fig. ]. A subsequent CT workup revealed a 4-cm lesion localized in the upper-right pulmonary lobe and enlarged pelvic lymph nodes suggestive of multiple metastases.
The patient began combination chemotherapy (gemcitabine at 1250 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15, and then every 28 days for six courses) and external beam radiotherapy to the mass, which promptly relieved the penile pain.

As noted above his HDL-C and uric acid levels are currently in the normal physiological range and his hs-CRP remains in the second quartile.
According to Framingham risk scores associated with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) guidelines [], few would have recommended any treatments other than therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) and possibly niacin, which our patient was intolerant both pre and post event in 1997.
If we score this patient according to the estimate of 10-year risk for men he gets 6 points for age 53, 2 points for total cholesterol 160–199 age 53, 3 points for being a pipe smoker, 2 points for HDL being < 40 mg/dL, and 1 point for systolic blood pressure 140–159 untreated. This totals 14 points and results in an estimated 10-year risk for men of 16%, which is less than the 20% recommended for more aggressive therapy.
Even if we apply the NCEP ATP III guidelines of having two plus risk factors: Male sex, hypertension, smoking, and low HDL-C with a 10 risk < or = to 20% we obtain the following recommendations: LDL-C goal < 130 mg/dL, initiation of TLC if LDL-C is = or > 130 mg/dL, consideration of drug therapy if LDL-C is > or = to 130 mg/dL after three months of TLC.

She had had the lesion for approximately 11 years. Initially, the patient was treated with excision and primary closure ten years ago. At this time the tumor had a diameter of 5 cm. The tumor was diagnosed as adenoid BCC microscopically and surgical margins were tumor-positive. The patient was operated on two years later when the diameter of the recurrent tumor was 15 mm. Histological examination of this second specimen revealed an ""adenoid BCC"" with clear surgical margins.
Although the tumor recurred again after the second excision, the patient neglected medical advice and did not undertake any treatment (Figure ). More recently, however, the tumor began growing rapidly and became hemorrhagic. On examination the lesion was located on the right inner canthus and involved 1/3 of the eyelid. The size of tumor was approximately 55 mm × 45 mm. Visual functions of the patient were normal. However, a fixed mass developed in the patient's periauricular area six months ago (Figure ), although there were no palpable cervical nodes. We therefore investigated this region with computed tomography (CT), which revealed a tumor involving the right orbital structures extending to the ethmoidal cells. The tumor also involved the right parotid gland and multiple cervical lymph nodes.
We also investigated this patient with a bone scan (normal), abdominal and cranial CT scans (also normal) and a thoracic CT. Multiple metastatic lesions were seen in the chest CT (Figure ).
Examinations of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, urogenital and hematological systems and other parts of the skin were performed by physical and routine laboratory and radiological techniques. There were no abnormal findings. Biopsy was performed from the tumor located on the inner canthus and revealed ""adenoid basal cell carcinoma"" (Figure ). Also, Fine needle biopsies were performed on the parotid and pulmonary lesions which confirmed the presence of adenoid BCC in these regions.
The patient did not accept the offer of surgical treatment for the tumor on the inner canthus. She was referred to the Oncology Department and treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The patient received approximately 6000 cGy of external beam radiation over 3 weeks totally. Also, chemotherapy was initiated with cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil. She was followed up with physical examination and CT scans for six months and there were no metastases to other organs.

Neurological examination and developmental status were normal at that point. Within 2 weeks, the patient deteriorated rapidly, with poor mobilization, feeding and verbalization. He was brought to the emergency room where an emergent computed tomographic scan showed a large left hemispheric cerebral mass (Figure ) with an underlying cystic component and a more superficial area of bright enhancement; the rest of the brain showed massive edema. He was emergently admitted and within 24 hours, a gross resection of the tumor was carried out. At surgery, following a parietal craniotomy, 50–60 cc of straw colored fluid was aspirated from the cystic component through a taut dura. After the excision of the dura, the bright area of enhancement previously noted was an area of tumor attachment to the dura in the parietal region. Otherwise, the tumor showed a well-demarcated interface with the subjacent normal brain parenchyma and a complete gross resection was achieved. A follow-up magnetic resonance image at 12 months post-surgery showed no evidence of tumor recurrence.

The patient had been diagnosed as having ventricular septum defect (VSD) without complications and had been well six months before admission, when the patient presented a temperature of 38.0°C and a productive cough. One month before admission, the patient was admitted elsewhere because of fever, general malaise, and macrohematuria. The temperature was 38.6°C, the pulse was 120 beats per minute, and respirations were 24 times per minute. The blood pressure was 130/58 mmHg. On physical examination, the patient appeared acutely ill and pansystolic murmur of Levine III/IV was noted at the 4th left sternal border (LSB). The urine was positive for hematuria (+++) and protein (+++); the sediment contained 150–160 RBC/hpf and 10–15 granular casts/hpf. Laboratory test revealed 2.04 mg/dl of serum creatinine, 33.3 mg/dl of BUN, and 9.0 g/dl of hemoglobin. Echocardiogram demonstrated VSD and vegetation on the tricuspid valve associated with regurgitation. The patient was transferred to our hospital for evaluation of renal dysfunction.
On the first hospital day, the temperature was 39.4°C and the physical examination demonstrated pansystolic murmur at the 4th LSB again, but no lymphoadenopathy and no localizing signs for a focus of infection. Laboratory findings were: anemia (Hb 8.6 g/dl, Ht 26.5%), presence of d-dimer (10.3 mg/ml), BUN 41 mg/dl, serum creatinine 2.49 mg/dl, proteinuria 0.96 g/24 h, 24 h Ccr 30.0 ml/min, hypocomplementemia (C3 29 mg/dl, CH50 16.5 U/ml), positive for inflammatory sign (CRP 2.8 mg/dl, ESR 104 mm/h), and positive for cryoglobulinemia (Table ). Antibodies for DNA, RNP, Sm, and myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3 ANCA were normal (Table ). Echocardiogram again showed vegetation on tricuspid valve and TR (Figure ), suggesting the presence of right-sided bacterial endocarditis. However, there were no histories of tooth extraction, skin injury, or drug addiction and serology for viruses including HIV-1 was negative. Specimens of blood were obtained 5 times for culture and demonstrated Propionibacterium Acnes. A renal biopsy specimen showed typical crescentic glomerulonephritis (Figure ) with interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration on PAS staining. Ten of eighteen glomeruli had cellular crescents without fibrocellular and fibrous crescents. Immune reactants such as C3 (Figure ) and Ig M were found in peripheral capillary walls and in the mesangium.
Bacterial endocarditis complicated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis was diagnosed and the intensive antibiotic therapy with penicillin G was started, without clinical improvement of renal function (on day 7 serum creatinine 6.21 mg/dl) or resolution of fever over the next 7 days. The initial antibiotics were replaced with ampicillin and imipenem in addition to low dose of corticosteroid treatment initiated with intravenous methylprednisolone 0.5-g per day for 3 consecutive days followed by oral prednisolone 30-mg, 20-mg, and 10-mg per day each for 3 days, respectively. On day 16, laboratory test demonstrated normalization of inflammatory signs (CRP 0.5, ESR 11 mm/h), serum complements, and circulating immune complex and negative for blood culture and cryoglobulin. After the short-term treatment of low dose of corticosteroid combined with continuous antibiotics, high fever and renal insufficiency were dramatically improved (Figure ). The antibiotic therapy lasted for 40 days until the day of the tricuspid valve-plasty and VSD closure. The patient was finally able to undergo the surgical operation, resulting in successful recovery from endocarditis-induced rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. He is now well and laboratory test showed normal serum creatinine 0.72 mg/dl, while echocardiogram demonstrated mild regurgitation of tricuspid valve.","[[24.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['renal', 'ventricular septum', 'Levine III/IV', '4th left sternal border', 'LSB', 'tricuspid valve', 'renal', '4th LSB', 'tricuspid valve', 'tooth', 'skin', 'renal', 'interstitial', 'peripheral capillary walls', 'mesangium', 'renal', 'renal', 'tricuspid valve', 'tricuspid valve']","['macrohematuria', 'general malaise', 'deterioration of renal function', 'ventricular septum defect', 'VSD', 'complications', 'cough', 'fever', 'general malaise', 'macrohematuria', 'ill', 'pansystolic murmur of Levine III/IV', 'hematuria', 'protein', 'VSD', 'vegetation', 'regurgitation', 'renal dysfunction', 'pansystolic murmur', 'lymphoadenopathy', 'localizing signs for a focus of infection', 'anemia', 'hypocomplementemia', 'inflammatory sign', 'cryoglobulinemia', 'vegetation', 'TR', 'right-sided bacterial endocarditis', 'tooth extraction', 'skin injury', 'drug addiction', 'Propionibacterium Acnes', 'crescentic glomerulonephritis', 'interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration', 'glomeruli', 'cellular crescents', 'fibrocellular and fibrous crescents', 'Immune reactants', 'C3', 'Ig M', 'Bacterial endocarditis', 'glomerulonephritis', 'improvement of renal function', 'fever', 'circulating immune complex', 'fever', 'renal insufficiency', 'VSD', 'endocarditis-induced rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis', 'well', 'regurgitation of tricuspid valve']","['penicillin G', 'ampicillin', 'imipenem', 'methylprednisolone', 'prednisolone']",['24-year'],"['temperature', 'temperature', 'pulse', 'respirations', 'blood pressure', 'physical examination', 'urine', 'sediment', 'Laboratory test', 'serum creatinine', 'BUN', 'hemoglobin', 'Echocardiogram', 'temperature', 'physical examination', 'Laboratory', 'Hb', 'Ht', 'd-dimer', 'BUN', 'serum creatinine', 'proteinuria', 'Ccr', 'C3', 'CH50', 'CRP', 'ESR', 'cryoglobulinemia', 'Antibodies', 'Antibodies for DNA, RNP, Sm, and myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3 ANCA', 'Echocardiogram', 'serology for viruses including HIV-1', 'culture', 'renal biopsy', 'PAS staining', 'intensive antibiotic therapy', 'serum creatinine', 'antibiotics', 'corticosteroid treatment', 'laboratory test', 'inflammatory signs', 'CRP', 'ESR', 'serum complements', 'circulating immune complex', 'blood culture', 'cryoglobulin', 'treatment', 'corticosteroid', 'antibiotics', 'antibiotic therapy', 'tricuspid valve-plasty', 'VSD closure', 'surgical operation', 'laboratory test', 'serum creatinine', 'creatinine', 'echocardiogram']","['One month before admission', 'One month before admission', 'One month before admission', 'on day 7', 'over the next 7 days', 'next 7 days']"

Her mother died at the age of 31 years of breast cancer. Examination revealed a 2 cm firm and mobile mass in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast. The left axilla contained two enlarged palpable lymph nodes.
Mammography showed a 2 cm oval density that was homogenous with sharp margins. Ultrasound characterized the mass as solid but with a complex internal architecture. Fine needle aspiration of the mass was performed. It was positive for carcinoma, showing a very cellular sample with many malignant epithelial cells in cohesive groups, as well as lying singly in a background of necrosis and inflammation. The surgeon subsequently performed an excisional biopsy.
Grossly, the excised mass measured 3.3 cm × 2.3 cm × 2.0 cm and appeared well circumscribed. The cut surface was grey and lobulated with variable fleshy and firm areas. Histological examination revealed a well-circumscribed biphasic neoplasm, consisting of proliferating stroma and compressed glands, displaying a well developed leaf-like architecture. The stroma was moderately cellular, mildly vascular, and lacked cytological atypia, mitoses, and stromal overgrowth. The features were consistent with a benign phyllodes tumor (figures &). More importantly, the epithelial component of the phyllodes tumor showed extensive ductal carcinoma in-situ, with multiple foci of invasive mammary carcinoma (figure ). The DCIS was of high nuclear grade, cribriform and micropapillary architecture, with (comedo-type) necrosis (figure ). The invasive carcinoma was of no special type, SBR Grade III/III (Score 8/9). Multiple tumor emboli were present within endothelial-lined spaces adjacent to the tumor, but the surrounding breast was otherwise unremarkable. Although the carcinomatous component was confined to the phyllodes tumor, the lesion was <1 mm from the nearest resection margin. Immunohistochemistry using smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and muscle specific actin demonstrated absence of the myoepithelial cell layer within areas of invasive carcinoma, and focal loss within areas of DCIS. There was intensely positive staining within 80% of tumor cells for estrogen and progesterone receptors.
The patient went on to have a left axillary lymph node dissection and subsequent pathological examination revealed 4 of 13 nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. She received adjuvant CEF (Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin, 5-Fluorouracil) chemotherapy and underwent further local excision to achieve wider margins; pathological examination was negative for residual tumor.

The past medical history of the patient was free.
The patient was presented with severe lower right abdominal pain, with signs of local peritonitis and a palpable mass in the same region. The body temperature was 37.2–37.4°C, while arterial blood pressure and cardiac rate 150/90 mmHg and 90/min respectively. The signs of local peritonitis combined with the palpable mass of the lower right abdominal area suggested perforation of the appendix and abscess formation. The laboratory examinations of the patient showed leucocytosis with white blood cell count (WBC) 19000 (with macrophage prevalence: 89%). Colonoscopy revealed obstruction of the right colon. Biopsies were not acquired because the colon lumen was obstructed and the endoscope could not approach the lesion. Computerized tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen (Figure ) revealed a soft lobular mass, measuring 5 × 5 cm, attached to the ascending colon and cecum, compatible with a tumor. The most possible diagnosis was that of a perforated colonic tumor. The patient underwent explorative laparotomy and right hemicolectomy with an end-to-end ileocolonic anastomosis. Thorough exploration of the abdominal cavity revealed no other pathologic findings.
The surgical specimen consisted of a 10 cm length of the terminal ileum and the whole of the right colon. The serosa was very heavily covered by suppurative exudates and fibrotic tissue.
Microscopic examination of the surgical specimen revealed thickening of the ascending colon wall with neutrophilic infiltration. Numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes within the muscularis and a fibro-purulent reaction over the serosa with actinomycotic ""sulfur granules"" in it, were found in high power magnification (Figure ).

She was followed up at a local clinic. On the follow-up study, the patient's CEA level was raised to 43.32 U/L and CT scan showed splenomegaly with cystic lesion. Her past medical history was not significant. She already underwent two surgeries. The first surgery, right salpingo-oophorectomy, was performed at the age of 22 after being diagnosed as dermoid cyst. She was healthy thereafter. Seven years later, left ovarian mass was found on the routine check. At the second surgery, left ovarian mass excision, mucinous tumor of borderline malignancy was diagnosed.
During follow-up after the second surgery, she was referred to our hospital on the suspicion of carcinomatosis peritonei. On the preoperative evaluation (Figure ), splenic lesion, which had been existed for 2 years, was merely noticed as simple cystic lesion unrelated to the ovarian mass.
To exclude peritoneal carcinomatosis, open laparotomy was perfomed. On opening the abdomen, no abnormal gross findings were found except the splenic lesion, which reported as probable metastatic adenocarcinoma on frozen sections. After splenectomy was carried out, peritoneal washings and multiple biopsies on the omentum, peritoneum, mesentery, and left ovary were performed to rule out possible microscopic peritoneal dissemination. Suspecting the transabdominal metastasis, 100 mg of cisplatin was infused into the peritoneal cavity at the end of the operation; however no intraperitoneal recurrence was confirmed after tissue diagnosis.
Final pathologic examination (Figure ) showed metastatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. Peritoneal washings and multiple biopsies were all negative. The patient was recovered from the surgery without the evidence of sepsis of severe thrombocytosis. The patient received 5 courses of Taxol and Carboplatin as postoperative chemotherapy.

Physical examination during this visit revealed an afebrile patient with a blood pressure of 138/84 mm Hg, regular pulse of 84/minute. An ejection systolic murmur (2/6 in intensity) was heard all over the precordium likely from the flow across his prosthesis. No continuous murmurs were heard. No evidence for clinical heart failure, anemia, jaundice or infection was noted. Laboratory tests revealed no leukocytosis and blood cultures were negative. Given prior echo documentation of fistula and new symptomatology suggestive of heart failure, a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was requested for more detailed assessment of prosthesis and AAF. TEE revealed normal left ventricular function, normal aortic prosthesis function with trivial aortic regurgitation. An echolucent area above the mechanical prosthesis, close to the left atrium near the orifice of the left coronary artery was noted. There appeared to be expansion of a portion of this lucency into the left atrium during systole suggesting communication with the aorta (Fig ) with turbulent color flow from the aorta into the left atrium (suggestive of AAF) throughout the cardiac cycle but mainly in systole as shown by color and continuous wave doppler (Figs and ). Compared to the prior 2-D echo there appeared to be mild left atrial dilation, mild left ventricular hypertrophy and significantly more prominent fistula flow suggesting either progressive shunting and enlargement of the fistula over time or underestimation by the prior 2-D echo. Although the echocardiographic findings mimicked changes which could also be related to endocarditis (abscess around prosthesis with pseudoaneurysm formation), the absence of any obvious vegetations or prosthetic malfunction combined with lack of clinical and laboratory evidence of endocarditis favoured a more slowly progressive postoperative complication rather than an infectious process. Based on his heart failure symptoms and progressive increase in AAF size and flow, surgical correction was recommended. He underwent uncomplicated surgical repair of the AAF which was found during surgery to be inferior to the left coronary ostium. No evidence of abscess or infection was found and the prosthesis appeared intact and healthy. The echo lucent area represented a postoperative weakening of the aortic wall adjacent to the left atrium, predisposing to the fistula formation and was also repaired. Intra-operative TEE showed no residual fistula by color flow at the site of repair.","[[66.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['heart', 'native and subsequent prosthetic valve', 'left ventricular', 'prosthetic valve', 'aorto-atrial', 'aorta', 'aorta-and the left atrium', 'left atrium', 'precordium', 'heart', 'heart', 'transesophageal', 'left ventricular', 'aortic', 'aortic', 'left atrium near the orifice of the left coronary artery', 'left atrium', 'aorta', 'aorta', 'left atrium', 'cardiac cycle', 'left atrial', 'left ventricular', 'heart', 'inferior to the left coronary ostium', 'aortic wall adjacent to the left atrium', 'left atrium', 'site of repair']","['rheumatic heart disease', 'native and subsequent prosthetic valve regurgitation', 'fatigue', 'dyspnea', 'nocturnal dyspnea', 'hypertension', 'hyperlipidemia', 'preserved left ventricular and prosthetic valve function', 'aorto-atrial fistula', 'ejection murmur across the mechanical prosthesis', 'murmurs', 'complication', 'asymptomatic status', 'did well', 'afebrile', 'ejection systolic murmur', 'continuous murmurs', 'clinical heart failure', 'anemia', 'jaundice', 'infection', 'leukocytosis', 'fistula', 'symptomatology', 'heart failure', 'prosthesis', 'AAF', 'normal left ventricular function', 'normal aortic prosthesis function', 'aortic regurgitation', 'echolucent area above the mechanical prosthesis', 'expansion of a portion of this lucency', 'systole', 'communication with the aorta', 'turbulent color flow', 'AAF', 'systole', 'left atrial dilation', 'left ventricular hypertrophy', 'fistula flow', 'shunting', 'enlargement of the fistula', 'mimicked changes', 'endocarditis', 'abscess around prosthesis', 'pseudoaneurysm formation', 'vegetations', 'prosthetic malfunction', 'endocarditis', 'postoperative complication', 'infectious process', 'heart failure symptoms', 'AAF size and flow', 'AAF', 'abscess', 'infection', 'prosthesis appeared intact and healthy', 'echo lucent area', 'weakening of the aortic wall adjacent to the left atrium', 'fistula formation', 'fistula']",[],['66'],"['aortic valve replacement', 'AVR', 'AVR', '2-dimensional echocardiogram (TTE)', 'Physical examination', 'blood pressure', 'regular pulse', 'Laboratory tests', 'blood cultures', 'echo', 'transesophageal echocardiography', 'TEE', 'TEE', 'color and continuous wave doppler', '2-D', '2-D echo', '2-D echo', 'echocardiographic', 'laboratory', 'surgical correction', 'surgical repair of the AAF', 'repaired', 'TEE']","['4 years prior', '4 years prior to this presentation', 'postoperative', 'currently', 'postoperative', 'postoperative', 'Intra-operative']"

83,546237-1,15638946,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC546237.xml,An unusual presentation of a malignant jejunal tumor and a different management strategy,"A 45-year-old male was referred to our center with the diagnosis of suspected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the bowel in December 1999. He had generalized weakness for 2-years along with recurrent vomiting, occasional constipation and melaena for last 2 months. The diagnosis was considered after an ultrasound (USG) guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from the intra-abdominal mass done elsewhere and showed features suspicious of NHL.
At presentation, patient's general condition was poor and he was dehydrated and pale. There was no peripheral lymphaedenopathy. Abdominal examination revealed an ill-defined, mobile, nontendor lump in left paraumblical region extending up to left lumber region. There was no hepato-splenomegaly. Examination of chest and cardiovascular system was normal. After initial resuscitation with crystalloids and blood transfusion, patient was further investigated.
At presentation his hemoglobin was low (6.4 gm%) but rest of the routine haematological investigations were within normal limit. The chest X-ray was normal. Abdominal ultrasound (USG) showed a left upper abdominal mass lesion suggestive of bowel mass. The upper GI endoscopy was normal. The barium meal follow through examination was suggestive of intussusception of proximal jejunum and a suspected mass lesion at the leading edge of intussusceptum. An USG guided core needle biopsy of mass was performed because of earlier suspicion of NHL, which showed smooth muscle bundles with areas of necrosis. Based on the above findings and biopsy report, patient was taken up for exploratory laparotomy 3 weeks after initial presentation.
Operative findings revealed an intussuscepted proximal jejunum loop 12 cm distal to duodeno-jejunal flexure and a vascular polypoidal growth measuring 6.5 × 5 × 3.5 cms on serosal surface of jejunum. Liver and spleen were normal. There was no evidence of mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphaedenopathy, ascites or peritoneal disease. The resection of involved segment of jejunum with 5 cm margins and an end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful.
Pathological examination of the specimen revealed two mass lesions measuring 4.5 cm & 3 cm in continuity (total 7.5 cm in maximum diameter) located on mucosal and serosal surface of jejunum respectively. Microscopically it showed spindle cell tumor with a mitotic rate of 5/10 high power fields (HPF). The tumor was negative for desmin, S-100, CD 34 and c-kit (CD117) but focally positive for actin on immunohistochemistry (IHC). The resection margins were free. The final diagnosis of malignant spindle cell tumor – leiomyosarcoma of jejunum was made. Due to negative margins and no evidence of disease elsewhere, no adjuvant therapy was planned and patient was kept on regular follow up. He was assessed clinically at three months interval and an USG of abdomen was performed six monthly. Patient remained disease free for 39 months. After that a follow-up USG showed a space-occupying lesion (SOL) in segment VII of liver and a mass lesion in left upper abdomen. The patient was asymptomatic and abdominal examination revealed no abnormality. A computerized tomographic (CT) scan of abdomen was performed which showed a 2 × 2 cms, brightly enhancing SOL in segment VII of liver (Figure ) and a 3 × 4 cms omental mass lesion abutting the bowel loop in left upper abdomen (Figure ). Upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any abnormality. A provisional diagnosis of recurrent leiomyosarcoma was made. Patient was planned for resection of the mass and RFA of liver lesion.
Patient was explored and two separate well encapsulated, fleshy mass lesions were found in infracolic omentum, measuring 6 × 7 × 3.5 and 2 × 1 × 1 cms. The liver lesion was not palpable and there was no evidence of disease at primary site or anywhere else in peritoneal cavity. An infracolic omentectomy along with tumor nodules was performed.
The histopathological features were suggestive of a highly cellular tumor composed of spindle shaped cells arranged in interlacing fascicles. On immunohistochemistry, multiple sections were negative for CD-34, CD-117, S-100 and desmin but focally positive for actin as in the initial tumor. So a diagnosis of recurrent leiomyosarcoma was made. The patient was taken up for an USG guided RFA of liver metastasis 3 weeks after surgery. The RFA was performed by Cool Tip™ RF machine [Radionics, USA] using single tip probe. The procedure was conducted for 12 minutes at temperature of 65°C and the lesion was ablated with 1 cm margin. Follow-up CT scan done 3 days later showed complete ablation of metastatic lesion (Figure ). The patient was kept on regular follow-up and nine months after RFA he was asymptomatic and an abdominal CT scan showed no evidence of recurrence.","[[45.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['bowel', 'intra-abdominal', 'Abdominal', 'left paraumblical region', 'left lumber region', 'chest', 'cardiovascular system', 'chest', 'Abdominal', 'left upper abdominal', 'bowel', 'upper GI', 'proximal jejunum', 'leading edge of intussusceptum', 'muscle bundles', 'proximal jejunum loop 12 cm distal to duodeno-jejunal flexure', 'serosal surface of jejunum', 'Liver', 'spleen', 'mesenteric', 'retroperitoneal', 'peritoneal', 'segment of jejunum', 'jejunum', 'mucosal', 'serosal surface of jejunum', 'spindle cell', 'jejunum', 'abdomen', 'segment VII of liver', 'left upper abdomen', 'abdomen', 'abdominal', 'segment VII of liver', 'omental', 'bowel loop in left upper abdomen', 'abdomen', 'Upper GI', 'liver', 'infracolic omentum', 'liver', 'primary site', 'peritoneal cavity', 'cellular', 'liver', 'abdominal']","[""non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", 'NHL', 'generalized weakness', 'vomiting', 'constipation', 'melaena', 'intra-abdominal mass', 'NHL', 'general condition was poor', 'dehydrated', 'pale', 'peripheral lymphaedenopathy', 'lump', 'hepato-splenomegaly', 'left upper abdominal mass lesion', 'bowel mass', 'intussusception of proximal jejunum', 'mass lesion', 'mass', 'NHL', 'smooth muscle bundles', 'necrosis', 'intussuscepted proximal jejunum loop 12 cm distal to duodeno-jejunal flexure', 'vascular polypoidal growth', 'lymphaedenopathy', 'ascites', 'peritoneal disease', 'margins', 'postoperative course was uneventful', 'mass lesions', 'spindle cell tumor', 'tumor', 'desmin', 'resection margins were free', 'malignant spindle cell tumor', 'leiomyosarcoma of jejunum', 'disease', 'disease', 'space-occupying lesion', 'SOL', 'mass lesion', 'asymptomatic', 'abnormality', 'enhancing SOL', 'omental mass lesion', 'abnormality', 'leiomyosarcoma', 'mass', 'liver lesion', 'mass', 'mass lesions', 'liver lesion', 'disease', 'tumor nodules', 'cellular tumor', 'CD-34', 'CD-117', 'S-100', 'desmin', 'focally positive for actin', 'tumor', 'leiomyosarcoma', 'liver metastasis', 'lesion', 'complete ablation of metastatic lesion', 'asymptomatic', 'recurrence']",[],"['45', 'December 1999']","['ultrasound', 'ultrasound (USG) guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)', 'USG', 'resuscitation', 'crystalloids', 'blood transfusion', 'hemoglobin', 'haematological', 'chest X-ray', 'Abdominal ultrasound (USG)', 'upper GI endoscopy', 'barium meal', 'USG guided core needle biopsy of mass', 'biopsy', 'exploratory laparotomy', 'resection of involved segment of jejunum with 5 cm margins and an end-to-end anastomosis', 'end-to-end anastomosis', 'Pathological examination', 'Microscopically', 'mitotic rate', 'desmin', 'S-100', 'CD 34', 'c-kit', 'CD117', 'actin', 'immunohistochemistry', 'IHC', 'adjuvant therapy', 'USG of abdomen', 'USG', 'abdominal examination', 'computerized tomographic (CT)', 'computerized tomographic (CT) scan of abdomen', 'Upper GI endoscopy', 'colonoscopy', 'resection of the mass', 'RFA of liver lesion', 'infracolic omentectomy', 'immunohistochemistry', 'USG guided RFA of liver metastasis', 'RFA', 'procedure', 'lesion was ablated with 1 cm margin', 'CT scan', 'RFA', 'abdominal CT scan']","['December 1999', 'December 1999', '2-years', 'last 2 months', 'last 2 months', '3 weeks', 'six monthly', '39 months', '3 weeks', '3 days later', 'nine months']"
84,547911-1,15649336,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC547911.xml,Enterococcal meningitis caused by Enterococcus casseliflavus. First case report,"A 77-year-old Italian female presented for evaluation of fever, stupor, diarrhea and vomiting of 3 days duration. She had no urinary symptoms. There was no history of head injury nor of previous surgical procedures. She had been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis for 30 years, for which she was being treated with steroids and methotrexate; other medical problems were insulin-dependent diabetes and moderate renal failure.
On admission, she was febrile (temperature, 38.0°C), alert but not oriented to time and place. Her neck was stiff, and she had a positive Kernig's sign. A CT brain scan showed an increase in subarachnoid space and in the volume of the ventricular system.
Laboratory examinations revealed a white blood cell count of 15,100/μL with 70% neutrophils and 23% lymphocytes. Results of urinalysis were unremarkable. Cultures of blood and urine were drawn and subsequently resulted negative.
The patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was opalescent with a glucose concentration of 14 mg/dl, a protein level of 472 mg/dl, and a white cell count of 200/μL with 95% polymorphonuclear leukocytes and 5% lymphocytes. Gram staining of CSF revealed no organisms. Pending the culture results the patient was empirically treated with intravenous meropenem, cotrimoxazole, acyclovir and dexamethasone.
Culture of CSF yielded E. casseliflavus that was identified using the Vitek-2 system (bioMérieux-Vitek) on the basis of 6.5% NaCl tolerance, bile-esculin hydrolysis, and growth rate at 45°C, arginine hydrolysis, methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside testing, and acid production from ribose, motility testing, and yellow pigmentation testing.
The isolate was sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, imipenem, teicoplanin, tetracyclines and linezolid; it exhibited intermediate sensitivity to vancomycin (MIC, ≥8 μg/mL), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (MIC, ≥10 μg/mL), levofloxacin (MIC, 4 μg/mL), norfloxacin (MIC, 8 μg/mL), ciprofloxacin (MIC, 2 μg/mL) and quinupristin-dalfopristin (MIC, 2 μg/mL); it was resistant to clindamycin (MIC, 4 μg/mL) and showed high resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin and kanamycin (MIC, ≥2000 μg/mL).
The patient became afebrile 48 hours after the beginning of antibiotic therapy with rapid improvement of her mental status and disappearance of meningeal signs (within 36 hours).
Once the organism was identified (4 days later), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and acyclovir were discontinued and ampicillin-sulbactam (3 g every 6 hours) was added. After 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy the patient was discharged in good health with sterilization of the CSF culture. An echocardiogram revealed no vegetations whereas a colonoscopy examination showed two ulcerative lesions associated with two polyps, oedema and multiple punctuate erosions.
Enterococcal infections of the central nervous system are quite rare and according to a MEDLINE search of the English literature only three cases of CNS infection by a motile Enterococcus identified as E. gallinarum have been previously documented; they occurred in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts for hydrocephalus [,]. E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum are responsible for 1–2% of all enterococcal infections and are characterized by the fact that they possess intrinsic low-level vancomycin resistance []. The VanC-1 ligase is specific for E. gallinarum, and the VanC-2/3 ligase is specific for E. casseliflavus []. Organisms with resistance to VanC remain susceptible to teicoplanin. This naturally occurring vancomycin resistance has not been shown to be transferable, and the related genes are chromosomally encoded in the members of these species [,,].
Despite the intrinsic low-level vancomycin resistance exhibited by E. casseliflavus it is important to remember that most strains are susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin. Combination therapy of ampicillin with an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin or streptomycin is considered the standard therapy of enterococcal meningitis due to ampicillin-susceptible strains []. Meropenem is not superior to ampicillin for therapy of enterococcal infections and most species of E. casseliflavus are beta-lactamase negative. There was not therefore a clear indication for the use of combination therapy with meropenem and a beta-lactamase inhibitor in the case reported.
Our patient had gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, and colonoscopy revealed multiple erosions, which probably were the portal of entry of E. casseliflavus.
In fact, enterococcal meningitis may appear as a complication of diverse gastrointestinal diseases such as enterocolitis, peritonitis, abdominal surgery, or bowel carcinoma. A case of bowel erosions as the portal of entry of enterococcal meningitis has been previously reported [].
Several studies have demonstrated that E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus colonize the gastrointestinal tracts of both hospitalized individuals and nonhospitalized healthy ones [,,]. Therapy with various antimicrobial agents, including cephalosporins and vancomycin, may play a role in increasing colonization with these organisms. Edlund et al. reported a significant increase in the emergence of E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus in healthy subjects who were administered oral vancomycin []. Our patient was not taking any antimicrobials before hospital admission. E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus/flavescens are part of the normal stool flora of the general population; this has perhaps impacted the ability of researchers to detect specific risk factors [].
Although our patient had significant underlying conditions this case of meningitis was mild and had most of the typical features of ""spontaneous"" enterococcal meningitis (community-acquired infection, severe underlying diseases, and immunodepression).
The clinical significance of the enterococci that are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin has not been fully established yet. Infection with E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus has been associated with high mortality, but it is difficult to attribute their mortality directly to infection or to the underlying conditions of the patient.","[[77.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['urinary', 'head', 'renal', 'neck', 'brain', 'subarachnoid space', 'ventricular system', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'mental status', 'meningeal', 'central nervous system', 'CNS', 'ventriculoperitoneal', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal', 'abdominal', 'bowel', 'bowel', 'gastrointestinal tracts']","['fever', 'stupor', 'diarrhea', 'vomiting', 'urinary symptoms', 'head injury', 'rheumatoid arthritis', 'insulin-dependent diabetes', 'renal failure', 'febrile', 'alert', 'oriented to time and place', 'neck was stiff', 'stiff', ""Kernig's sign"", 'increase in subarachnoid space', 'volume of the ventricular system', 'cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was opalescent', 'opalescent', 'organisms', 'E. casseliflavus', 'sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, imipenem, teicoplanin, tetracyclines and linezolid', 'resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin and kanamycin', 'afebrile', 'rapid improvement of her mental status', 'disappearance of meningeal signs', 'meningeal signs', 'organism', 'good health', 'vegetations', 'ulcerative lesions', 'polyps', 'oedema', 'punctuate erosions', 'Enterococcal infections of the central nervous system', 'CNS infection', 'motile Enterococcus', 'E. gallinarum', 'hydrocephalus', 'E. casseliflavus', 'E. gallinarum', 'enterococcal infections', 'vancomycin resistance', 'VanC-1 ligase', 'E. gallinarum', 'VanC-2/3 ligase', 'E. casseliflavus', 'Organisms with resistance to VanC', 'Organisms with resistance to VanC remain susceptible to teicoplanin', 'vancomycin resistance', 'related genes are chromosomally encoded', 'vancomycin resistance', 'E. casseliflavus', 'enterococcal meningitis', 'ampicillin-susceptible strains', 'enterococcal infections', 'E. casseliflavus', 'beta-lactamase', 'signs', 'symptoms', 'erosions', 'portal of entry of E. casseliflavus', 'enterococcal meningitis', 'gastrointestinal diseases', 'enterocolitis', 'peritonitis', 'bowel carcinoma', 'bowel erosions', 'enterococcal meningitis', 'E. gallinarum', 'E. casseliflavus', 'emergence of E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus', 'E. gallinarum', 'E. gallinarum', 'E. casseliflavus', 'flavescens', 'normal stool flora', 'underlying conditions', 'meningitis', 'enterococcal meningitis', 'community-acquired infection', 'underlying diseases', 'immunodepression', 'enterococci', 'Infection', 'E. gallinarum', 'E. casseliflavus', 'mortality', 'mortality', 'infection', 'underlying conditions']","['methotrexate', 'meropenem', 'cotrimoxazole', 'acyclovir', 'dexamethasone', 'NaCl', 'penicillin', 'ampicillin', 'ampicillin-sulbactam', 'imipenem', 'teicoplanin', 'tetracyclines', 'linezolid', 'vancomycin', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'levofloxacin', 'norfloxacin', 'ciprofloxacin', 'quinupristin-dalfopristin', 'clindamycin', 'gentamicin', 'streptomycin', 'kanamycin', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'acyclovir', 'ampicillin-sulbactam', 'VanC', 'teicoplanin', 'vancomycin', 'penicillin', 'ampicillin', 'ampicillin', 'aminoglycoside', 'gentamicin', 'streptomycin', 'ampicillin', 'Meropenem', 'ampicillin', 'meropenem', 'vancomycin', 'vancomycin', 'vancomycin']",['77'],"['surgical procedures', 'steroids', 'temperature', 'CT brain scan', 'Laboratory examinations', 'white blood cell count', 'neutrophils', 'lymphocytes', 'urinalysis', 'Cultures of blood and urine', 'glucose concentration', 'protein level', 'white cell count', 'polymorphonuclear leukocytes', 'lymphocytes', 'Gram staining of CSF', 'culture', 'Culture of CSF', 'NaCl tolerance', 'bile-esculin hydrolysis', 'growth rate', 'arginine', 'arginine hydrolysis', 'methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside testing', 'acid production from ribose', 'motility testing', 'yellow pigmentation testing', 'MIC', 'antibiotic therapy', 'antibiotic therapy', 'sterilization of the CSF culture', 'sterilization of the CSF culture', 'echocardiogram', 'colonoscopy examination', 'ventriculoperitoneal shunts', 'Combination therapy', 'standard therapy', 'combination therapy', 'beta-lactamase', 'beta-lactamase inhibitor', 'colonoscopy', 'abdominal surgery', 'studies', 'Therapy', 'antimicrobial agents', 'cephalosporins', 'antimicrobials']","['3 days', '3 days', '3 days', '3 days', '30 years', '48 hours', 'within 36 hours']"

Videofluroscopy and Speech assessment confirmed an improvement in aspiration and speech. Six months later, her symptoms recurred with subsequent aspiration pneumonia. A decision was made after lengthy counseling to proceed with a laryngectomy 13 months following the implantation of Gore-Tex. Figure shows the Gore-Tex in the laryngectomy specimen.
Light microscopy revealed a mild foreign-body giant cell granulomatous reaction with some associated fibrosis (Figures and ). The granulomatous response was limited to the periphery of the Gore-Tex and although it closely followed the profile of the material it did not encroach into or significantly break up the material. However, some fibrosis penetrated a short way into the Gore-Tex in a few areas. The giant cells were present mainly in a multinucleated form. Figure shows the Gore-Tex strip under crossed Polaroids showing birefringence of the implanted material. Birefringent fragments were only very occasionally seen within isolated giant cells. The giant cell response was mainly seen in areas where the end of a Gore-Tex strip formed a sharp corner. In one area a very small focus of metaplastic bone formation was seen. There was no significant lymphocytic, neutrophilic inflammation or vascular ingrowth.","[[64.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['transcervical', 'right vagal', 'right vocal fold', 'right vocal fold', 'chest', 'cricothyroid', 'periphery of the Gore-Tex', 'isolated giant cells', 'areas where the end of a Gore-Tex strip formed a sharp corner', 'bone']","['right vagal neurofibroma', 'right vocal fold paralysis', 'dysphonia', 'aspiration', 'improvement', 'aspiration', 'chest infections', 'dysphonia', 'improvement in aspiration and speech', 'symptoms', 'aspiration pneumonia', 'Gore-Tex in the laryngectomy specimen', 'foreign-body giant cell granulomatous reaction', 'fibrosis', 'granulomatous response', 'fibrosis penetrated a short way into the Gore-Tex in a few areas', 'giant cells', 'Gore-Tex strip under crossed Polaroids', 'birefringence of the implanted material', 'Birefringent fragments', 'isolated giant cells', 'giant cell response', 'metaplastic bone formation', 'lymphocytic', 'neutrophilic inflammation', 'vascular ingrowth']",[],['64'],"['transcervical excision of a right vagal neurofibroma', 'fat injection for medialization of the right vocal fold', 'right medialization using Gore-Tex implant', 'Videofluroscopy', 'Speech assessment', 'laryngectomy', 'implantation of Gore-Tex', 'Light microscopy']","['Six months later', 'Six months later', '13 months']"
86,548138-1,15651984,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC548138.xml,Sister Joseph's nodule in a liver transplant recipient: Case report and mini-review of literature,"A 59-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital for progressively enlarging but painless mass in the region of the umbilicus. The umbilical mass of approximately 5 cm in diameter and has developed two months after liver transplantation. The nodule was firm with irregular borders, wine-red shade and fixed to the surrounding tissues. The overlying skin was not ulcerated. She never smoked, consumed alcohol or used oral contraceptive pills. The gynecological history was unremarkable. The patient underwent a liver transplantation for end stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to hepatitis C in mid of 2003. Prior to the transplant, her serum alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP) and CEA concentration were measured and both were within normal limits. The transplant procedure and immediate post-transplant period were unremarkable. The post-transplant immunosuppressive regimen consisted of Tacrolimus (6 mg/day) and steroids (prednisone 10 mg/day). Two months after transplantation, during routine follow-up, physical examination revealed multiple subcutaneous satellite nodules in close proximity to the umbilical region and lower abdominal wall. There was bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. A plain anterior/posterior chest x-ray was normal. Ultrasound of the abdominal cavity showed a 4 × 4 cm mass below the umbilicus and additional smaller nodules confined to the lower abdominal wall. Paraaortic lymph nodes were not identified. The echogenicity of the mass consisted of alternative hyper- and hypoechoic with poorly defined edges. However, the general condition of the patient was good and the laboratory test showed: hemoglobin level 9.6 g/dl, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dl, conjugated bilirubin 0.1 mg/dl, Alkaline Phosphates 273 U/l, GGT 40 U/L, AST 36 U/L, and ALT 56 U/L. There was serological evidence of past hepatitis C virus infection. The biopsy of the umbilical mass showed features characteristic for a poorly differentiated serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma. An extended resection of the umbilical and paraumbilical metastasis was performed. In addition, extensive investigation to detect the primary neoplastic origin was initiated. Tumor marker evaluation consisted of: CEA 0.22 [normal 0–3.7 ng/ml], alpha feto protein 1.49 (normal: 0.8–9.4 UI/ml), CA125 27.73 (normal: 0–30 UI/ml), CA 19.9 was 8.61 (normal: 0–36.2 UI/ml), CA 15.3 was 22.48 (normal: 0–35 UI/ml). Multiple tumor marker measurements were obtained and each time similar results were reported. A computed tomographic (CT) scan was unable to demonstrate any lesion that could be considered a primary source of the metastasis to the umbilicus. Trans-vaginal ultrasonography showed a normal uterus and ovaries; ultrasonographic examination of thyroid and breast did not show any pathological changes as well. In spite of laborious efforts, the tumor's primary site was not found at that time. However, considering the histological results, the umbilicus metastasis could be attributed almost entirely to the ovarian cancer stage 4, since the main primary site in females are the ovaries. In order to prevent further tumor extension and expansion, tacrolimus was reduced from 6 mg/day to 1.5 mg/day. In addition, chemotherapy with Taxol was initiated (50 mg/m2 I.V) once a week for 16 weeks. To date, after 6 months of follow-up, the patient is doing well, the liver function is normal and tacrolimus serum level is 1 ng/ml. A recent whole body CT-scan showed regression of iliac and inguinal lymph nodes involvement.","[[59.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['region of the umbilicus', 'umbilical', 'liver', 'surrounding tissues', 'overlying skin', 'gynecological', 'liver', 'subcutaneous', 'umbilical region', 'lower abdominal wall', 'bilateral inguinal', 'anterior/posterior chest', 'abdominal cavity', 'umbilicus', 'lower abdominal wall', 'Paraaortic', 'Paraaortic lymph nodes', 'umbilical', 'papillary', 'umbilical', 'paraumbilical', 'umbilicus', 'uterus', 'ovaries', 'thyroid', 'breast', 'umbilicus', 'ovarian', 'ovaries', 'liver', 'whole body', 'iliac', 'inguinal lymph nodes']","['mass', 'umbilical mass', 'nodule', 'ulcerated', 'unremarkable', 'end stage liver disease', 'ESLD', 'hepatitis', 'hepatitis C', 'unremarkable', 'subcutaneous satellite nodules', 'nodules', 'bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy', 'mass below the umbilicus', 'nodules', 'Paraaortic lymph nodes', 'echogenicity of the mass', 'general condition of the patient was good', 'hepatitis C virus infection', 'umbilical mass', 'papillary cystadenocarcinoma', 'metastasis', 'neoplastic origin', 'lesion', 'metastasis', 'pathological changes', ""tumor's primary site"", 'umbilicus metastasis', 'ovarian cancer', 'tumor extension and expansion', 'regression of iliac and inguinal lymph nodes']","['Tacrolimus', 'prednisone', 'tacrolimus', 'Taxol']","['59', 'mid of 2003']","['liver transplantation', 'oral contraceptive pills', 'liver transplantation', 'serum alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP)', 'CEA concentration', 'transplant procedure', 'immunosuppressive regimen', 'steroids', 'transplantation', 'physical examination', 'plain anterior/posterior chest x-ray', 'Ultrasound of the abdominal cavity', 'laboratory test', 'hemoglobin level', 'total bilirubin', 'conjugated bilirubin', 'Alkaline Phosphates', 'GGT', 'AST', 'ALT', 'serological', 'biopsy of the umbilical mass', 'extended resection of the umbilical and paraumbilical metastasis', 'extensive investigation', 'Tumor marker evaluation', 'CEA', 'alpha feto protein', 'CA125', 'CA', 'CA', 'CA 15.3', 'Multiple tumor marker measurements', 'computed tomographic (CT) scan', 'Trans-vaginal ultrasonography', 'ultrasonographic examination of thyroid and breast', 'histological', 'chemotherapy', 'liver function', 'tacrolimus serum level', 'whole body CT-scan']","['two months', 'mid of 2003', 'Prior to the transplant', 'post-transplant', 'post-transplant', 'Two months', 'at that time']"
87,548298-1,15617569,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC548298.xml,First documented cure of a suggestive exogenous reinfection in polymyositis with same but multidrug resistant M. tuberculosis,"A 23-year-old polymyositis patient with suggestive clinical symptoms, muscle biopsy, enzyme assay, needle EMG and NCV test was on immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg/day for 3 to 4 weeks, tapered gradually over a period of 10 weeks to 1 mg/kg every alternate days and methotrexate at 7.5 mg weekly with gradual increase to 25 mg weekly for a period of 1 year when he experienced slightly improved muscle power.
He had single cutaneous abscess 6 months later on the right side of the neck with no sinus formation and cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. He was HIV-negative with normal CXR and there was no AFB in three consecutive (spot-early morning-spot) sputum samples (induced in two occasions). However, the aspirated pus from cutaneous abscess and biopsy of the axillary lymph node showed plenty of M. tuberculosis as culture was confirmed by niacin and nitrate reduction tests, rapid bacteriophage assay (FAST Plaque Tuberculosis kit, BIOTEC Laboratories Ltd, UK) and RFLP analysis (figure ) using species-specific probes for devR (Differentially expressed virulent gene) [].
In RFLP analysis, the devR gene (Gene bank nucleotide sequence accession no. U22037) encodes a response regulator that is part of a two-component signal transduction system of M. tuberculosis. The authenticity of the amplified product was established by hybridization of immobilized PCR products to an internal oligonucleotide, devR1, mapping within the devR gene. The chromosomal DNA was prepared by chloroform-isoamyl alcohol DNA extraction and 4.5 μg of DNA from the isolate was restricted with PvuII. Separation of PvuII-restricted DNA by electrophoresis, Southern blot hybridization with a 513-bp PCR probes for devR (devRf, 5' GGTGAGGCGGGTTCGGTCGC 3'; devRr, 5' CGCGGCTTGCGTCCGACGTTC 3') and chemiluminescence detection were done according to the standard method recommended for the DNA fingerprinting of M. tuberculosis []. Histopathologically there were nonspecific necrosis with disintegrating polymorphs, very few granulomatous cells and no epithelioid cells in the biopsy specimen. USG of kidney, liver or spleen revealed no abscess. The strain was susceptible to the 4 first line drugs [isoniazide (H), rifampicin (R), ethambutol (E) and pyrazinamide (Z)] by BACTEC 460TB system. Treatment with 4-drug regimen (H = 300 mg/d, R = 450 mg/d, E = 800 mg/d and Z = 1.5 g/d) for 8 months (2EHRZ/6HR) [] with first 2 months supervised showed clinical improvement.
However, the patient returned 6 months later with multiple cutaneous abscesses, mainly on his back, left thigh and left arm and miliary mottling in CXR. He denied any irregularity in antituberculosis therapy. All immunosuppressive drugs (corticosteroids and methotrexate) were discontinued as he was readmitted. Isolates from 2 of 3 consecutive sputum samples and aspirated pus samples from all 5 completely drained abscesses were reconfirmed as the identical M. tuberculosis strain by phage assay and RFLP analysis (figure ). The isolate was resistant to 4 first-line drugs by BACTEC 460TB system and to 9 drugs, tested into Loewenstein Jensen media (Hi-media, Mumbai, India): H (1 μg/ml), H (10 μg/ml), R (20 μg/ml), R (50 μg/ml), E (2 μg/ml), E (10 μg/ml), Z (50 μg/ml, at pH 5.5), streptomycin (5 μg/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), paraaminosalicylate (2.5 μg/ml), cycloserine (30 μg/ml), amikacin (700 μg/ml) and ciprofloxacin (12.5 μg/ml). Treatment was continued with H (5 mg/kg/d), R (10 mg/kg/d), Z (30 mg/kg/d), E (15 mg/kg/d), kanamycin (15 mg/kg IM 5 times weekly) and sparfloxacin (500 mg/d) for 18 months with first 2 months under supervision.

His initial lab values were hemoglobin 15.6 g/dl (14–18 g/dl), hematocrit 45.8% (40–54%), sodium 131 mEq/l (135–146 mEq/l), potassium 3.9 mEq/l (3.5–5.5 mEq/l), bicarbonate 24 mEq/l (22–24 mEq/l), chloride 91 mEq/l (95–112 mEq/l), BUN 37 mg/dl (7–25 mg/dl), serum creatinine 1.6 mg/dl (0.7–1.4 mg/dl), and normal liver function tests. He was treated with intravenous fluids, Ciprofloxacin and anti-emetics, to which the diarrhea resolved in 2–3 days. After one month he had recurrent watery diarrhea accompanied with rectal pain, bleeding and vomiting. He also developed fever of 101.6 F.
The physical exam was remarkable for decreased bowel sounds and moderate lower abdominal tenderness. There were no masses or organomegalies palpable. The rectal exam was remarkable for tenderness and heme-positive mucus. The remainder of the physical exam was uneventful. Stool samples from the initial visit were positive for Clostridium difficile cytotoxin, and depicted many WBCs (neutrophils 99% and eosinophils 1%), suggesting an infectious etiology. Stool sample was negative for giardia lamblia, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, aeromonas and plesiomonas. There was no predominance of staphylococcus, yeast, or pseudomonas.
The patient was initially started on Ciprofloxacin (500 mg bid.) for 3 days without symptom resolution. Metronidazole was added (250 mg tid.), but intolerance of the patient to metronidazole with exacerbations of nausea prompted the replacement to Vancomycin (250 mg qid) in conjunction with Ciprofloxacin for 7 days. During this initial treatment period, the patient characteristically developed migratory polyarticular joint pain and swelling involving the shoulders, elbows, fingers, hips and knees. Lack of response to antibiotics suggested an autoimmune disease as a contributing factor.
At this time a sigmoidoscopy and pinch biopsy revealed diffuse acute and chronic inflammation with cryptitis, mucin depletion, and glandular foreshortening and branching suggestive of UC (Fig. ). The patient was treated with Asacol (400 mg bid.) in conjunction with metronidazole (250 mg qid). After 7 days of combined therapy with continued weight loss and no improvement, prednisone (60 mg qid.) was added, resulting in cessation of GI symptoms and moderate improvement in joint pain and swelling. After 7 days of continued improvement, the antibiotic and Asacol therapy were stopped. The patient was maintained on high dose steroids for 14 days. However, fever, gastrointestinal, and joint symptoms recurred upon tapering of prednisone to 20 mg a day. When symptoms recurred, a stool culture was negative for infectious agents including Clostridium difficile antigen, confirming an autoimmune component to disease pathology in this patient. Prednisone was increased to 30 mg per day at which point gastrointestinal symptoms resolved but joint swelling and pain continued. Over the course of 3 months prednisone tapering was attempted three additional times, with each resulting in symptom recurrence.
After 3 months of treatment, the patient experienced an acute dental abscess and was prescribed a combination vancomycin (250 mg tid) and metronidazole (250 mg tid). During this period, the patient was able to gradually reduce prednisone dosage without symptom recurrence. Antibiotics were continued for 30 days during which time prednisone was tapered completely. Symptoms did not recur and the patient remained symptom-free without further therapeutic intervention for 4.5 years.
After this prolonged period of remission of UC symptoms, a second episode similar to the first occurred. The patient once again presented with bloody diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and joint pain. Stool cultures were Clostridium difficile positive by culture and cytotoxin. Once again the patient was treated with 60 mg daily of prednisone and metronidazole (250 mg tid). Symptoms did not resolve, and vancomycin (125 mg tid) was added, resulting in a significant improvement in symptoms. After 2 weeks of combined therapy metronidazole treatment was stopped and symptoms recurred within a week. Metronidazole was once again added, leading to resolution of symptoms. Combined antibiotic and steroid therapy continued for 2 months during which time prednisone was tapered completely and a second remission of UC symptoms was induced.","[[32.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['lower abdominal', 'liver', 'rectal', 'bowel', 'lower abdominal', 'rectal', 'polyarticular joint', 'shoulders', 'elbows', 'fingers', 'hips', 'knees', 'glandular', 'GI', 'joint', 'gastrointestinal', 'joint', 'gastrointestinal', 'joint', 'dental', 'joint']","['nausea', 'vomiting', 'lower abdominal pain', 'diarrhea', 'diarrhea', 'diarrhea', 'rectal pain', 'pain', 'bleeding', 'vomiting', 'fever', 'decreased bowel sounds', 'lower abdominal tenderness', 'masses', 'organomegalies palpable', 'tenderness', 'heme-positive mucus', 'Clostridium difficile cytotoxin', 'infectious etiology', 'giardia lamblia', 'salmonella', 'shigella', 'campylobacter', 'aeromonas', 'plesiomonas', 'staphylococcus', 'yeast', 'pseudomonas', 'symptom', 'nausea', 'migratory polyarticular joint pain', 'swelling', 'Lack of response to antibiotics', 'autoimmune disease', 'inflammation', 'cryptitis', 'mucin depletion', 'glandular foreshortening', 'branching', 'UC', 'weight loss', 'improvement', 'GI symptoms', 'joint pain', 'swelling', 'continued improvement', 'improvement', 'fever', 'joint symptoms', 'symptoms', 'infectious agents', 'Clostridium', 'Clostridium difficile antigen', 'autoimmune component to disease pathology', 'gastrointestinal symptoms', 'swelling', 'pain', 'symptom', 'dental abscess', 'symptom', 'Symptoms', 'symptom-free', 'UC symptoms', 'diarrhea', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'joint pain', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Symptoms', 'symptoms', 'symptoms', 'symptoms', 'UC symptoms']","['fluids', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Metronidazole', 'metronidazole', 'Vancomycin', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Asacol', 'metronidazole', 'prednisone', 'Asacol', 'prednisone', 'Prednisone', 'prednisone', 'vancomycin', 'metronidazole', 'prednisone', 'prednisone', 'prednisone', 'metronidazole', 'vancomycin', 'metronidazole', 'Metronidazole', 'prednisone']",['32'],"['lab', 'hemoglobin', 'hematocrit', 'sodium', 'potassium', 'bicarbonate', 'chloride', 'BUN', 'serum creatinine', 'liver function tests', 'anti-emetics', 'physical exam', 'rectal exam', 'physical exam', 'Stool samples', 'WBCs', 'neutrophils', 'eosinophils', 'Stool sample', 'treatment', 'antibiotics', 'sigmoidoscopy', 'pinch biopsy', 'combined therapy', 'antibiotic', 'Asacol therapy', 'steroids', 'stool culture', 'treatment', 'Antibiotics', 'therapeutic intervention', 'Stool cultures', 'culture', 'cytotoxin', 'combined therapy', 'Combined antibiotic', 'antibiotic', 'steroid therapy']","['2–3 days', 'After one month', '4.5 years', '4.5 years', 'within a week']"

She looked, however, visibly ill and strained -quite unlike a normal happy young woman. She complained of constant headache and pain in her eyes. UG's PTSD diagnosis was confirmed within a two-week period by an expert using the CIDI.
UG did not wait to be offered treatment, but came herself to the project centre and requested for help. In her own words, ""I have been to all the doctors but they have done nothing for me. All they give me are painkillers. I had to drop out of school because of my headaches and pain in my eyes."" When the treatment protocol was explained to her, she was enthusiastic about relating her experiences and readily gave her assent. Her mother was quick to give her consent. She said she would try anything that would help her daughter. In her own words, ' My daughter has not been her real self for a long time.'
At the beginning of NET 1, UG drew a picture of the Somali flag. Asked to explain, she said she loved her homeland and hoped to go back there one day when there was peace. While laying her lifeline, UG included a happy family life in Somalia till the age of 4, her arrival in Uganda after a long and difficult flight itinerary and being accepted as a refugee by the UNHCR as the flowers in her life. The stones in her life represented the worst event, when her older brother was killed, her sister was severely injured and her two younger brothers were lost, never to be seen again, to date. Other stones symbolised flight difficulties such as extreme hunger, and a failure to access a solution for her headaches and eye pain, which she has had since the worst event.
In subsequent NET sessions, UG talked in detail about these events. Excerpts from her story read:
I was born on August 26th 1986 in Mogadishu.... I had six brothers, two younger than me and two sisters older than me. We were a very happy family. As a big family, we conversed a lot and made jokes. We were very happy with our father. He made us laugh and brought us presents whenever he went anywhere. This was a happy time till I was 4 years old...
One day,... we heard guns and bullets firing and we were excited. My father ran from work and picked up the other children from school and came back home with them. Some people came to chase us away from our house because we were a minority clan (Madiban). They were from the Hawie (Habrigidir). They were men, very many. They told us to leave everything and flee from the house. They did not beat us. I was still a child, with a soft head. I heard the bullets and started vomiting and fell down. My mother picked me up and put me on her back. We all left the house...
On the way, we met very many militia men dressed as army men. They told us to lie down on the ground. I was still crying. The rest were silent. One of them knocked me with the butt of the gun on the soft part of my head. Then I kept quiet. They wanted to kill everyone...
They put us in a house for security purposes. A heavy gun was shot near the house. There was another house near our house. They shot this house and the fragments reached our house. Some people were killed in our group, including my brother. He was older than me. He was called Mahad. He was in his school uniform. He fell down on his stomach. I did not see him fall but I saw the blood. My sister Khadija was lying down when the fragments hit her. I did not see any blood, but the fragments went into her stomach and she was hurt in her stomach. My father thought she was dead, but people said she was still alive and she was still talking. He went to her and told her to get up. She could not get up. My father carried her to the hospital. Two of my brothers, Abdirahman aged four years, and Abdirasaq aged three years, disappeared in that group as everyone ran away. They were my two younger brothers. My dead brother Mahad was left there. We never saw my two brothers who disappeared again. So many other people died as well...
After one year, we came back to Mogadishu. We found our father and sister in the hospital. They first stayed in the hospital for some time, then moved to a house. My sister had been operated on. My father had become a bit deaf because of the gunshot.
We decided to leave Somalia and go somewhere else more secure. We left Somalia with nothing. My mother, my father, my injured sister Khadija, and the other six children...
We went to Kampala. My mother was advised to go to the UNHCR and got a mandate. My sister Shamso and my cousin sister Fardosa also got separate mandates.... In 1997, we were resettled in Nakivale camp...
I hit my head down and I felt the pain of the gun again. I was not hurt but I got a terrible headache for three days. I went to the doctor but I did not get any assistance except Panadols and eyedrops. Since then, I was unable to go to school because the headaches increased. My eyes had begun paining from birth, but they increased with the headaches.
I am still here but I hope for a better future and a happier life e.g. to be resettled elsewhere, to have an education, to have a happy family of my own and to make contact with my lost loved ones.
Among her hopes and aspirations for the future, UG hoped to trace her missing brothers under the auspices of the Red Cross, as well as re-enter the education system. She also hoped to one day have a happy family of her own
In the final picture at the end of therapy, she drew a happy family inside a nice house, living in peace.
UG had a CIDI pre-test sum-score of 16; immediately after treatment, this reduced to 12 in the CIDI post-test and 1 at the nine-months follow-up. The nine months follow-up found UG no longer in the camp but in Kampala, the capital city of Uganda. She looked happy and cared about her appearance. She said she had no more headaches, and little eye problems. In her own words, ""I feel like a newborn child,"" she told the blind evaluator. She had moved away from the camp to explore possibilities for further education, resettlement and to seriously try to trace her brothers. She also reported joining other adolescents when they were out to socialize. ""My biggest dream is to play soccer myself, but as a girl, I would never be allowed. But at least I go and cheer to the boys when they play."" She says her family members, especially her mother, have all noticed the difference in her and keep commenting on the improvements she has made. She is more like any healthy young woman.","[[17.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['eyes', 'eyes', 'eye', 'head', 'soft part of my head', 'stomach', 'stomach', 'stomach', 'head', 'eyes', 'eye']","['ill', 'strained', 'headache', 'pain', 'PTSD', 'headaches', 'pain', 'stones', 'killed', 'injured', 'stones', 'flight difficulties', 'hunger', 'failure to access a solution', 'headaches', 'eye pain', 'beat', 'soft head', 'vomiting', 'fell down', 'knocked me with the butt of the gun on the soft part of my head', 'fell down', 'fall', 'blood', 'fragments hit', 'blood', 'fragments went into her stomach', 'hurt', 'dead', 'still alive', 'still talking', 'could not get up.', 'disappeared', 'dead', 'disappeared', 'died', 'deaf', 'gunshot', 'injured', 'hit my head down', 'pain', 'hurt', 'headache', 'headaches', 'paining', 'headaches', 'looked happy', 'cared about her appearance', 'headaches', 'eye problems', 'improvements']",['Panadols'],"['March 2003', 'project centre', 'Somalia till', '4', 'Uganda', 'flight itinerary', 'refugee', 'UNHCR', 'flowers', 'August 26th 1986', 'Mogadishu', '4', 'school', 'Madiban', 'Hawie', 'Habrigidir', 'security purposes', 'Mahad', 'Khadija', 'Abdirahman', 'Abdirasaq', 'Mahad', 'Mogadishu', 'Khadija', 'Kampala', 'UNHCR', 'Shamso', 'Fardosa', '1997', 'Nakivale camp', 'Red Cross', 'peace', 'Kampala', 'capital city of Uganda', 'camp', 'play soccer myself', 'girl']","['treatment', 'painkillers', 'treatment protocol', 'NET sessions', 'operated', 'eyedrops', 'therapy', 'CIDI pre-test sum-score', 'treatment', 'CIDI', 'CIDI post-test']","['two-week period', 'three days', 'post-test']"

Vigia del Fuerte is a highly endemic malaria region located in the Atrato River basin with a mean Annual Parasite Index (API) of 72.6 during the past five years. The patient presented 15 days with fever, headache, chills, jaundice, arthralgia, melena, dark urine and bilious vomiting. He was given a heparin lock for administration of I.V. treatment. The patient deteriorated throughout the night and died before thick smear results were available.

Physical examination showed a 14 × 10 cm mass palpable in epigastrium and left hypochondrium with minimal intrinsic mobility.
Routine biochemical investigations were normal. Ultrasonogram and CT-scan of the abdomen showed large heterogeneous mass of 13 × 10 cm extending from the tail of pancreas to anterior pararenal space, lesser sac to gastrosplenic ligament enveloping the posterior aspect of fundus, body and greater curvature (Figure ). One day after the admission, examination showed reduction in the size of palpable mass to 8 × 6 cm size which was not associated with aggravation of the symptoms. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was repeated which showed reduction in the diameter of mass to 8 × 8 cm. Upper endoscopy showed large bulge in fundus and corpus of the stomach posteriorly with an opening in the posterior part of the corpus with edematous margin with dissemination of serous fluid and necrotic material in to the stomach (Figure ). Fluid analysis was normal for CEA and CA 19-9.

She was previously healthy and was not taking any regular medications. There was no history of peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, trauma or previous abdominal surgery. She had been investigated two years previously by a gastroenterologist for intermittent left-sided abdominal pain at which time the clinical examination and blood tests were normal. Irritable bowel syndrome had been diagnosed, although no colonic imaging was performed. Both her maternal grandfather and great-grandfather had suffered from colonic cancer.
An initial ultrasound scan of the abdomen revealed thickened bowel in the right upper quadrant with a dilated duodenum. A barium meal and follow through was then performed: this demonstrated a mucosal abnormality on the greater curvature of the stomach with a fistulous tract into the transverse colon (Figure ). Barium enema and colonoscopy were not performed. The presence of a mucosal abnormality on the greater curvature of the stomach was confirmed on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy although initial biopsies revealed no evidence of a malignant neoplasm. Her blood tests revealed: haemoglobin 9.5 g/dl, mean cell volume 71.6 fl and a white cell count 20.2 × 109/l; urea, electrolytes and liver function tests were all normal.
In view of her symptoms, an exploratory laparotomy was undertaken. At surgery, a large mobile tumour of the distal transverse colon was identified; this was adherent to the greater curvature of the stomach, the mesentery and to several loops of jejunum. A radical en-bloc resection was performed involving a subtotal gastrectomy, transverse colectomy and small bowel resection (Figure ). The patient made an uneventful recovery from surgery. Histology revealed a poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of colon without lymphatic involvement (Dukes' Stage B): this was adherent to and had penetrated the stomach wall. She received adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (420 mg/m2) and folinic acid (20 mg/m2) chemotherapy every four weeks for the following six months.

The overlying skin appeared normal without ulceration (Figure ), and there was no inguinal lymphadenopathy. Computed tomography depicted a solid tumor with heterogeneous contrast enhancement in the adipose tissue, and no metastases to the liver and lung (Figure ). With a tentative diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma of unknown origin, a wide local excision (with a resection margin ≥ 20 mm) was performed.
The resected tumor, measuring 124 × 105 mm, was solid, encapsulated, and a homogeneous yellowish white in color, without central necrosis and hemorrhage on its cut surface. Routine histological examination with hematoxylin-and-eosin revealed that the tumor comprised spindle-shaped cells with high cellularity in parts (Figure ) and two mitoses per 10 high-power fields.

At that time the tumour was found to be poorly differentiated with evidence of local nodal spread. He had been reviewed regularly by the oncologists and remained asymptomatic until the onset of frank haematuria.
He subsequently underwent cystoscopy, which revealed a solid bladder tumour on the right lateral wall, which was treated with trans-urethral resection. Pathological examination confirmed a poorly differentiated mucus-secreting adenocarcinoma, identical histologically to the original oesophageal tumour (Figures and ).
A diagnosis of metastatic oesophageal adenocarcinoma to the bladder was made. A CT scan did not demonstrate any pelvic tumour outside the bladder and therefore metastasis by the trans-coelomic route was essentially excluded, indicating haematogenous spread of the primary oesophageal carcinoma.

Prodromal signs of anaphylaxis (flushing, pruritus, warmth, urticaria) reportedly occurred about 15 minutes before the onset of symptoms from other systems. Ten days earlier the patient, an asthmatic since childhood, had completed a 4-day course of amoxycillin (500 mg TID) without any side effects. Apart from obesity, there were no other risk factors for coronary artery disease.
On admission the patient was in acute distress. He was complaining of dizziness, blurred vision, dyspnea and abdominal pain. Initial examination revealed an obese man (Weight = 130 kg, Body Mass Index = 38 kg/m2) with generalized erythema, angioedema, cyanosis and diffuse wheezing; the systolic blood pressure was 70 mmHg and the pulse rate 120 bpm. The patient was then connected to a cardiac monitor, which showed sinus tachycardia (approximately 140 bpm) without ST-segment and T wave abnormalities (Fig. ). Pulse oxymetry demonstrated an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 90%.
Epinephrine (0.3 mg or 0.3 ml of a dilution 1:1000) was injected subcutaneously (SC); dimethindene (4 mg) and hydrocortizone (500 mg) were administered intravenously (IV) in slow infusion. Nebulized salbutamol and supplemental oxygen were given as well. Normal saline with 50 mg ranitidine hydrochloride and Ringer's solution were infused through separate intravenous lines.
Due to unsatisfactory clinical response (persistence of hypotension and tachycardia, despite improvement of the pulmonary signs) a second dose of epinephrine (0.2 mg) was given SC 20 minutes later. Almost simultaneously with the administration of the second dose of epinephrine, ST-segment elevation appeared on the monitor (Fig. ) and the patient complained of substernal chest pain. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and V3 to V6 (Fig. ). A single dose of 325 mg acetylsalicylic acid was given per os; heparin (5000 UI) and pethidine hydrochloride (25 mg) were administered IV. An hour later the patient was hemodynamically stable. The arterial blood pressure was 125/90 mmHg and SpO2 rose to 96%. However, the chest pain persisted and nitroglycerin titrated at a dose of 25 μg/min was infused IV, without complete symptom relief. At this point the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) of the nearest general hospital.
Treatment in the CCU included thrombolysis with reteplase – administered according to the standard protocol – 2 hours after the onset of chest discomfort, which according to the established clinical and electrocardiographic criteria was considered successful []. The peak levels of serum troponin I and creatine phosphokinase were 45.5 ng/ml (normal = 0–2 ng/ml) and 575 U/L (normal = 25–195 U/L), respectively; while the MB fraction was 77 U/L (normal = 0–24 U/L). The rest of the laboratory results, including serum cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Lpa and triglycerides, were within normal limits. An ECG performed before discharge showed complete loss of potentials in leads III and aVF and partial loss of potentials with a small q wave in lead II (Fig. ). An echocardiographic study performed on the 5th hospital day showed preserved systolic function (ejection fraction 60%) without wall motion abnormalities. Left (Fig. ) and right (Fig. ) coronary angiography showed no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease; left ventriculography was normal as well. The patient recovered completely and was discharged a week after admission. He was referred to the adult Allergology Center of our area performing diagnostic work up for drug allergy.
Prick skin tests (PST) were performed using penicilloyl polylysine (PPL), and minor determinant mixute (MDM) [supplied as Allergopen by Allergopharma (Reinbeck, Germany)]; amoxycillin, ampicillin and cefamandole solutions were also used (concentration 20 mg/ml) for PST. PST were strongly positive [4+ reaction (on a scale of 1–4) i.e. wheal >5 mm in diameter with pseudopodes, with no reaction at all to the diluent control] to amoxycillin and ampicillin. Intradermal tests were performed only to PPL, MDM (dilution 1/10) and cefamandole (0.2 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml) and resulted in strongly positive reaction (4+) only to the MDM. Circulating specific IgE to penicillin V, penicillin G, amoxycillin, ampicillin and cefaclor was not demonstrable by CAP (Pharmacia, Sweden).","[[32.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['coronary artery', 'abdominal', 'cardiac', 'pulmonary', 'substernal chest', 'chest', 'arterial', 'chest', 'chest', 'wall', 'coronary', 'coronary artery', 'skin']","['anaphylaxis', 'ingestion of amoxycillin', 'Prodromal signs of anaphylaxis', 'anaphylaxis', 'flushing', 'pruritus', 'warmth', 'urticaria', 'symptoms', 'asthmatic', 'side effects', 'obesity', 'coronary artery disease', 'acute distress', 'dizziness', 'blurred vision', 'dyspnea', 'abdominal pain', 'obese', 'generalized erythema', 'angioedema', 'cyanosis', 'wheezing', 'sinus tachycardia', 'ST-segment and T wave abnormalities', 'hypotension', 'tachycardia', 'pulmonary signs', 'ST-segment elevation', 'substernal chest pain', 'chest pain', 'ST segment elevation', 'ST segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and V3 to V6', 'hemodynamically stable', 'chest pain', 'complete symptom relief', 'chest discomfort', 'complete loss of potentials in leads III and aVF', 'partial loss of potentials', 'q wave in lead II', 'preserved', 'preserved systolic function', 'wall motion abnormalities', 'obstructive coronary artery disease', 'recovered completely', 'reaction', 'wheal', 'pseudopodes', 'reaction', 'strongly positive reaction', 'Circulating specific IgE to penicillin V, penicillin G, amoxycillin, ampicillin and cefaclor']","['amoxycillin', 'amoxycillin', 'Epinephrine', 'dimethindene', 'hydrocortizone', 'salbutamol', 'Normal saline', 'ranitidine hydrochloride', ""Ringer's solution"", 'epinephrine', 'epinephrine', 'acetylsalicylic acid', 'heparin', 'pethidine hydrochloride', 'nitroglycerin', 'reteplase', 'penicilloyl polylysine', 'PPL', 'amoxycillin', 'ampicillin', 'cefamandole', 'amoxycillin', 'ampicillin', 'PPL', 'MDM', 'cefamandole', 'penicillin V', 'penicillin G', 'amoxycillin', 'ampicillin', 'cefaclor']","['32', 'emergency room', 'CCU', 'CCU', '5th hospital', 'Allergology Center', 'Germany']","['examination', 'Weight', 'Body', 'Body Mass Index', 'systolic blood pressure', 'pulse rate', 'cardiac monitor', 'Pulse oxymetry', 'oxygen saturation', 'SpO2', 'supplemental oxygen', '12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)', 'arterial blood pressure', 'SpO2', 'thrombolysis', 'electrocardiographic', 'peak levels of serum troponin I', 'creatine phosphokinase', 'MB fraction', 'laboratory', 'serum cholesterol', 'LDL', 'HDL', 'Lpa', 'triglycerides', 'ECG', 'echocardiographic study', 'ejection fraction', 'coronary angiography', 'left ventriculography', 'diagnostic work up', 'Prick skin tests', 'PST', 'PST', 'PST', 'reaction', 'Intradermal tests']","['2 hours and 15 minutes', 'Ten days earlier', 'since childhood', '5th hospital day']"

The preprocedural TEE described an aneurysm of the IAS (See : TEE.mpeg for the TEE), however the left heart catheterization was deemed feasible. ICE performed at the electrophysiology laboratory (catheter Ultra ICE 9900, 9 MHz, EP Technologies, Boston Scientific Corp., San Jose, CA, USA connected to a console ClearView Ultra, Boston Scientific Corp., San Jose, CA, USA) as a routine part of the transseptal puncture showed more detailed picture of the intracardiac anatomy – dilated aortic root, enlarged right atrium displacing the IAS towards the LA free wall, and small oval fossa with flapping motion of the fossa ovalis membrane. The distance between the IAS and the LA free wall during the atrial diastole was small (Fig. ). During the atrial contraction the LA cavity appeared almost obliterated and the fossa ovalis membrane virtually touched the LA free wall, thus making the transseptal puncture potentially dangerous (Fig. ) (See : ICE1.mpeg for the unusual intracardiac anatomy). The fossa itself was abouting anteriorly to the non-coronary aortic sinus of Valsalva and although the fluoroscopic position of the transseptal needle was apparently correct, ICE showed that it was always sliding to the junction between the IAS and the aorta and that the needle tip was pointing towards the aortic root. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to change its direction towards the oval fossa. That was also deemed a condition predisposing to complicated transseptal puncture (Fig. ) (See : ICE2.mpeg for the sliding of the transseptal needle towards the aorta). During the procedure two echocardiographers, including the one, which had performed the TEE, re-evaluated the videotaped TEE and agreement was achieved that the initial interpretation of the TEE needed correction. Although the patient was symptomatic and the arrhythmia episodes could not be suppressed effectively with antiarrhythmic drugs, after considering all pros and cons we decided not to perform the left atrial procedure and thus to avoid serious and potentially fatal complications. Only a cavotricuspid isthmus ablation was done.","[[70.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['atrial', 'atrial', 'arterial', 'LA', 'IAS', 'left heart', 'transseptal', 'intracardiac anatomy', 'aortic root', 'right atrium', 'IAS towards the LA free wall', 'small oval fossa', 'fossa ovalis membrane', 'IAS', 'LA free wall', 'atrial', 'atrial', 'LA cavity', 'fossa ovalis membrane', 'LA free wall', 'transseptal', 'intracardiac', 'intracardiac anatomy', 'fossa', 'non-coronary aortic sinus of Valsalva', 'junction between the IAS', 'junction between the IAS and the aorta', 'aortic root', 'oval fossa', 'aorta', 'left atrial', 'cavotricuspid isthmus']","['paroxysmal atrial fibrillation', 'atrial flutter', 'arterial hypertension', 'aneurysm of the IAS', 'dilated aortic root', 'enlarged right atrium', 'displacing the IAS towards the LA free wall', 'flapping motion of the fossa ovalis membrane', 'distance between the IAS and the LA free wall', 'atrial diastole', 'atrial contraction', 'LA cavity appeared almost obliterated', 'fossa ovalis membrane virtually touched the LA free wall', 'transseptal puncture potentially dangerous', 'fossa itself was abouting anteriorly to the non-coronary aortic sinus of Valsalva', 'sliding to the junction between the IAS and the aorta', 'needle tip was pointing towards the aortic root', 'symptomatic', 'arrhythmia episodes', 'fatal complications']",[],"['Boston Scientific Corp', 'San Jose', 'Boston Scientific Corp', 'San Jose']","['LA circumferential ablation', 'TEE', 'TEE', 'mpeg', 'TEE', 'left heart catheterization', 'ICE', 'transseptal puncture', 'ICE1', 'mpeg', 'ICE', 'complicated transseptal puncture', 'TEE', 'videotaped TEE', 'TEE', 'antiarrhythmic drugs', 'left atrial procedure', 'cavotricuspid isthmus ablation']",['preprocedural']

During the preliminary consultation, she also complained of right upper quadrant pain, which radiated to her right lower quadrant and upper back. She underwent upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy which demonstrated a 3 cm, ulcerated, ampullary mass (figure ). Endoscopic biopsies suggested the diagnosis of paraganglioma. The lesion did not obstruct the ampullary orifice. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen failed to demonstrate this lesion or any additional abnormalities.
The patient underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy and lymph node dissection. The postoperative course was uneventful except for delayed gastric emptying diagnosed by frequent vomiting during postoperative days 7 to 10, and confirmed by gastrograffin swallow. These symptoms eventually resolved with conservative management and the patient was discharged from the hospital on 15th postoperative day.
Gross pathological evaluation of the resected specimen included a portion of duodenum with ampulla, measuring 16 cm. in length, and a portion of pancreatic head measuring 5 cm. in length. There was a polypoid periampullary mass protruding into the duodenal lumen, measuring 1.4 × 1.2 × 0.7 cm. On cut section, the mass was moderately firm and pink-tan. It was circumscribed but unencapsulated, and appeared to be covered by normal appearing duodenal mucosa. There was no evidence of pancreatic invasion by the tumor. A total of seven lymph nodes were also removed, 5 peripancreatic (3.0 cm in greatest dimension) and 2 periduodenal (1.2 cm and 1.0 cm in greatest dimension, respectively).
Histologically, the tumor consisted of a complex neoplastic proliferation that included a component resembling carcinoid or islet cell tumor (figure ), admixed with a proliferation of spindled neurofibrillary cells and larger polygonal cells demonstrating gangliocytic differentiation (figures and ). There were areas of stromal hyalinization resembling amyloid, with focal calcification (figure ). Congo red and Thioflavin T stains were negative for amyloid. The tumor extended through the muscularis propria and along the common bile duct, but did not invade the pancreas. The resection margins were free of tumor. Metastatic paraganglioma was present in 6 of 7 periduodenal and peripancreatic lymph nodes. The metastatic lymph nodes showed the same mixed histologic features as the primary tumor.
Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the tumor stained positively for S-100, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and cytokeratin AE1 and AE3. No reactivity was observed with MART-1 or HMB 45. Staining for c-kit (CD 117) was performed on sections of the primary tumor and of one of the lymph nodes with metastatic tumor. The carcinoid-like epithelial cells and the spindle-shaped neurofibrillar cells stained negatively for the cell marker c-Kit. The gangliocytic cells stained strongly positive for c-kit.
Due to the evidence of regional lymph node metastasis the patient was counseled regarding adjuvant therapeutic options. The treating physicians queried recognized experts in the field of radiation therapy for gastrointestinal malignancies via email and a consensus developed that external beam radiation therapy might be reasonable, although it was admitted that no data are available regarding the use of this modality for this disease entity. Ultimately, a decision was made to administer external beam radiotherapy to the abdomen in an effort to eradicate any possible residual disease not removed during surgery and to reduce the risk of locally recurrent disease. No chemotherapy was advised due to the rarity of distant metastases and the lack of response of these neoplasms to conventional systemic therapy.
The patient was treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy in 28 fractions of 180 cGy/fraction over 37 elapsed days; 6 mv photon beam energy was used. The target was a postoperative tumor bed with a 5–10 mm margin. The total dose was 5,040 cGy. She tolerated treatment well and is now symptom free more than one year following resection. Surveillance CT scans and endoscopy have been performed both of which reveal no evidence of recurrent disease.","[[49.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['right upper quadrant', 'right lower quadrant', 'upper back', 'upper gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal', 'GI', 'GI', 'ampullary', 'ampullary orifice', 'abdomen', 'pylorus-preserving', 'lymph node', 'gastric', 'gastrograffin', 'portion of duodenum with ampulla', 'portion of pancreatic head', 'periampullary', 'duodenal lumen', 'duodenal mucosa', 'pancreatic', 'lymph nodes', 'peripancreatic', '2 periduodenal', 'periduodenal', 'spindled neurofibrillary cells', 'polygonal cells', 'muscularis propria', 'common bile duct', 'pancreas', 'resection margins', '6 of 7 periduodenal and peripancreatic lymph nodes', 'lymph nodes', 'lymph nodes', 'regional lymph node', 'gastrointestinal', 'abdomen']","['melena', 'right upper quadrant pain', 'ulcerated', 'ampullary mass', 'paraganglioma', 'lesion', 'obstruct the ampullary orifice', 'lesion', 'abnormalities', 'delayed gastric emptying', 'vomiting', 'symptoms', 'polypoid periampullary mass', 'mass', 'normal appearing duodenal mucosa', 'pancreatic invasion by the tumor', 'tumor', 'neoplastic proliferation', 'carcinoid', 'islet cell tumor', 'proliferation of spindled neurofibrillary cells', 'polygonal cells', 'gangliocytic differentiation', 'areas of stromal hyalinization', 'amyloid', 'focal calcification', 'amyloid', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'Metastatic paraganglioma', 'metastatic lymph nodes', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'primary tumor', 'metastatic tumor', 'carcinoid-like epithelial cells', 'spindle-shaped neurofibrillar cells', 'gangliocytic cells', 'regional lymph node metastasis', 'gastrointestinal malignancies', 'residual disease', 'disease', 'metastases', 'lack of response of these neoplasms', 'tolerated treatment well', 'symptom', 'disease']",[],"['49', '15th']","['upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy', 'endoscopy', 'Endoscopic biopsies', 'computed tomography (CT)', 'magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen', 'MRI', 'pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy', 'lymph node dissection', 'gastrograffin swallow', 'conservative management', 'Gross pathological evaluation', 'resected specimen', 'cut section', 'total of seven lymph nodes were also removed', 'Congo red and Thioflavin T stains', 'Immunohistochemical analysis', 'S-100', 'chromogranin', 'synaptophysin', 'cytokeratin AE1 and AE3', 'MART-1', 'HMB', 'HMB 45', 'Staining for c-kit', 'Staining for c-kit (CD 117)', 'cell marker c-Kit', 'marker c-Kit', 'c-kit', 'adjuvant therapeutic', 'radiation therapy', 'external beam radiation therapy', 'external beam radiotherapy', 'surgery', 'chemotherapy', 'conventional systemic therapy', 'intensity-modulated radiotherapy', 'resection', 'CT scans', 'endoscopy']","['6-month', 'postoperative days 7 to 10', 'more than one year']"
104,555544-1,15745454,oa_comm/PMC000xxxxxx/PMC555544.xml,A case of invasive aspergillosis in CGD patient successfully treated with Amphotericin B and INF-γ,"A 5-year-old male patient was admitted to Children Medical Center (CMC) with inflammation and swelling in his left mandible and wrist without a history of trauma. In the past, he had suffered from several episodes of pneumonia which started at the age of seven months. On admission, laboratory findings included erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 84 mm/h, WBC count 12100/mm3 (61% neutrophils, 39% lymphocytes), hemoglobin 11.3 gr/dl and thrombocyte 386000/mm3. As the CRP analysis displayed 20 mg/dl, cephalexin (150 mg/kg/day) was initiated. In his roentgenogram, osteolytic lesions in the distal metaphase of hand and maxillary bone were observed. Considering history of several infections and multifocal osteomyelitis, bone biopsy was performed and his immune system function was evaluated. In the bone biopsy, non-necrotizing granulomatoid lesions were seen. The induration of purified protein derivative reaction was 10 mm diameter. Besides, HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs), rheumatoid factor and brucella agglutination tests were all negative. The serum IgG level was 1650 mg/dl (normal: 441–1135 mg/dl). IgM and IgA were in high normal range at 250 and 175 mg/dl, respectively. Because no defect was found in his humeral and cellular immunity, the phagocytic cells function was tested with a nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) slide test. Based on his hematological and immunological tests (NBT = 0), CGD was considered as underlying disease in this case. Regarding his NBT test, antibiotic therapy was changed from cephalexin to co-trimoxazole (20 mg/kg/day, iv) plus (along with) interferon-γ (50 microgram/m2 every other day). After two weeks of treatment, the patient's condition improved and he was discharged with prescription of both cephalexin (100 mg/kg/day) and co-trimoxazole (10 mg/kg/day) to be taken orally as prophylaxis.
The patient was readmitted to our center after eight months with a tender mass in his right upper quadrant (RUQ) (Fig ). On admission, his major complaint was severe dyspnea, a persistent cough and also chest and abdominal pain in epigastric area which was started 10 days ago. He was placed on antibiotic therapy including cephalexin (100 mg/kg/day). A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen was performed which revealed the hypodense area in liver (Fig ). Adjacent to this opacity, involvement of lower right ribs and reaction to soft tissue were also observed, indicating ribs osteomyelitis. After sonography guided drainage of the above-mentioned hepatic abscess, a sample was sent to the Mycology Department in Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The microscopic examination of clarified specimen with KOH 10% indicated the branched, septated and dichotomous mycelia (Fig. ). The remaining specimen was also cultured on Brain Heart Infusion agar (BHI), Sabouraud's dextrose agar (S) and Sabouraud's containing 0.005% chloramphenicol (Sc). The S and Sc culture media were incubated at 25°C and BHI at 37°C. The colonies grew rapidly, attaining the diameter of 5 cm within 5 days and their color was bluish green. Cellophane tape preparations and slide cultures demonstrated septated, branched and hyaline hyphae with rough-walled conidiophores and radiated conidial heads. Based on these microscopic and macroscopic findings, Aspergillus fumigatus was determined as causative agent in this case. Deoxycholate Amphotericin B (1 mg/kg/day, iv), interferon-γ (50 microgeram/m2 every other day, sc) and rifampicin (10 mg/kg/day) were administered with diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. The only adverse event observed during treatment was hypokalemia, which was adjusted by administration of potassium chloride 15%. One month after initiation of antifungal therapy, his follow-up CT scan of the abdominal and thoracal region demonstrated relative resolution of hepatic abscess. After four weeks of intravenous treatment, the patient's clinical condition improved. He was discharged upon his parents' responsibility while continuing taking rifampicin (10 mg/kg/day) for two more weeks as a treatment in addition to co-trimoxazole (5 mg/kg/day) and itraconazole (4 mg/kg/day) as long term prophylaxis.","[[5.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['left mandible', 'wrist', 'distal metaphase of hand', 'maxillary bone', 'bone', 'immune system', 'bone', 'humeral', 'cellular', 'right upper quadrant', 'RUQ', 'chest', 'abdominal', 'epigastric area', 'chest', 'abdomen', 'liver', 'lower right ribs', 'soft tissue', 'ribs', 'hepatic', 'Brain', 'Heart', 'abdominal', 'thoracal region', 'hepatic']","['inflammation', 'swelling', 'trauma', 'pneumonia', 'osteolytic lesions', 'infections', 'osteomyelitis', 'granulomatoid lesions', 'induration of purified protein derivative reaction', 'defect', 'CGD', 'condition improved', 'mass', 'dyspnea', 'cough', 'pain', 'hypodense area', 'opacity', 'reaction to soft tissue', 'ribs osteomyelitis', 'hepatic abscess', 'mycelia', 'colonies grew rapidly', 'septated', 'branched', 'hyaline hyphae', 'rough-walled conidiophores', 'radiated conidial heads', 'Aspergillus fumigatus', 'invasive aspergillosis', 'adverse event', 'hypokalemia', 'hepatic abscess', 'clinical condition improved']","['cephalexin', 'cephalexin', 'co-trimoxazole', 'interferon', 'cephalexin', 'co-trimoxazole', 'cephalexin', 'chloramphenicol', 'Deoxycholate Amphotericin B', 'interferon-', 'rifampicin', 'potassium chloride', 'rifampicin', 'co-trimoxazole', 'itraconazole']","['5', 'Children Medical Center', 'Mycology Department', 'Tehran University']","['laboratory', 'erythrocyte sedimentation rate', 'ESR', 'WBC count', 'neutrophils', 'lymphocytes', 'hemoglobin', 'thrombocyte', 'CRP analysis', 'roentgenogram', 'bone biopsy', 'immune system function', 'bone biopsy', 'HIV', 'hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs)', 'rheumatoid factor', 'brucella agglutination tests', 'serum IgG level', 'IgM', 'IgA', 'cellular immunity', 'phagocytic cells function', 'nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) slide test', 'hematological and immunological tests', 'NBT', 'NBT test', 'antibiotic therapy', 'treatment', 'prophylaxis', 'antibiotic therapy', 'computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen', 'sonography guided drainage', 'microscopic examination', 'KOH', 'Brain Heart Infusion agar (BHI)', ""Sabouraud's dextrose"", ""Sabouraud's dextrose agar (S)"", ""Sabouraud's containing 0.005% chloramphenicol (Sc)"", 'S and Sc culture media', 'BHI', 'slide cultures', 'microscopic and macroscopic', 'treatment', 'antifungal therapy', 'CT scan of the abdominal and thoracal region', 'treatment', 'prophylaxis']","['seven months', 'eight months', '10 days ago', '10 days ago', 'within 5 days']"

Examination revealed left eye blindness with primary optic atrophy and no other neurological deficit. Imaging revealed a bony tumor in the left ethmoid sinus invading the left orbit and compressing the left optic nerve. Intracranial extension into the anterior cranial fossa on the left side was noted (Figure ). Core biopsy of the mass showed an osteoid osteoma.
A multispeciality team approach was devised to achieve radical excision of the tumor. Bicoronal scalp flap and pericranial flaps were raised separately. A single burr hole left fronto orbital bone flap was raised including the orbital roof and left zygomaticofrontal process (Figure ). Dura was retracted and the bony hard whitish tumor visualised. This was excised using the high speed drill (Figure ). Weber Ferguson incision was used to access the orbital portion of the tumor. Medially the tumor could be felt in the orbit but retraction of the globe was difficult. Hence inferior orbitotomy was done by removing the lower and lateral orbital margins. The intraorbital contents could now be retracted laterally and the tumor visualized (Figure ). The tumor was then detached from the ethmoid sinus and the intraorbital extension excised. The ethmoidal portion was drilled and radical excision achieved (Figure ). Dural tears were covered with temporalis fascia and glue. The ethmoidal sinus was packed with free temporalis muscle graft. Vascularised pericranial graft was used to cover the anterior skull base. The frontal sinus was exenterated and packed with gelfoam. The bone flap and orbital margins were replaced.
Post-operatively patient had a frozen left eye (possibly due to retraction of the orbital contents) with no improvement in the left eye vision in the immediate postoperative period.

This was associated with nausea and loss of appetite, made worse by movement and not relieved with intramuscular morphine injection. There was no history of recent or past trauma to the chest or abdomen. On examination, she was tender in the right upper quadrant and right iliac fossa with rebound and guarding, with a Rovsing positive sign and normal bowel sounds. She was incidentally found to have some marfanoid features including the long span of upper limbs, a high arched palate and the very soft early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation. The patient had a positive family history of Marfan's syndrome but had never undergone genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis.
A likely diagnosis of appendicitis was made on the clinical picture associated with a pyrexia and raised white cell count and C – reactive protein. Her abdominal X-ray at that time showed absence of gas in the right side of her bowel. Her chest X-ray did not show any obvious abnormality (Figure )
She was taken to theatre the same day for appendicectomy through a standard right iliac fossa incision. There was a small amount of free fluid but the right iliac fossa was filled with a normal looking gall bladder and small bowel only with no sign of the caecum, appendix, ascending or proximal transverse colon. The terminal ileum was found to run up under the right lobe of the liver towards the hilum. The right iliac fossa wound was closed and we proceeded to an exploratory laparoscopy.
At laparoscopy, the liver was retracted to see under the right liver lobe. The proximal transverse colon was found to be running up towards the liver hilum were it felt to be tethered. This suggested a possible herniation of the right colon into the chest. The procedure was abandoned and a CT thorax and abdomen were performed to define the anatomy involved.
This (Figure , ) demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions of moderate size with underlying unexpanded lungs. The liver had what appeared to be a large Reidl's lobe. Behind the right liver lobe, the right kidney was markedly elevated and the ileo-caecal junction appeared to lie between the liver and the kidney. The right side of the colon appeared to lie above the liver. Three dimensional reconstruction of the scans demonstrated absence of the right hemidiaphragm. (Figure , )
The symptoms and signs persisted and a laparotomy was performed. At laparotomy, there was some free fluid. There was definitely a large defect in the right hemidiaphragm. The right liver lobe had grown right up into the right intrathoracic space. There was a large hernial sac beneath the right lobe of the liver between the common bile duct, duodenum and liver, displacing the right kidney medially and containing transverse colon, terminal ileum, caecum, appendix and free fluid. The contents of this sac were successfully reduced and a perforated gangrenous appendix with pus was found within the intrathoracic hernial sac. A standard appendicectomy was performed. The right colon was formally mobilized, fully reduced and the caecum was fixed within the right iliac fossa.

She had vomited a number of times. In the previous week she had two episodes of a similar nature.
On examination there was no jaundice or pyrexia. The apex beat was in the right fifth intercostal space, midclavicular line. She had epigastric tenderness but was not tender in the right or left upper quadrants. Her white cell count and amylase level was normal but her C-reactive protein level (CRP) was elevated at 290 mg/L. An electrocardiograph showed right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy, in keeping with dextrocardia.
An ultrasound scan of the upper abdomen identified the gallbladder, which contained stones, in the left upper quadrant. The spleen was visualised in the right upper quadrant. There was no evidence of common bile duct or intrahepatic duct dilatation. Chest X-Ray confirmed the clinical and electrocardiograph diagnosis of dextrocardia.
The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and situs inversus was made. The patient settled clinically over two to three days and was discharged home to be admitted electively for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
In order to conduct the laparoscopic cholecystectomy all theatre equipment including diathermy, monitors and CO2 insufflator were positioned in the mirror image of their normal position. The surgical team also changed sides with the primary surgeon and first assistant on the patients right and the second assistant on the left. The ports were inserted in the usual way but on the left side. At laparoscopy the entirety of the abdominal contents were indeed reversed.
The main difficulty encountered was that the primary surgeon, who was right handed, would have had to cross hands to retract on Hartmann's pouch while dissecting Calot's triangle. We overcame this difficulty by allowing the first assistant to retract on Hartmann's pouch, while the primary surgeon dissected Calot's triangle using his right hand via the epigastric port without hindrance. The common bile duct and cystic duct were identified, as was the cystic artery, which lay anterior to the cystic duct.

111,1065068-1,15566596,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1065068.xml,Case report: Greater meningeal inflammation in lumbar than in ventricular region in human bacterial meningitis,"A 20-year-old Caucasian man with no medical history was admitted for elective surgery of a chordoma that extended from the sphenoidal sinus to the anterior face of C2. The first surgical step consisted of a subtotal removal of the tumour by a transfrontal approach. An EVD was inserted at day 1 (D1) because of the appearance of hydrocephalia.
At D10, the second approach consisted in a transoral resection of the tumour with a reconstruction of the pharyngeal wall with skin taken from the arm. However, the wall was not totally occlusive, with a continuous CSF leak into the pharyngeal cavity. Seven days later (D17), the patient developed meningitis with fever and a white blood cell count of 13,800/mm3. CSF withdrawn through the ventricular drain showed CSF leukocytes at 830/mm3, a CSF protein concentration of 0.99 g/l and a CSF glucose concentration of 3 mmol/l (for a glycaemia of 6 mmol/l). A Ps. aeruginosa O12 resistant to almost all antibiotics except ceftazidime and polymyxin B, similar to that repeatedly found in the oral cavity, grew in CSF culture. It was therefore decided to replace the ventricular drain with another in the controlateral hemisphere for two purposes: first, to withdraw CSF to reduce CSF leakage by the fistula, and second, to perform a biochemical and bacteriological analysis. Antibiotherapy was started with intravenous (i.v.) ceftazidime (6 g/day for 2 days, followed by 8 g/day for 25 days) combined with amikacin and polymyxin B both in the ventricles.
A clear improvement in the meningitis allowed us to perform the third and last approach (at D42): an occipito-cervical fixation procedure with EVD removed. Three days later (D45), the patient developed a new episode of hydrocephalia. It was therefore decided to introduce ELD rather than EVD.
Twelve days later (D57), the patient developed a second episode of meningitis: fever, lumbar CSF leukocytes at 14,000/mm3, a CSF protein concentration of 1.88 g/l and a glucose concentration of 0.9 mmol/l (for a glycaemia of 6 mmol/l). A CSF culture found the same bacteria as in the first episode of meningitis. This second episode was considered to be related to the persistent pharyngeal fistula. The ELD was replaced with a new one and EVD was added because of the suspicion of an additional obstruction in the 4th ventricle related to post-surgical oedema. Meningitis was treated with an increasing dose of i.v. ciprofloxacin (from D61 to D95: 1.2 g continuously over 24 hours for 4 days, followed by 2.4 g over 24 hours for a further 31 days) and i.v. cefepim (from D61 to D95: 4 × 2 g/day for 4 days to 4 × 3 g/day for a further 31 days; see below for the inhibitory minimal concentration and the plasma and CSF concentrations of antibiotics) and amikacine and polymyxin B colistine both administered directly into the ventricles.
The third episode of meningitis appeared at D66 with identification of the same Ps. aeruginosa O12 in CSF culture, increased CSF protein and decreased CSF glucose levels in both ELD and EVD. Antibiotics were kept constant and, despite negative cultures, ELD and EVD were replaced with new drains. Interestingly, since this last episode of meningitis, the pharyngeal fistula disappeared, which indicated the end of pharyngeal contamination of CSF. The patient improved rapidly and was discharged home at D108. No further episode of meningitis during the next 3 years, nor any toxic effect related to the high doses of antibiotics, was observed. It is noteworthy that repetitive cerebral computed tomography scans showed no empyema.
Figure shows the time course of the following parameters: leukocyte counts, glucose and protein concentrations, measured in parallel in CSF from EVD and ELD, for 17 days (D57 to D73) corresponding to the second and third episodes of meningitis. Figure shows strikingly that the leukocytes and the protein concentration were always higher and the glucose concentration was always lower in ELD than in EVD. Interestingly, the highest ventriculo-lumbar CSF gradients in leukocytes, protein and glucose concentration were present at the very acute phase of meningitis, when Ps. aeruginosa O12 was present in the meningeal cavity.
Our case also showed that the increase in the amount of antibiotics given did increase their concentration in plasma but not in CSF. Indeed, i.v. cefepim was increased from 8 to 12 g/day and i.v. ciprofloxacin from 1.2 to 2.4 g/day from D64 to D95. This induced a persistent increase in plasma cefepim concentration from 46 μ g/ml to more than 60 μg/ml and plasma ciprofloxacin concentration from 0.2 μg/ml to more than 1.0 μg/ml. However, only a transient increase in cefepim concentration (D63, 7 μg/ml; D73, 15 μg/ml; D81 and D95, less than 9 μg/ml) and no increase in ciprofloxacin concentration (0.4–0.5 μg/ml from D63 to 95) were seen in lumbar and ventricular CSF. It is noteworthy that the inhibitory minimal concentrations of cefepim and ciprofloxacin for Ps. aeruginosa O12 were 16 and 0.25 mg/ml, respectively.","[[20.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['sphenoidal sinus to the anterior face of C2', 'pharyngeal wall', 'skin', 'arm', 'wall', 'pharyngeal cavity', 'ventricular', 'ventricular drain', 'oral cavity', 'CSF', 'ventricular', 'controlateral hemisphere', 'fistula', 'ventricles', 'occipito-cervical', 'lumbar', 'pharyngeal', '4th ventricle', 'ventricles', 'D66', 'pharyngeal', 'pharyngeal', 'cerebral', 'ventriculo-lumbar', 'meningeal cavity', 'lumbar and ventricular CSF']","['chordoma', 'tumour', 'hydrocephalia', 'tumour', 'occlusive', 'CSF leak', 'meningitis', 'fever', 'CSF withdrawn through the ventricular drain', 'A Ps. aeruginosa O12', 'CSF leakage', 'meningitis', 'hydrocephalia', 'meningitis', 'fever', 'bacteria', 'meningitis', 'pharyngeal fistula', 'obstruction', 'oedema', 'Meningitis', 'meningitis', 'Ps. aeruginosa', 'ELD', 'EVD', 'ELD', 'EVD', 'meningitis', 'pharyngeal fistula', 'pharyngeal contamination of CSF', 'improved rapidly', 'meningitis', 'toxic effect', 'empyema', 'EVD', 'ELD', 'meningitis', 'ELD', 'EVD', 'meningitis', 'Ps. aeruginosa O12', 'increase in ciprofloxacin concentration', 'Ps. aeruginosa O12']","['ceftazidime', 'polymyxin B', 'ceftazidime', 'amikacin', 'polymyxin B', 'ciprofloxacin', 'D61', 'cefepim', 'amikacine', 'polymyxin B colistine', 'cefepim', 'ciprofloxacin', 'D64', 'D95', 'ciprofloxacin', 'D63', 'cefepim', 'ciprofloxacin']",['20'],"['elective surgery of a chordoma that extended from the sphenoidal sinus to the anterior face of C2', 'subtotal removal of the tumour by a transfrontal approach', 'EVD was inserted', 'transoral resection of the tumour', 'reconstruction of the pharyngeal wall with skin taken from the arm', 'white blood cell count', 'CSF withdrawn through the ventricular drain', 'CSF leukocytes', 'CSF protein concentration', 'CSF glucose concentration', 'glycaemia', 'antibiotics', 'CSF culture', 'replace the ventricular drain with another in the controlateral hemisphere', 'withdraw CSF', 'biochemical', 'bacteriological analysis', 'Antibiotherapy', 'occipito-cervical fixation procedure', 'EVD removed', 'ELD', 'EVD', 'lumbar CSF leukocytes', 'CSF protein concentration', 'glucose concentration', 'glycaemia', 'CSF culture', 'ELD was replaced with a new one', 'EVD', 'antibiotics', 'CSF culture', 'CSF protein', 'CSF glucose levels', 'Antibiotics', 'cultures', 'ELD and EVD were replaced with new drains', 'replaced with new drains', 'antibiotics', 'cerebral computed tomography scans', 'leukocyte counts', 'glucose', 'protein', 'protein concentrations', 'leukocytes', 'protein concentration', 'glucose concentration', 'ventriculo-lumbar CSF gradients in leukocytes, protein and glucose concentration', 'antibiotics', 'plasma cefepim concentration', 'cefepim concentration', 'ciprofloxacin concentration']","['day 1 (D1)', 'Seven days later', 'Seven days later', 'Three days later', 'Twelve days later', 'post-surgical', 'next 3 years']"

A chest x-ray showed a large mass projecting over the right lung field (fig ). A CT scan of the chest showed an enormous anterior mediastinal mass contiguous with the posterior aspect of the sternum and the right ribs, occluding the superior vena cava and compressing the heart (fig ). Blood tests were normal, tumor markers and Acetyl Choline Receptor Antibodies were negative. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and the biopsy showed the features of a carcinoid tumor.
He underwent excision of the tumor, which required resection of the superior vena cava and insertion of a graft, resection of the right phrenic nerve and plication of the diaphragm.
The finding at surgery was an enormous spherical tumor with an extremely vascular capsule due to the venous collaterals. The tumor was 20 cm from pole to pole and 15 cm in diameter. On the left it bulged into the left pleural space, displacing the phrenic nerve laterally. Superiorly it obliterated the left innominate vein and extend into the strap muscles. There was an enlarged lymph node. On the right it had obliterated the confluence of the innominate veins and the first centimeter or so of the superior vena cava. It enclosed the phrenic nerve over its complete length and was adherent to the medial aspects of the upper and middle lobes of the right lung. There was some thickening of the visceral pleura in this area and there appeared to be some superficial infiltration. Posteriorly it was adherent to the pericardium and there was some thickening of the ascending aorta, consistent with longstanding pressure effects. There was a small bloody pericardial effusion and a rather large right pleural effusion. There was no evidence of any pleural deposits or intrapericardial deposits.
The histology of the resection specimen showed a tumor weighing 2.1 kg. The tumor appeared encapsulated with an irregular surface. The tumor invaded the surrounding fat and pleura. There was infiltration into the underlying lung tissue lymphatics. There was some residual thymic tissue within the surrounding fat. Metastatic deposits were found in the right hilar lymph node and the node removed from the left cervical horn of the thymus. The tumor was classified as an atypical carcinoid of the thymus (neuroendocrine carcinoma of intermediate grade 2).
One month later he underwent a CT scan of the chest. There were findings consistent with a recent sternotomy and a graft of the superior vena cava. There was a fluid filled cyst at the base of the right lung and areas of atelectasis and pleural thickening were noted in both lungs.
An I-123 MIBG scan was performed with negative results for detection of any residual or recurrent pathology.
He was treated with postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
One year later, a follow-up CT scan of the chest was obtained with no findings of recurrence or abnormal lymph nodes in the mediastinum. Linear atelectasis was detected in the lower lobes of both lungs and elevation of the right hemi diaphragm was noted. In addition a bone scan was performed with a positive finding at the posterior arch of the 8th right rib. The patient was advised to have a SRS, for a more accurate evaluation of his status, as it was considered that ""functional"" imaging performed by Nuclear Medicine examinations, might detect pathological processes earlier than ""structural"" images, such as CT.
Spot images of head-neck, thorax, abdomen and lumbar region were obtained 3 hr after injection of 5 mCi In-111-DTPA-D-Phe 1-pentetreotide. The scan was carried out on a Sopha single headed tomographic gamma camera coupled to a dedicated NXT computer system. Spot images of the areas of interest were obtained with a high-energy all-purpose collimator using 20% windows centered at 171 and 245 keV.

Her obstetric history included two first trimester abortions. The patient had taken no medication or drug for ovulation induction. An inquiry into the family history revealed that her mother had delivered triplet babies all of whom died in the early neonatal period. In the present case, the attending obstetrician had performed an ultrasonography at 6 weeks of gestation demonstrating a single, 17 × 20 mm gestational sac (chorion) (Figure ).
Detailed ultrasonography at our maternal and fetal unit revealed a monochorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancy. Three thin amniotic membranes and an ipsilon zone were detected. The biometric measurements of the three distinct fetuses were appropriate for 15 weeks of gestation. The parents were informed about the risks of a multiple pregnancy and monochorionic placentation. After three days' hospitalization, the vaginal bleeding ceased and the patient was discharged to follow-up.
The obstetric course was unremarkable until 24 weeks, when ultrasonographic examination revealed that one of the triplet fetuses had developed a multicystic lung lesion suggestive of CCAM, with the largest cyst measuring 10 mm in diameter (Figure ). Until 30 weeks of gestation, the fetuses had appropriate growth, and follow-up of the pregnancy was uneventful except that the fetus with CCAM developed mild polyhydramnios. At 30 weeks, the patient presented with preterm uterine contractions that ceased after tocolysis with nifedipine 60 mg per day. Betamethasone (12 mg × 2 doses in 24 hours) was administered intramuscularly to the mother to promote fetal lung maturation. The patient was readmitted to our unit at 34 weeks for uterine contractions and impaired fetal growth. The size of the lung lesion remained the same at that time. At 35 weeks of gestation, the patient underwent a low-transverse caesarean section and delivered three live male babies with birth weights 1560 g, 1580 g and 1590 g. Apgar scores were 7/9, 6/8 and 7/9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. A single placenta weighing 1080 g and three distinct membranes were demonstrated (Figure ). Pathological examination confirmed monochorionic triamniotic placentation. The postnatal course was uneventful and the patient was discharged four days postpartum. Two newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress, the third one died due to sepsis on day 7 postpartum. One of the triplets was discharged healthy 42 days postpartum.
The newborn with multicystic lung lesions developed unilateral pneumothorax which was treated by inserting an intercostal drain, and was discharged from the hospital after one month. Computerized tomography (CT) of the infant at 3 months demonstrated two cystic lesions in the middle lobe of the right lung (25 mm and 15 mm in diameter) (Figure ).

Continuous hemodiafiltration was started. Cultures of blood, urine, stools and tracheal aspiration were negative. Toxicological screening tests, including acetaminophen, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and methanol were negative. HIV-1 ELISA serology was positive, CD4+ lymphocytes count 160 × 106 /l (N >700), and HIV-1 RNA level was 5.8 × 105 copies/ml. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed 2.5 × 108 cells/l with 58% lymphocytes. A diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was rapidly assessed by an amplification assay (Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test, Gen Probe, California) and retrospectively confirmed by BAL cultures. Isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide were started on day 3. Endoscopic examination showed grade II esophageal varices, moderate peptic esophagitis, erythematous gastritis with cardial superficial ulcerations without active bleeding, and normal duodenum and colon. CMV culture using MRC5 cells inoculation was positive in blood but not in BAL. CMV amplification assay was negative in the cerebrospinal fluid. Histopathologic analysis of a gastric biopsy showed edema, inflammatory infiltrate and typical intranuclear cytomegalic inclusion bodies in endothelial cells in mucosa. Immunohistochemistry with a specific anti-CMV antibody (E13, Argène, France) confirmed active CMV infection of the stomach (Fig. ). Specific staining and culture were negative for Helicobacter pylori. As soon as these results were known (on day 10), ganciclovir was started. Concomitant abdominal CT scan disclosed large and heterogeneous peripancreatic hypodensities, mildly enhanced following contrast infusion (Fig. ). However, their exact etiology remained undetermined. The patient developed hospital-acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia and his condition worsened. He died 30 days after admission. Postmortem examination showed a large, well-circumscribed gastric perforation with a diameter of 4 cm. The stomach was solidly adhered to the transverse colon and to the lower face of the liver. There was a thick necrotic and hemorrhagic inflammatory coating around the pancreas, which, in contrast, appeared macroscopically normal. The whole GI tract, except the stomach, was normal.
CMV infection of the GI tract can cause severe damage. Isolated involvement of the stomach is possible, although rare [,]. Symptoms are not specific, including unexplained fever, dysphagia, sharp or postural epigastric pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and GI bleeding. Characteristic upper endoscopic findings are edema, congestion, mucosal ulcerations, multiple punched-out gastric ulcers, erosions, and upper GI hemorrhage []. However, findings may be mild showing congestion and thickening or be atypical, with hemorrhaged necrotic gastritis or pseudo-tumors []. Multiple mucosal biopsies are needed to detect CMV []. In HIV-infected patients, CMV is significantly associated with chronic active gastritis or gastroduodenal ulcers [-], in contrast with healthy adults, in whom symptomatic CMV gastric infection is exceptional []. Thus, early recognition of CMV GI infection, including blood cultures and cautious GI endoscopic evaluation, may allow for adequate therapy, preventing complications, such as life-threatening bleeding or perforation [,].
CMV infection activates endothelial cells and leukocytes, altering GI microcirculation and inducing extensive vasculitis, thrombotic vascular occlusion, necrosis, and ischemic perforation []. The most common reported locations of intestinal perforation are the colon (53%) [-], the distal ileum (40%) [,], and the appendix (7%) []. CMV-associated perforation of the stomach is a rare presentation []. To our knowledge, isolated CMV-induced gastric perforation has only been reported in non-HIV organ transplant recipients []. In our patient, CMV-associated gastric perforation, as a presenting manifestation of HIV infection, was responsible for multiorgan failure. The diagnosis was difficult, in the absence of acute abdomen and pneumoperitonium. Consistently, initial endoscopic examination missed the gastric perforation, since the hole in the stomach was probably filled in by peritoneum. Moreover it is possible that a suboptimal endoscopic evaluation of the upper GI tract was due to the patient's initial unstable condition and the performance of the gastroscopy in such a critical situation. In contrast, concomitant abdominal CT scan showed large hypodense images surrounding the pancreas, attributed after postmortem examination, to the hemorrhagic and necrotic inflammatory materials that filled in the gastric perforation.
Alternative causes of gastric ulcer, including Helicobacter pylori infection, should be discussed. Indeed, CMV is an opportunistic virus and may thus appear in previously damaged tissues. However, a recent study suggested that CMV, rather than Helicobacter pylori, may be the main causative pathogen of peptic ulcers in HIV-infected patients, in comparison to non HIV-infected ones []. In our case, histopathologic findings and cultures were negative for Helicobacter pylori. Moreover, CMV inclusion bodies, which were observed on initial pathological findings, clearly indicated the existence of a CMV disease at the patient's admission.
Usually, resolution of symptoms and endoscopic findings is obtained with IV ganciclovir or foscarnet. Combined antiretroviral therapies may also be effective, even without specific treatment of CMV []. However, in the case of perforation, despite immediate surgical resection and antiviral therapy, mortality rate remains elevated (> 80%), due to elevated operative mortality and increased postoperative complications [,]. In our case, ganciclovir therapy successfully reduced CMV viral load before the occurrence of death, which resulted from misdiagnosed gastric perforation.","[[47.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['abdominal',

Two weeks prior to his arrival, he had developed abdominal pain, a recurring fever of up to 39°C, and an intermittent cough. These symptoms were worsening and his general condition was deteriorating.
On examination he had diffuse abdominal pain located primarily in the upper abdomen, and his temperature was 38.5°C. His skin and the further physical examination was normal. Pertinent laboratory investigations are listed in Table . Of note, the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time were both prolonged, mild thrombopenia and leukocytosis of 14/nl were present, and C-reactive protein was elevated (6.1 mg/dl). The activity of factors II, V, VII and VIII was normal. There was no history of autoimmune diseases or coagulation disorders in his family.
The initial abdominal ultrasound revealed a tumor in the right pararenal space. However, a clear anatomical relation to the adrenal gland could not be established (Figures 1 and 2- see Additional file and ). The left adrenal gland was slightly enlarged. Doppler ultrasonography showed no thromboses of abdominal vessels and serum cortisol was normal at this stage. The CT scan identified the tumor as hematoma.
Additional tests were positive for lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Bleeding time was prolonged to 11 minutes but all other coagulation tests eliminated the possibility of acute bleeding. In fact a repeated test of bleeding time a few days later was normal.
Under intravenous treatment with cefuroxim the patient's temperature normalized within two days. But by day five, C-reactive protein increased to 12 mg/dl, and the patient's temperature rose again so antibiotic therapy was extended by gentamycin.
Ten day after being admitted, the boy suddenly suffered generalized tonic-clonic seizures due to severe hyponatremia of 111 mmol/l. Serum transaminases raised to levels five times above normal range, and after three days hemoglobin dropped from 11.8 g/l to 7.6 g/l. Since LDH was elevated and haptoglobin was reduced, we diagnosed hemolytic anemia and transfused him with erythrocyte concentrates.
Two days before the acute onset of adrenal insufficiency, microhematuria began. Proteinuria increased to 1 g/l and β-2-microglobulin raised to 0.16 mg/dl but there were no clinical signs of urinary infection. As the C-reactive protein rose to 16.1 mg/dl, intravenous antibiotic treatment was changed to erythromycin, ceftriaxon, tobramycin and flucloxacillin. However, two blood cultures, urine culture, stool culture and liquor culture remained sterile. Furthermore, serum serological tests were negative for the following infections: borrelia-burgdorferi, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, listeria, leptospira, epstein-barr-virus, treponema pallidum, parvovirus B 19, cytomegalie virus, mycoplasma pneumonia, coxsackivirus type B1-B6, chlamydia pneumonia and toxoplasmosis. Tuberculosis was ruled out by mendel-mantoux skin test, microscopy of Ziehl-Nelson stained urine samples, PCR of a urine and liquor sample, and chest x-ray.
The boy was transferred to the intensive care unit and hyponatremia was balanced within the next 12 h with intravenous application of NaCl 5.85%. Over the course of the next 5 h until his serum sodium was above 125 mmol/l, he had repeated convulsions for up to 30 minutes. Due to status epilepticus and marked agitation, intubation and artificial ventilation was required.
A second CT scan on the next day showed a novel hemorrhage of the left adrenal as well and bleeding in the right pararenal region had enlarged (Figure 3- see ). A CT scan of the head was normal, cortisol was low and the adrenals were unresponsive to the Synacten test. We started treatment with hydrocortisone, fludrocortisone and 10 days later with phenprocoumon.
Under this treatment the boy improved clinically within two days and was extubated. As well, laboratory signs of hepatitis normalized within the next three weeks and hemoglobin remained in normal range after blood transfusion. The C-reactive protein normalized within 10 days and antibiotic treatment was stopped as no other clinical or laboratory signs of infection were present.
We continued to monitor the patients condition. As shown in table , lupus anticoagulant and cardiolipin antibodies remained positive. He did not develop any other autoimmune diseases (Table ). The boy's parents and his brother were negative for lupus anticoagulant and cardiolipin antibodies.","[[14.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['abdominal', 'abdominal', 'upper abdomen', 'skin', 'abdominal', 'right pararenal space', 'adrenal gland', 'left adrenal gland', 'adrenal gland', 'abdominal vessels', 'adrenal', 'urinary', 'skin', 'chest', 'left adrenal', 'right pararenal region', 'head', 'adrenals']","['abdominal pain', 'fever', 'cough', 'symptoms', 'general condition was deteriorating', 'abdominal pain', 'thrombopenia', 'autoimmune diseases', 'coagulation disorders', 'tumor', 'enlarged', 'thromboses of abdominal vessels', 'tumor', 'hematoma', 'lupus', 'bleeding', 'bleeding', 'generalized tonic-clonic seizures', 'hyponatremia', 'hemolytic anemia', 'adrenal insufficiency', 'microhematuria', 'Proteinuria', 'urinary infection', 'infections', 'borrelia-burgdorferi', 'HIV', 'hepatitis B virus', 'hepatitis C virus', 'listeria', 'leptospira', 'epstein-barr-virus', 'treponema pallidum', 'parvovirus B 19', 'cytomegalie virus', 'mycoplasma pneumonia', 'coxsackivirus type B1-B6', 'chlamydia pneumonia', 'toxoplasmosis', 'Tuberculosis', 'hyponatremia', 'convulsions', 'status epilepticus', 'agitation', 'hemorrhage of the left adrenal', 'bleeding', 'adrenals were unresponsive', 'unresponsive to the Synacten test', 'improved clinically', 'hepatitis normalized', 'infection', 'autoimmune diseases', 'lupus anticoagulant', 'cardiolipin antibodies']","['cefuroxim', 'gentamycin', 'erythromycin', 'ceftriaxon', 'tobramycin', 'flucloxacillin', 'NaCl', 'hydrocortisone', 'fludrocortisone', 'phenprocoumon']","['September 2001', '14', 'mendel', 'intensive care unit']","['temperature', 'physical examination', 'laboratory', 'activated partial thromboplastin time', 'prothrombin time', 'leukocytosis', 'C-reactive protein', 'activity of factors II, V, VII and VIII', 'abdominal ultrasound', 'Doppler ultrasonography', 'serum cortisol', 'CT scan', 'tests', 'lupus anticoagulant', 'anti-cardiolipin antibodies', 'Bleeding time', 'coagulation tests', 'bleeding time', 'treatment', 'temperature', 'C-reactive protein', 'temperature', 'antibiotic therapy', 'Serum transaminases', 'hemoglobin', 'LDH', 'haptoglobin', 'transfused', 'erythrocyte concentrates', 'Proteinuria', '-2-microglobulin', 'microglobulin', 'C-reactive protein', 'antibiotic treatment', 'blood cultures', 'urine culture', 'stool culture', 'liquor culture', 'serum serological tests', 'mendel-mantoux skin test', 'microscopy of Ziehl-Nelson stained urine samples', 'Nelson stained urine samples', 'PCR of a urine and liquor sample', 'chest x-ray', 'serum sodium', 'intubation', 'artificial ventilation', 'CT scan', 'CT scan of the head', 'cortisol', 'Synacten test', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'extubated', 'laboratory signs of hepatitis', 'hemoglobin', 'blood transfusion', 'C-reactive protein', 'antibiotic treatment', 'lupus anticoagulant', 'cardiolipin antibodies']","['Two weeks', 'prior to his arrival', 'few days later', 'few days later', 'two days', 'after three days', 'Two days', 'up to 30 minutes', 'next day', 'two days', 'next three weeks', 'next three weeks', 'within 10 days']"

The patient had undergone chemotherapy with treosulfane via a totally implantable venous access port catheter the day before.
The venous silicone catheter system (Fresenius Intraport, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) had been implanted 2 years before via the left cephalic vein by tangential incision of the vein after distal ligation without intra- or postoperative complications in our department. Correct placement had been documented by x-ray of the chest immediately after the implantation (figure ). Following implantation, the catheter had been used for three months without any problems. Thereafter, the system was regularly flushed with heparin-saline solution. On presentation, injection into the port catheter was freely possible but caused instant reflectory coughing. Aspiration of blood via the port was not possible. Laboratory findings showed a mild leukocytosis of 11.0/nl and hypokalemia of 2.6 mmol/l.
Further radiological diagnostics including injection of contrast medium into the catheter documented a dislocation of the catheter tip into the upper lobe of the right lung with paravasation into the bronchial system (figure ). In addition, thoracic computerised tomographic (CT) scan showed a large pleural effusion in the right pleural cavity (figure ). There was no evidence for mediastinal or intrapulmonal tumour growth or lymph node metastases at the site of perforation. The patient was referred to the department of thoracic surgery for further therapy. The intrapulmonal tip of the port catheter was cut off and extracted thoracoscopically. The remaining catheter retracted into the superior caval vein lumen. As the patient had undergone mammarial gland ablation on both sides with consecutive radiation there was a severe dermatitis with ulcerations at the implantation site of the port catheter. Due to the high-risk of infection and wound healing complications and the limited life-expectancy of the patient, it was decided to leave the injection chamber and catheter remnant in situ without any further use for injections or infusions.

At presentation she had dyspnea at rest, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Around two and a half months before the present illness, she had low grade fever, anorexia and weight loss, cough with expectoration and hemoptysis. She was investigated at another center and a sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli was positive. She was started on antituberculous therapy with which she improved symptomatically. She experienced weight gain, and her appetite became normal. A sputum smear performed after two months for acid-fast bacilli was negative. On examination, the patient was conscious and afebrile with a pulse rate of 128 beats/minute, blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg and a respiratory rate of 38/minute. She had bilateral pitting pedal edema. Examination of the cardiovascular system revealed tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, diffuse apical impulse and left ventricular third heart sound. Auscultation of the chest showed bibasal inspiratory crackles. She also had tender hepatomegaly and free fluid in the abdomen. Her oxygen saturation was 85% on pulse oximetry. Arterial blood gases showed type 1 respiratory failure [(FiO2 0.5) – pH 7.48, PaO2 8.2 kPa, PaCO2 3.6 kPa, HCO3 21 mEq/L]. She was started on supplemental oxygen, intravenous morphine, nitroglycerin, furosemide and dobutamine, oral captopril, stress ulcer and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Chest X-ray (Figure ) done two months ago showed right upper lobe consolidation with normal cardiac silhouette. A chest radiograph (Figure ) performed at admission revealed cardiomegaly and bilateral alveolar opacities. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia and non-specific ST-T changes in the lateral leads. Echocardiography was performed which revealed global hypokinesia, enlarged left atrium and left ventricle, mild mitral regurgitation, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20%; left ventricular end systolic and end diastolic dimensions were 45 and 51 mm respectively. Right atrium and right ventricle were dilated with associated mild tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 47 mm Hg. A provisional diagnosis of viral myocarditis was made and she was shifted to respiratory intensive care unit where noninvasive ventilation (NIV) was initiated with continuous positive airway pressure at 10 cm H2O. Arterial line was placed through the right radial artery and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring was performed. As the patient had no improvement with NIV and was becoming hypoxemic and agitated, she was given intravenous fentanyl and oral endotracheal intubation was performed. She was mechanically ventilated with assist/control mode at tidal volumes of 350 mL, rate of 20, PEEP of 10 cm H2O, and FiO2 of 1. Her peak and plateau pressures were 35 and 28 cm H2O respectively. She was sedated intermittently with intravenous fentanyl. Blood cultures, mycoplasma and legionella serology were sent and patient was also started on intravenous azithromycin. Other treatment measures and antituberculous therapy were continued. Biochemical investigations revealed hypoalbuminemia and prerenal azotemia; liver function tests, complete blood, coagulation profile and urinalysis were normal. With mechanical ventilation, oxygen saturation improved and oxygen requirements decreased to 0.4. She had recurrent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and amiodarone infusion was started. However on the second day of admission she had a sudden episode of ventricular fibrillation and despite all resuscitative measures the patient could not be revived. Her husband did not give consent for an autopsy; however he agreed for a post-mortem cardiac biopsy, which revealed multi-focal areas of caseous myocardial necrosis, Ziehl-Neelson stain for acid-fast bacilli was positive (Figure ).

Ultrasound scanning suggested acute cholecystitis. The patient was explored initially by laparoscopy but converted to an open operation at the referring hospital. An irresectable mass, which was thought to be an advanced gallbladder carcinoma, was found. Several needle biopsies were taken from the tumour but the gallbladder was not excised. Histology of the biopsies showed features of IMT of the gallbladder. She developed obstructive jaundice postoperatively, ERCP showed a distal bile duct stricture which was stented. CT scan showed a mass lesion in the gallbladder area with direct involvement of the liver and no metastatic disease elsewhere (Figure ). In view of the histological diagnosis the patient underwent re-laparotomy through an extended subcostal incision. Operative findings included a tense, distended gallbladder containing stones, debris and pus with a segment of transverse colon densely adherent to the mass. An en-bloc cholecystectomy and limited transverse colectomy with primary anastomosis was performed. The mass was peeled off the first and second part of duodenum, common bile duct and transverse mesocolon. Intra-operative cholangiogram via the cystic duct stump showed no biliary leakage and the dye flowed freely into the duodenum with the biliary stent in situ.
On pathological examination, the tumour measured 12 cms. Microscopy of the resected mass showed the gallbladder wall to be replaced by proliferative spindle myofibroblastic cells arranged in fascicles, admixed with diffuse chronic inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils with lymphoid aggregates. In places hyalinised fibrous stroma was seen. No pleomorphism or vascular invasion was evident. Mitoses were inconspicuous (Figure ). The mass was seen to grow in an infiltrating pattern with entrapment of adipocytes and extending to the muscularis propria of colon from externally. The tumour extended to the resection margin.

She denied symptoms of cough or phlegm. She was diagnosed with musculoskeletal pain and discharged home on analgesics. Five days later she presented with ongoing symptoms of fever, chills with dry cough and right lower chest pain. A chest X-ray revealed an infiltrate in the right lower lobe. She was diagnosed with community acquired right lower lobe pneumonia and sent home on oral clarithromycin. She presented 4-days later with ongoing symptoms to the emergency department and the chest x-ray now showed worsening pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous ampicillin and ceftriaxone, and a ventilation-perfusion scan showed a matched perfusion defect in right lower lobe. She continued to feel weak with night sweats and chest X-ray showed worsening of infiltrate. A medical consult was requested. At this time, during consultation it was noted that her symptoms started after a short stay at the cottage that reminded me of the previous case, and the possibility of acute blastomycosis pneumonia was raised. Her white blood cell count remained slightly elevated at 13.0 but erythrocyte sedimentation rate was markedly elevated at 112. As she didn't have productive cough, a bronchoscopy was recommended that couldn't be performed locally [local bronchoscopist was away] and she was referred to a tertiary care center where bronchio-aleveolar lavage showed budding yeast and cultures confirmed growth of blastomycosis.

Physical examination was unremarkable. She was afebrile and lungs were clear. Homen's sign was negative. Initial laboratory data showed slightly elevated d-dimer of 0.374 ug/mL [normal <0.25 ug/mL]. A chest X-ray (figure ) showed right lower lobe infiltrate. She was diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia and sent home on oral clarithromycin 500 mg BID, cefurox 500 mg BID for 7 days and acetaminophen as required.
She continued to have symptoms of fever, chills, night sweats with productive cough and dyspnea and presented to the hospital five days later. She denied hemoptysis. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 39 degree Celsius, mild tachycardia with heart rate of 104 beats per minute, normal blood pressure of 125/74 mmHg and respiratory rate of 18. Pulse oxymetry revealed oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. There was decreased air entry with bronchial breath sounds in right lower chest. A white cell count was slightly elevated at 13.5, with normal hemoglobin of 128 g/L and d-dimer between 0.25–0.50 ug/mL. A second chest X-ray (figure ) showed dense infiltrate in right lower lobe. She was admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia and started on intravenous levofloxacin 500 mg a day.
She had a positive Mantoux test in 1976. There was no history of travel save for visiting her sister's cottage at the local lake a weak before where she slept at the gazebo for two nights. There were no pets at home. She smoked one pack per day and entertained social drinks.
She continued to have temperature up to 39 degrees Celsius, productive cough and shortness of breath. Sputum Gram stain showed 4+ neutrophils and 1+ normal flora and blood cultures remained negative. She received intravenous levofloxacin and clindamycin for one week. Bronchoscopy performed on day 6 was unremarkable save for inflammatory changes in lower lungs and samples were collected for bacterial and tuberculosis cultures [in retrospect, the specimen was not sent for fungal cultures]. On 7th day because of ongoing symptoms, the antibiotics were changed to intravenous imipenem-cilastatin sodium 1 gm every 12 hour and she has had a CT scan of chest (figure ) that showed bibasilar consolidation with sparing of the apices. The white cell count fluctuated between 13.6 to 20.2 [normal 4.0–11.0 × 109 /L]. Hemoglobin decreased to 97 g/L. BUN, serum creatinine, electrolytes, AST, ALT, GGT and ALP were normal. Urinalysis was negative. Blood, urine and sputum cultures remained negative. Sputum gram stain showed 3-4+ neutrophils without organisms. ESR on day 8 was elevated at 112 mm/hr [normal 0–15]. Antinuclear antibody was negative. Arterial blood gas on day 8 showed pH of 7.46, pCO2 of 35, pO2 of 59 and oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. She was started on supplemental oxygen by nasal prongs. Bronchoscopic specimen cultures were negative save for pending TB cultures.
After five days of intravenous imipenem-cilastatin sodium therapy, there was no improvement in her clinical condition. Another medical consult was requested, when the author got involved in her care. She had a temperature of 39 C, pulse rate of 104 and blood pressure of 114/70 mmHg. There was no lymphadenopathy and heart sounds were normal. Her chest examination showed decreased breath sounds at both bases with egophony in right lower chest. There were no pleural rubs. There was no clubbing or cyanosis. The rest of the examination was unremarkable save for an obese benign abdomen.
Chest X-ray (figure ) now showed further deterioration of the bilateral infiltrates with nodular appearance and the radiologist remarked, ""The lesions are suspicious of metastases."" Sputum cytology showed a large number of acute inflammatory cells without malignant cells. The possibility of vasculitis was entertained because of markedly elevated ESR and antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) was negative.
The history of sleeping at the cottage for two nights, a week before her illness started; progressive bilateral pneumonia with ongoing high-grade fever, chills, and night sweats despite sufficient antibiotic coverage and sputum Gram stain showing a large number of neutrophils without organisms (culture negative) raised the author's suspicion for the possibility of fungal process such as acute blastomycosis pneumonia and the Public Health Laboratory (PHL) was specifically asked to perform wet preparation for blastomycosis on the sputum. The PHL laboratory confirmed the presence of 'round thick walled budding yeast like cells (figure ) suggestive of Blastomyces dermatitidis and this was confirmed on fungal cultures. She was promptly started on intravenous amphotericin B and responded well and later switched to oral itraconazole 400 mg twice a day for 6 months and then 200 mg a day for another 6 months.

Physical examination was normal, including BMI. Liver function tests were as follows: ASAT = 53 IU/L (Normal = 40); ALAT = 58 IU/L (N = 50); Billirubin = 44 μmol/L (N = 17); PT = 70% (N = 70–100); V = 65% (N = 70–100); RBC = 2.9 × 106 cells/μl; Ht = 22.5% and Hb = 7.3 gm/dl; WBC = 4.6 × 103 cells/μl; and platelets = 210 × 109 /l. Ferritinemia was 1891 ng/l (N < 300), transferrin saturation was 100% (N < 40), iron concentration was 290 μmol/g (assessed by MRI, N < 36). AFP in blood was within the normal range. The patient, of Italian origin, was C282 Y -/-, H63D +/-, and S65C -/-, with no family history of iron overload. Markers for viral and autoimmune diseases were negative. Blood glucose was normal. He used to smoke 30 cigarettes per day; but had stopped for the last 8 years. He drank alcohol only occasionally. The treatment of his refractory anaemia consisted in blood transfusion (total of 10 packs), Desferoxamine, and Deferiprone.
Ultrasound examination showed a hypoechogenic ovoid nodule (3.2 × 1.9 cm) in segment II. MRI showed a hypointense non-tumoral liver on T1- and T2-weighted images due to iron overload. In comparison, the nodule was hyperintense on T1- and T2-weighted images. After gadolinium injection, the nodule was hyperintense on T1-weigthed images and remained so in the portal phase (Fig. ).
On December 2003, a left lobe hepatectomy was performed laparoscopically. Follow-up was uneventful. The resected specimen was carefully sliced but no nodule was found on the fresh specimen, and in the expected area. However, after formalin fixation, a 2 cm in diameter paler area was identified (Fig. , arrow). All slices were routinely processed. The following stainings were performed: H&E, trichrome, Perls, reticulin, PAS, and several immunostains (CD34, cytokeratins 7 and 19, CRBP1 and α-SMA; the latter for identification of quiescent and/or activated hepatic stellate cells []). The liver was fibrotic (METAVIR score F3) (Figs. , ) with an iron overload 3 + (according to Searle score), mainly in hepatocytes of zones 1 and 2 (Fig. ). Liver iron concentration was 286 μmol/g (n < 36), and the iron concentration / age ratio was 5.1. Small foci of clear cells devoid of iron were also observed (not shown).
The paler zone, poorly limited from the adjacent parenchyma, was strikingly different. The architecture was preserved but the area was far less fibrotic (METAVIR score F1; Figs. , ), with less iron (Fig. ), less glycogen (Fig. ), and with foci of clear hepatocytes (Figs. , ). In these clear areas, hepatocytes were slightly bigger and occasionally displayed in two cell-thick plates. In these areas, as elsewhere, reticulin network, as well as Ki-67 (Mib-1) and CD34 were normal (not shown). One of the most striking findings was the presence of different types of portal tracts: some were normal (Fig. ), whereas others contained mainly ductules (Fig. ) and others arteries (Fig. ). Regarding the number of CRBP1 and α-SMA positive cells, no obvious differences were seen between the fibrotic and non-fibrotic parts of the liver. CRBP 1 positive cells seemed to contain few lipid droplets.","[[55.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['liver', 'segment II', 'Liver', 'segment II.', 'liver', 'left lobe', 'fresh specimen', 'hepatic', 'hepatic stellate cells', 'liver', 'Liver', 'adjacent parenchyma', 'two cell-thick plates', 'reticulin network', 'portal tracts', 'ductules', 'arteries', 'fibrotic and non-fibrotic parts of the liver']","['idiopathic refractory anaemia', 'hypervascular liver nodule', 'iron overload', 'viral and autoimmune diseases', 'autoimmune diseases', 'smoke', 'drank alcohol', 'refractory anaemia', 'hypoechogenic ovoid nodule', 'hypointense non-tumoral liver', 'iron overload', 'nodule', 'nodule was hyperintense', 'nodule', 'nodule', 'paler area', 'quiescent and/or activated hepatic stellate cells', 'liver was fibrotic', 'hepatocytes of zones 1 and 2', 'foci of clear cells devoid of iron', 'paler zone', 'architecture was preserved', 'fibrotic', 'iron', 'glycogen', 'foci of clear hepatocytes', 'clear areas', 'hepatocytes', 'Ki-67 (Mib-1) and CD34 were normal', 'obvious differences', 'lipid droplets']","['Desferoxamine', 'Deferiprone', 'gadolinium']","['55', 'November, 2003', 'December 2003']","['Physical examination', 'BMI', 'Liver function tests', 'ASAT', 'ALAT', 'Billirubin', 'PT', 'V', 'RBC', 'Ht', 'Hb', 'WBC', 'platelets', 'Ferritinemia', 'transferrin saturation', 'iron concentration', 'MRI', 'AFP in blood', 'Markers for viral and autoimmune diseases', 'Blood glucose', 'treatment', 'blood transfusion', 'Ultrasound examination', 'MRI', 'left lobe hepatectomy was performed laparoscopically', 'resected specimen was carefully sliced', 'formalin fixation', 'stainings', 'H&E', 'trichrome', 'Perls', 'reticulin', 'PAS', 'immunostains', 'CD34', 'cytokeratins 7 and 19', 'CRBP1', '-SMA', 'METAVIR score', 'iron overload', 'Searle score', 'Liver iron concentration', 'iron concentration / age ratio', 'METAVIR score', 'CRBP1', '-SMA', 'CRBP', 'CRBP 1']","['November, 2003', 'December 2003']"

He also reported a 6 kg loss of weight during this time, but denied any other constitutional symptoms.
He appeared well, was afebrile, and had no abnormality on chest or abdominal examination. Examination of the right elbow revealed a firm, tender swelling, approximately 2 cm in diameter, over the lateral humeral epicondyle, with associated limitation of elbow flexion to 60 degrees.
Initial investigation with plain XR of the right elbow joint revealed a joint effusion (Figure ). As these findings were non-specific, further evaluation with different imaging modalities was undertaken.
Ultrasound examination of the elbow showed a large joint effusion (Figure ). Scintigraphic imaging with Tc99m three phase bone scanning demonstrated increased blood pool activity, and diffusely increased osteoblastic activity, involving the right elbow joint, particularly the distal humerus and ulna, as well as the distal left radius (Figure ).
CT scan confirmed the presence of cortical erosions involving the right lateral epicondyle of the humerus and the ulna. Further, there was increased attenuation within the proximal medullary shaft of the ulna, and diffuse soft tissue thickening around the proximal ulna and radial head, with an associated joint effusion (Figure ).
Further functional imaging with Thallium 201 chloride revealed intense early uptake in the right lateral epicondyle of the humerus and proximal ulna (Figure ). The delayed 4 hour images demonstrated tracer retention (Figure ). The delayed whole body views showed further abnormal thallium retention involving the mediastinum, para-aortic regions of the abdomen, the left inguinal region and the distal left radius (Figure ).
MR demonstrated erosive changes involving the lateral epicondyle, a loculated joint effusion and thickening and enhancement of the joint capsule and the annular ligament of the superior radio-ulnar joint. These changes suggested either a neoplasm or possibly infection (Figure ).
The patient was therefore referred to the Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma service for further investigation.
Biopsy of the right elbow joint demonstrated chronic synovial inflammation and numerous polymorphonuclear cells in the synovial fluid, but no malignant cells (Figure ). Microbiological examination, including staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi, revealed no organisms.
CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, performed in light of the thallium findings, revealed extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The lymphadenopathy was characterised by peripheral enhancement with prominent central areas of low attenuation (Figures and ).
Subsequent CT guided biopsy of the retroperitoneal lymphoid tissue revealed necrotising granulomatous lymphadenitis indicative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (Figure ). While no acid fast bacilli were visible on Ziehl-Nielsen staining, polymerase chain reaction was positive for M. tuberculosis DNA.

139,1151652-1,15967047,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1151652.xml,Successful management of hamstring injuries in Australian Rules footballers: two case reports,"A 19-year-old male, semi-elite Australian Rules footballer presented with left sided hamstring pain that occurred during a game two weeks prior. The patient had not played a game or been able to train for two weeks since the injury. He had been treated with cryotherapy, NSAID's, slump stretching, lumbar spine mobilizations, ultrasound and massage to the hamstrings. He had a history of mild osteitis pubis 12 months previously that was treated with rest and modified activity. There had been no prior history of hamstring or low back injury.
On physical examination the patient was standing with an apparent lumbar spine hyperlordosis, anterior pelvis tilt, flexed knees and increased thoracic kyphosis. There was tight (reduced range of motion) bilateral hip flexors (modified Thomas position* +15°) and hamstring muscles (45° straight leg raise [SLR]), hypertonicity of the gluteii, hamstring, lumbar and psoas muscles and general mid thoracic and lumbar spine motion restriction, determined by inter-segmental motion palpation and observation of range of motion (ROM). (*Modified Thomas testing requires the patient to sit at the edge of the table and to bring one knee to their chest to firmly flatten their back. They then assume the supine position, allowing the testing leg to extend off the table. An angle is formed between the femur and a line drawn parallel to the tabletop. A positive angle means the femur is projecting upwards. A negative angle means the femur hangs downwards). There was weakness of the left hamstring and gluteus maximus graded 4/5. Hamstring tenderness could not be localized on palpation. Other physical examination findings, including Trendelenburg, valsalva, neurological, slump, extension leg raise and hip and sacroiliac joint motion palpation and orthopedic testing were unremarkable. The patient was given a working diagnosis of back-related hamstring injury as a result of lumbar-pelvic myofascial pain referral, mimicking a grade one hamstring strain. Differential diagnoses included pain referral from gluteal trigger points.
Treatment involved long-lever SMT to the lumbar spine, short-lever SMT to the mid thoracic spine, drop piece knee manipulation, active release soft tissue massage techniques (ART) to the psoas, gluteal, lumbar and hamstring muscles and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching of the hamstring and psoas muscles. Post treatment, modified Thomas position bilaterally was +5°, SLR 60° bilaterally and muscle strength was graded 5/5.
The patient received 3 treatment sessions that week and played a match the next week without re-injury. He was put on a maintenance program for the rest of the 12 weeks of the season including finals (one visit per week for a month, one visit per fortnight thereafter) which included the above treatment and strengthening and muscle activation work (to improve hip extension and abduction motor patterns) to the gluteus maximus and medius, multifidus, transversus abdominus and internal oblique muscles. Maximum medical improvement (MMI) was reached after 7 treatments. The patient finished the season without re-injury.

He presented to us the day after, complaining of tightness in his medial right hamstring and a stiff low back. He had no previous history of hamstring injury but had suffered episodic low back pain over a 5-year period.
On physical examination, the right pelvis was low compared to the left in standing position; there were tight right (45° SLR) and left (55° SLR) hamstrings and tight left hip flexors (+10° modified Thomas position). There was palpable hypertonicity through the right hamstring, left psoas, lumbar and gluteal muscles, thoracolumbar spine and right sacro-iliac joint (SIJ) motion restriction, positive Gillett's (standing S-I joint motion palpation) and extension leg raise testing for the right SIJ and weakness of the right hamstring and gluteus maximus muscles rated 4/5. Hamstring tenderness could not be localized on palpation but mild discomfort was reproduced in resisted muscle testing. Other physical examination findings and testing procedures, including Trendelenburg, valsalva, neurological, slump, lumbar ROM and hip joint motion palpation and orthopedic testing were unremarkable. The patient was diagnosed with a back-related hamstring injury on the basis of his apparent right SIJ motion restriction and pain referral. Differential diagnoses included pain referral from lumbar-pelvic myofascial structures, gluteal trigger points or a grade 1 hamstring injury with concurrent lumbar-pelvic dysfunction.
Treatment involved high velocity low amplitude (HVLA) SMT to the right SIJ and thoracolumbar spine, long axis manipulation to the right hip joint, ART to the right hamstring, left psoas, lumbar and gluteal muscles, PNF stretching of the right hamstring and left psoas and hamstring cryotherapy. Post treatment, modified Thomas position was 0° on the left, SLR 55° on the right and 65° on the left. Muscle strength was graded 5/5.
The patient did not participate in training during the week and received 2 more treatment sessions. He played a match the next weekend without re-injury. He was seen twice the next week and put on a maintenance program for the 16 weeks remaining in the season (one visit per week for a month, one visit per fortnight for a month, one visit per month thereafter).

141,1156865-1,15876349,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1156865.xml,The first case of septicemia due to nontoxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae in Poland: case report,"In January 2004 previously healthy 38-year-old man was admitted to hospital with fever (40°C) and arthralgia of upper and lower extremities. He was not addicted to drugs or alcohol. He smoked about 20 cigarettes per day. Physical examination revealed mild tachycardia with normal cardiac sounds and normal blood pressure. Oral cavity examination showed poor dentition. He presented generalized arthralgia and edema and redness of involved joints. Also there was a 3 day history of papulomacular haemorrhagic rash on his lower extremities. The patient had no symptoms of respiratory tract infection and X-ray examination showed no evidence of pneumonia. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated white blood cell count (17,8 × 103/μl) with 34% of band neutrophils and 51% of granulocytes, decreased platelet count (29 × 103/μl), slightly elevated liver enzymes (AST 52 U/L, ALT 41 U/L, LDH 589 U/L, alkaline phosphate 150 U/L), hyperbilirubinemia (2,69 mg%), elevetad creatinine concentration (1,51 mg%), mild proteinuria, leucocyturia and erythrocyturia. The initial diagnosis was septicemia. Three blood samples were drawn during two first days of hospitalization for microbiological evaluation and empirical therapy with ceftazidime and teicoplanin was started.
Nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae biotype gravis was isolated from all blood cultures. On the third day of treatment the antibiotics were changed to amikacin and ciprofloxacin according to antibiogram. Despite resolution of most symptoms and negative blood and throat swab cultures after eight days of treatment the patient was still febrile. For that reason ciprofloxacin was changed to clindamycin.
Transthoracic and transoesopharyngeal echocardiography performed on the 13th day of treatment showed two vegetations attached to the mitral and aortal valves. The patient underwent surgery for replacement of both valves. The cultures from vegetations were negative. After the operation the patient recovered. Although the cultures were negative we have supposed that the vegetations were caused by C. diphtheriae because the patient had no cardiac troubles before bacteremia.
Nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae biotype gravis isolated from blood cultures was identified and biotyped with use of morphological and biochemical methods as described elsewhere. Toxin production was examined in vitro by the conventional [] and modified Elek test []. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of diphtheria toxin gene [,] and the PCR result was negative.
The susceptibility of isolates to 13 antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method accordingly to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards [] guidelines on Mueller-Hinton II blood agar (supplemented with 5% sheep blood). However NCCLS does not define breakpoints for Corynebacterium sp. For that reason interpretation was done comparatively as for Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., because some breakpoints are different for that genera. The antimicrobial disks contained penicillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefazolin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, amikacin, meropenem, azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin and teicoplanin. Determination of MIC (results are shown in brackets) for ampicillin (0.5 mg/L), gentamicin (0.38 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (0.125 mg/L), clindamycin (0.25 mg/L), erythromycin (0.016 mg/L), chloramphenicol (2 mg/L) and tetracycline (0.5 mg/L) was done using E-test strips. Clindamycin and erythromycin MIC breakpoints for Streptococcus spp. are lower than for Staphylococcus spp. but both interpretations showed susceptibility of examined C. diphtheriae strain. Ampicillin MIC breakpoints pointed to investigated strain as ampicillin resistant. The strain was also resistant to penicillin and ceftazidime and intermediate to cefuroxime axetil and ceftriaxone.","[[38.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['upper and lower extremities', 'cardiac', 'Oral cavity', 'joints', 'lower extremities', 'respiratory tract', 'respiratory tract', 'liver', 'throat', 'mitral', 'aortal valves', 'both valves', 'cardiac']","['fever', 'arthralgia', 'addicted to drugs or alcohol', 'tachycardia', 'normal cardiac sounds', 'normal blood pressure', 'poor dentition', 'arthralgia', 'edema', 'redness of involved joints', 'papulomacular haemorrhagic rash', 'respiratory tract infection', 'pneumonia', 'elevated liver enzymes', 'elevetad creatinine concentration', 'proteinuria', 'leucocyturia', 'erythrocyturia', 'septicemia', 'Nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae biotype gravis', 'symptoms', 'febrile', 'vegetations', 'vegetations', 'vegetations', 'C. diphtheriae', 'cardiac troubles', 'bacteremia', 'Nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae biotype gravis', 'Corynebacterium sp.', 'Streptococcus spp', 'Staphylococcus spp', 'Streptococcus spp', 'Staphylococcus spp', 'C. diphtheriae strain', 'strain', 'strain']","['ceftazidime', 'teicoplanin', 'amikacin', 'ciprofloxacin', 'ciprofloxacin', 'clindamycin', 'sheep blood', 'penicillin', 'cefaclor', 'cefuroxime axetil', 'cefazolin', 'ceftazidime', 'ceftriaxone', 'cefepime', 'amikacin', 'meropenem', 'azithromycin', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'vancomycin', 'teicoplanin', 'ampicillin', 'gentamicin', 'ciprofloxacin', 'clindamycin', 'erythromycin', 'chloramphenicol', 'tetracycline', 'Clindamycin', 'erythromycin', 'penicillin', 'ceftazidime', 'cefuroxime axetil', 'ceftriaxone']","['January 2004', '38', '13th', 'Mueller-Hinton']","['Physical examination', 'blood pressure', 'X-ray', 'X-ray examination', 'Laboratory', 'white blood cell count', 'band neutrophils', 'granulocytes', 'platelet count', 'liver enzymes', 'AST', 'ALT', 'LDH', 'alkaline phosphate', 'hyperbilirubinemia', 'creatinine concentration', 'blood samples', 'microbiological evaluation', 'empirical therapy', 'blood cultures', 'antibiotics', 'antibiogram', 'blood and throat swab cultures', 'Transthoracic and transoesopharyngeal echocardiography', 'surgery for replacement of both valves', 'replacement of both valves', 'cultures', 'cultures', 'blood cultures', 'Toxin production', 'conventional', 'modified Elek test', 'Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)', 'PCR', 'diphtheria toxin gene', 'PCR', 'Mueller-Hinton II blood agar', 'antimicrobial disks', 'MIC', 'E-test strips', 'Clindamycin', 'erythromycin', 'MIC breakpoints', 'Ampicillin MIC breakpoints']","['3 day', '13th day of treatment']"
142,1156897-1,15943886,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1156897.xml,Fatal meningitis in a previously healthy young adult caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 38: an emerging serotype?,"On December 22, 2001, an 18-year-old male in his eighth week of Marine Corps basic training presented to the field medical station with headache and an episode of vomiting after physical training.
His neurological symptoms progressed over the next several hours until he became disoriented and unresponsive. He was evaluated in the local hospital emergency department where a fever of 39.1C (102.5F) and disorientation to person, place, and time were observed. Lumbar puncture performed during medical evaluation revealed an opening pressure greater than 500 mm; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was milky white, with a glucose concentration of 3 mg/dl and total protein of 269 mg/dl. White count in the CSF was 4444 with 91% segmented neutrophils, and microscopic evaluation of the CSF revealed Gram-positive diplococci. A presumptive diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis was made; intravenous ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and vancomycin were initiated. Despite these measures, the patient's condition remained unimproved. He was transferred to the intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital on ventilator support. Intravenous dexamethasone was initiated; antibiotics and supportive care were continued. He died approximately 30 hours after his initial presentation to the field medical station.
The patient had no previous history of meningitis, neurologic abnormalities or other medical problems. Prior to onset of his illness, there was no history of head trauma, and he was taking no medications. He received a meningococcal vaccination (Menomune A/C/Y/W135, Aventis Pasteur) on October 31, 2001. He had no history of receiving pneumococcal vaccination.
Blood and CSF cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, sensitive to all antibiotics tested. Streptococcal culture of the throat was negative.
A pneumococcal isolate from the blood was sent to the Respiratory Disease Laboratory at NHRC for additional evaluation. Serotyping was performed using a modified version of the latex agglutination typing method []. Samples were tested against antisera for vaccine-covered serotypes (Statens Serum Institut, Denmark) and results confirmed using the classic Quellung reaction and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) technique.
For MLST, chromosomal DNA was extracted using spin DNA extraction columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A subsequent PCR reaction was carried out in 100-μl volumes, using primer pairs developed by Enright and Spratt []. Each of the primer pairs amplify an internal fragment of 7 housekeeping genes: aroE, gdh, gki, recP, spi, xpt, and ddl. Amplified DNA fragments were purified using QIAquick purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and directly sequenced in each direction on an automated sequencer with Big Dye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Allelic matches at each loci were determined through a search engine at the pneumococcal MLST Web site .
Using the classic serotyping methods outlined, the isolate did not react with any of the 23-valent vaccine-specific typing antisera. Molecular investigation utilizing MLST demonstrated an allelic profile that matched sequence type 393. Using the MLST database, this sequence type matched a likely pneumococcal serotype 38 (PS38). The latex agglutination was repeated using antisera against this serotype, and results were confirmatory.
PS38 is not covered by the current 23-valent polysaccharide or the 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine formulations, which include pneumococcal serotypes that are considered the most common causes of invasive and antibiotic-resistant infections in the US. Given the fatal outcome in this case and the importance of vaccine formulations being appropriately targeted, the medical literature was explored to evaluate pneumococcal disease caused by PS38 in the US and outside the US. Particular emphasis was placed on temporal trends and documented cases of meningitis caused by this serotype.
Within the US, relatively few cases of PS38 disease have been reported. A few reported PS38 carriage isolates were found (3/235, 1.3%) from Alabama 1975 to 1978, but no cases of PS38 were among the 105 invasive isolates tested []. From 1985 to 1989 in Alabama, no PS38 was noted among 303 cases of meningitis or bacteremia, and only 2 cases were found among 228 cases of otitis media []. Black and colleagues reported two cases of invasive PS38 disease in children attending clinics in northern California from October 1995 to August 1998 []. A comprehensive analysis of pneumococcal isolates recovered from patients with invasive disease in the US in 1999 was performed by Gertz and colleagues. Among 1,168 isolates examined, only 5 were identified as PS38 (0.4%) []. More recently, three of 185 (1.6%) invasive isolates, and only 8/1379 (0.6%) carriage isolates were found to be PS38 among isolates from Alaska, 1998 to 2002 []. Given the invasive:carriage ratio of this and other analyzed studies, this report concluded that although the invasive potential of PS38 was similar to other vaccine serotypes, the carriage was so low that the significance of serious infections caused by PS38 was minimal at that time. Although not specified, meningitis was likely among these few documented invasive illnesses caused by PS38 within the US.
In a large review of the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs) performed by Robinson and colleagues from 1995 to 1998, serotype 38 was not mentioned among the top 14 serotypes []. Likewise, numerous other studies failed to reveal PS38 among the reported contributing serotypes [,].
Cases of invasive PS38 disease have been reported in Australia, Spain, England, and Canada in recent years [-]. One Australian study identified 7 (12.4%) cases of invasive PS38 disease in non-indigenous adolescents, making PS38 the second most common non-vaccine covered serotype identified in this population []. Of particular interest is the study of pneumococcal isolates causing local and invasive disease in Spain from January 1997 to June 2001. Unlike the previous studies, a strain of PS38 was identified that was resistant to penicillin (MIC > 0.06 mg/L) [].
In addition to causing invasive pneumococcal infections, PS38 has been found in isolates from children with acute otitis media in the Czech Republic [] and from nasopharyngeal swabs in a study of pneumococcal carriage in Canadian children attending daycare from 1995 to 1996 []. In the study of pneumococcal carriage, PS38 ranked the 14th most common serotype, with 8 out of 589 (1.36%) isolates positive for PS38.
In contrast to these small studies with recognized PS38 disease or carriage, numerous other comprehensive reports from outside the US failed to demonstrate a burden. A review of over 70 global data sets performed by Hausdorff and colleagues failed to reveal PS38 among the top 25 serotypes identified among children; however, PS38 did rank #23 out of the top 24 isolates identified from adults []. In a paired report, Hausdorff did not assign significance to PS38 as he evaluated the disease manifestations of the top 16 global pneumococcal serotypes []. Likewise, in subsequent studies, PS38 was not mentioned among isolates of importance for otitis media or for invasive disease in the literature outside the US [,,]. More recently, among invasive isolates considered: 150 from studies in Oxford, England, 1995–2001 []; 92 from Iceland, 1992–2001 []; 69 from Toronto, 1995 []; 112 from Kenya, 1992–1996 [], and 56 from Papau New Guinea, 1981–1987 [], PS38 was again not among the serotypes identified.
Among reports of studies outside the US that specifically address meningitis cases caused by PS38, Table summarizes reports from Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. The prevalence of PS38-associated meningitis ranged from 0.2% in South Africa to 5.6% in Southern India. Of the cases with reported antibiotic sensitivities, all were penicillin-susceptible [,]. In four of the five reports, PS38 meningitis was among the 23 most common serotypes reported [-].
Of the PS38 disease reported outside the US, invasive pneumococcal disease was not uncommon. Additionally, even though most PS38 isolates tested were pan-sensitive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, antibiotics can be ineffective in a rapidly fulminating infection.

Cataract extraction had been performed two years previously in the right eye through a 3.2 mm limbal incision. An uncomplicated penetrating keratoplasty was performed, with an 8.25 mm donor cornea secured into an 8 mm recipient opening with 16 interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures. On the first postoperative day, the graft demonstrated diffuse 3+–4+ stromal edema and a nearly complete epithelial defect. The anterior chamber was deep, and no aqueous leakage was noted from either the wound or suture tracks. The epithelial defect resolved in the first postoperative week, although 1+–2+ stromal edema persisted. As the graft remained edematous 4 weeks later, the patient was diagnosed with PGF, and a repeat penetrating keratoplasty was performed 5 weeks after the primary graft. Three years later, the second graft remains clear, with a central pachymetry of 495 μm, and corrected visual acuity of 20/25+.
The host corneal button removed at the initial penetrating keratoplasty and the failed donor corneal button were formalin-fixed and analyzed with light microscopy after staining with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson trichrome stains. Histopathologic examination of the host corneal button revealed stromal edema, thickening and excrescences of Descemet's membrane, and a decreased number of endothelial cells, consistent with Fuchs' corneal dystrophy. Histopathologic examination of the failed corneal graft revealed a markedly thickened stroma and near complete absence of endothelial cells. Both sides of the excised donor corneal button were covered with epithelial cells, consistent with epithelial downgrowth. (Figure ) The corneal sections containing suture tracks were stained with the periodic acid Schiff stain to demonstrate Descemet's membrane. (Figure ) The suture tracks passed through the true epithelial layer, Bowman's layer, and extended into the stroma, confirming that the button had not been inverted when secured into the recipient opening. Additionally, serial sectioning of the host corneal button failed to demonstrate the presence of epithelial cells on the posterior corneal surface.
To investigate the possibility of HSV infection of the donor cornea, which has been associated with one-third of cases of PGF [,], PCR analysis of the donor corneal button for HSV DNA was performed. Positive and negative controls confirmed adequate extraction of purified DNA from the failed donor corneal button, as well as the sensitivity and specificity of the HSV primers used. PCR analysis for HSV DNA was negative in the donor corneal button.
A complete review of the first donor's medical and eye bank records was performed. The tissue was obtained through the University of California, San Francisco tissue bank from a 56 year-old female donor who died from a myocardial infarction and cardiac tamponade. Routinely performed serologic screening tests and biomicroscopic examination of the donor button were unremarkable. The endothelial cell count was 2852 cells/mm2, and death to preservation was 12 hours, with a 51-hour preservation time in Optisol-GS.
The paired donor cornea was transplanted into another recipient several hours after this patient's original transplant. This cornea also appeared unremarkable on biomicroscopic examination, remained in Optisol-GS for 53 hours prior to transplantation, and had a cell count of 2841 cells/mm2. Five months later, after a similar 16 interrupted suture technique, the graft was clear and compact with central corneal pachymetry of 538 μm.","[[59.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['corneal', 'right eye', 'right eye', 'limbal', 'cornea', 'stromal', 'epithelial', 'anterior chamber', 'wound', 'suture tracks', 'epithelial', 'corneal', 'corneal', 'corneal button', 'stromal', ""Descemet's membrane"", 'endothelial cells', 'corneal', 'corneal', 'stroma', 'corneal', 'corneal button', 'corneal sections', 'epithelial layer', ""Bowman's layer"", 'stroma', 'corneal button', 'posterior corneal surface', 'cornea', 'corneal button', 'corneal button', 'myocardial', 'cardiac', 'donor button', 'cornea', 'central corneal']","[""Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy"", 'pseudophakic corneal edema', 'Cataract', 'stromal edema', 'epithelial defect', 'anterior chamber was deep', 'deep', 'aqueous leakage', 'epithelial defect', 'stromal edema', 'edema', 'graft remained edematous', 'PGF', 'second graft remains clear', 'stromal edema', 'thickening', 'excrescences', 'decreased number of endothelial cells', ""Fuchs' corneal dystrophy"", 'thickened stroma', 'endothelial cells', 'Both sides of the excised donor corneal button were covered with epithelial cells', 'epithelial cells', 'epithelial downgrowth', 'corneal sections containing suture tracks', 'suture tracks', ""Descemet's membrane"", ""suture tracks passed through the true epithelial layer, Bowman's layer, and extended into the stroma"", 'button had not been inverted', 'epithelial cells', 'HSV infection of the donor cornea', 'PGF', 'adequate extraction of purified DNA', 'HSV DNA', 'died', 'myocardial infarction', 'cardiac tamponade', 'death', 'cornea also appeared unremarkable', 'unremarkable', 'graft was clear and compact']",['Descemet'],"['59', '20/50', '20/25', 'Bowman', 'eye bank', 'University of California', 'San Francisco tissue bank', '56']","['visual acuity', 'Cataract extraction', 'limbal incision', 'uncomplicated penetrating keratoplasty', 'penetrating keratoplasty', '8.25 mm donor cornea secured into an 8 mm recipient opening with 16 interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures', 'graft', 'penetrating keratoplasty', 'central pachymetry', 'corrected visual acuity', 'host corneal button removed at the initial penetrating keratoplasty', 'failed donor corneal button were formalin-fixed', 'light microscopy', 'staining', 'hematoxylin', 'eosin', 'periodic acid-Schiff', 'Masson trichrome stains', 'Histopathologic examination', 'Histopathologic examination of the host corneal button', 'Histopathologic examination', 'Histopathologic examination of the failed corneal graft', 'corneal graft', 'periodic acid Schiff stain', 'serial sectioning of the host corneal button', 'PCR analysis of the donor corneal button for HSV DNA', 'PCR analysis for HSV DNA', 'serologic screening tests', 'biomicroscopic examination of the donor button', 'endothelial cell count', 'paired donor cornea was transplanted into another recipient', 'transplant', 'biomicroscopic examination', 'Optisol-GS', 'cell count', '16 interrupted suture technique', 'central corneal pachymetry']","['two years previously', 'postoperative day', 'first postoperative week', '4 weeks later', '5 weeks after the primary graft', 'Three years later', 'prior to transplantation', 'Five months later']"

The clinical diagnosis of acute cerebral ischaemia in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory was made by a neurologist. A cranial CT-scan showed no early signs of cerebral infarct and no intracranial bleeding. Atrial fibrillation was recognised on the initial ECG and an cerebral infarct of cardiac embolic origin was assumed. The patient had no history of stroke but suffered from coronary heart disease and sustained an anterior cardiac wall infarction in the past. Further known vascular risk factors were hypertension and smoking. Even so, the patient took no medication at the time of admission.
Thrombolysis with 70 mg rt-PA (0.9 mg/kg) was started two hours after the onset of symptoms. The neurological status during and after rt-PA treatment remained unchanged. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed 12 hours after initiation of thrombolytic therapy revealed a moderately reduced left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction: 41%), left ventricular regional dyssynergy, and no intracardiac thrombus.
The D-Dimer antigen plasma concentration as a marker of coagulation activation was raised 24 hours after rt-PA treatment and showed a tendency to normalisation during the following days.
Extracranial Duplexsonography revealed moderate arteriosclerotic plaque formation in the carotid bulb on both sides but no hemodynamic stenosis of the carotid and vertebral arteries. Using transcranial duplexsonography a severe stenosis was found in the proximal segment of the left middle cerebral artery. No diabetes or hyperlipidaemia were diagnosed. Cerebral MRI, twenty-four hours after lysis revealed a cortical infarct with a clinically asymptomatic haemorrhagic transformation in the left-sided MCA territory. Antithrombotic treatment with subcutaneous low-dose heparin (Dalteparin 2/d) was initiated 24 hours after thrombolysis. The fluid balance was continuously monitored and kept net 0 ml/24 hours to avoid fluid overload.
On the 3rd day after admission, the patient developed acute dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, and an elevated blood pressure. Acute myocardial infarction was excluded on the basis of ECG and blood tests (CK, CK-MB, Troponin were normal). A CT-scan detected no pulmonary embolism, but massive bilateral pleural effusion. TTE revealed an apical thrombus measuring 2.0 × 2.0 cm in the left ventricle (figure ) with left ventricular ejection fraction reduced to 20%. The thrombus, was fixed to the hypokinetic anteroseptal wall. Serial TTE performed two days later revealed complete resolution of the thrombus and hypokinesia; with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%. In the mean time the patient recovered from the acute cardiac decompensation.

Clinical examination revealed large ecchymoses over both upper and lower limbs as well as oral mucosal bleeding without any evidence of petechiae. The patient was apyrexial and vital signs were all within normal limits. There were no other significant findings on cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examination.
Laboratory analysis revealed INR 2.7 (normal range: 0.9–1.3), APTT 73 sec (25–38) D-dimer 25 μg/mL (0–0.2), fibrinogen <0.05 g/L (1.5–4.0), platelets 25 × 109/L (150–400), consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Computerised tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax and abdomen revealed a lesion within the right ventricle (Figure ) without other evidence of metastatic disease within the pulmonary or hepatic parenchyma. The primary site appeared necrotic consistent with recent radiotherapy. Trans-oesophageal echocardiography showed that the lesion extended into the body of the right ventricle and significantly reduced ventricular volume (Figure ). The edges of the lesion were fimbriated and mobile, consistent with a metastatic deposit. Although the platelet count and clotting improved with Vitamin K and plasma, the platelet count did not rise above 50. This was adequate in controlling her haematuria and further treatments were therefore not initiated. As the patient did not show any overt signs of thrombosis, we did not institute therapy with anticoagulants.

She had no past history of psychiatric illness. Her chief complaints were contamination obsessions and washing compulsions in the preceding one month. Preoccupied with thoughts of contamination, she had started spending the majority of time washing herself or cleaning various household items. She described these thoughts as being her own and recognised them to be ""irrational"", but she could not resist them. She was distressed and unable to maintain her employment. Washing compulsions relieved her anxiety. However, she could not offer an explanation as to what she feared about contamination. No depressive or psychotic symptoms were elicited. Biochemical investigations, including metabolic and thyroid function studies, were in the normal range. She was diagnosed with OCD according to ICD-10 criteria [].
Pharmacotherapy, offered at the first consultation, was refused by the patient because of her (non-obsessional) concerns about teratogenic effects of drugs. Behavioural therapy in the form of thought stopping was begun. The patient reported exacerbation of symptoms at the next consultation and subsequently disclosed that her obsessional thoughts also concerned the fear of contaminating her unborn baby. She repeatedly washed to avoid damage to her foetus. One month after her initial presentation, fluoxetine was started, at an initial dose of 20 mg/day gradually and gradually increased to 60 mg/day over the next four weeks. The patient reported reduction of obsessional and compulsive symptoms, and was able to resume her work. She remained on fluoxetine until the eighth month of pregnancy with no reports of exacerbation. However, the patient stopped the medication during the last month of gestation on the alleged advice of family members. The patient again experienced the relapse of intrusive obsessional thoughts followed by compulsions, but refused to resume pharmacotherapy until delivery.

Colonoscopy revealed eight hyperplastic to adenomatous polyps ranging in size from 0.6 to 3.0 cm scattered through the colon, and a four cm, locally invasive, ulcerative rectal adenocarcinoma five cm from the anus. The clinical impression was attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP), with a germline heterozygous truncating APC mutation at codon 215 (CAG to TAG; Gln to stop). The first sample for methylation analysis (Day 1) was a biopsy of normal appearing sigmoid colon.
The patient received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of three, two week cycles of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil, with the last cycle ending two weeks before colectomy. The patient exhibited Grade 3 toxicity with mucositis, stomatitis, diarrhea, and parasthesia. He also received radiation therapy to the pelvis (2,500 centigrays over five days), ending 19 days before colectomy. The specimens obtained for analysis were outside of the primary radiation field.
Colectomy revealed approximately 50 scattered small hyperplastic to adenomatous polyps (0.1 to 0.3 cm), and a 0.7 cm ulcerative lesion at the site of the rectal adenocarcinoma containing a few residual neoplastic glands with superficial invasion of the muscularis propria. Lymph nodes were negative for metastatic carcinoma. The second specimen for analysis (Day 62) was taken from a normal appearing region of the sigmoid colon.
Individual crypts were isolated from the first (a colonoscopic biopsy) and last (a 1–2 cm2 patch of mucosa) specimens using an EDTA-containing solution as previously described []. DNA, extracted from individual crypts placed in microfuge tubes, was bisulphite treated (to convert C's to U's, whereas methylated-C's are unchanged), and amplified by PCR at two different CpG rich regions called CSX (nine different crypts) and BGN (eight of the same crypts). PCR products were cloned into bacterial vectors and eight clones representing individual PCR products were sequenced from each crypt [].
Crypt patterns (5' to 3' order of methylation) before and after neo-adjuvant therapy were complex and seemingly random, consistent with stochastic epigenetic errors (Figure ). The CSX (cardiac specific homeobox) sequence or ""tag"" is autosomal (5q34, also called Mint23 []) and has eight CpG sites located in the 3' untranslated region and 256 possible patterns ([]8 possible 5' to 3' orders of methylation). The BGN (biglycan) tag is on the X-chromosome (Xq28, one allele per male cell) and has nine CpG sites located just distal to the promoter and 512 ([]9) possible patterns. These tags are not expressed in the colon and therefore any methylation is unlikely to confer selection []. Crypt methylation patterns are summarized by two statistics: percent methylation (proportion of methylated CpG sites) and diversity or numbers of unique tags per eight sampled from each crypt.
Methylation tag values differed between crypts sampled before and after neo-adjuvant therapy, but these differences were not significant and did not follow a trend (Figure ). Average CSX tag values were lower and BGN tags values were higher after neo-adjuvant therapy. A model [] in which random methylation errors start to accumulate from birth is consistent with the lack of significant tag differences between serial specimens and the observed crypt variations. The model can be simulated on a computer (using previously published human colon crypt parameters []) to estimate average tag values and intervals that include 95% of simulated individual crypt outcomes (Figure ). Different crypts within the same colon may have different methylation patterns because errors are stochastic and independent between cells and CpG sites. Methylation patterns before and after neo-adjuvant therapy are predicted to be similar because additional errors acquired in the 62 days between the samples are relatively insignificant compared to the 22 years since birth. Observed crypt tag values were generally consistent with the predictions of the model (Figure ).
In addition to numbers of divisions since birth, methylation patterns (Figure ) may also record stem cell dynamics. For example, crypt diversity or unique tags per crypt appears to reflect crypt stem cell numbers []. This AFAP patient appeared to have normal numbers of crypt stem cells because his crypt diversity (3.22 and 2.33 average unique CSX crypt tags) was consistent with a normal colon (Figure ). In contrast, significantly greater crypt diversity has been observed in some familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients, with an average of 3.9 unique CSX tags per FAP crypt compared to 3.0 with non-FAP crypts, which translates to about 4-fold more FAP crypt stem cells []. Greater numbers of crypt stem cells correlate with germline APC mutations around the mutation cluster region (MCR) that remove some but not all β-catenin binding repeats []. Consistent with this observation, this patient had a truncating germline mutation (Codon 215, CAG (Gln) to TAG (stop)) that removed all β-catenin binding repeats.","[[22.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['colon', 'rectal', 'five cm from the anus', 'codon 215', 'sigmoid colon', 'pelvis', 'site of the rectal adenocarcinoma', 'muscularis propria', 'Lymph nodes', 'sigmoid colon', 'crypts', 'patch of mucosa', 'mucosa', 'CSX', 'BGN', 'distal to the promoter', 'colon', 'Crypt', 'colon', 'crypts within the same colon', 'cells', 'CpG sites', 'colon', 'crypt']","['anemia', 'hyperplastic to adenomatous polyps', 'ulcerative rectal adenocarcinoma', 'familial adenomatous polyposis', 'AFAP', 'germline heterozygous truncating APC mutation', 'normal appearing sigmoid colon', 'toxicity', 'mucositis', 'stomatitis', 'diarrhea', 'parasthesia', 'hyperplastic to adenomatous polyps', 'ulcerative lesion', 'neoplastic glands', 'superficial invasion of the muscularis propria', 'metastatic carcinoma', 'normal appearing region of the sigmoid colon', 'Crypt patterns', 'stochastic epigenetic errors', 'CSX (cardiac specific homeobox) sequence or ""tag"" is autosomal', 'tag"" is autosomal', ""eight CpG sites located in the 3' untranslated region"", 'BGN (biglycan) tag is on the X-chromosome', 'BGN (biglycan) tag is on the X-chromosome (Xq28, one allele per male cell)', 'nine CpG sites located just distal to the promoter', 'tags are not expressed in the colon', 'methylation', 'different methylation patterns', 'Methylation patterns', 'stem cell dynamics', 'normal numbers of crypt stem cells', 'crypt diversity', 'normal colon', 'greater crypt diversity', 'crypt diversity', 'familial adenomatous polyposis', 'FAP', 'CSX tags per FAP crypt', 'non-FAP crypts', 'FAP crypt stem cells', 'Greater numbers of crypt stem cells', 'truncating germline mutation', 'Codon 215']","['oxaliplatin', '5-fluorouracil', 'EDTA-containing', 'bisulphite']",['22'],"['Colonoscopy', 'methylation analysis', 'biopsy', 'neo-adjuvant chemotherapy', 'colectomy', 'radiation therapy', 'radiation therapy to the pelvis', 'colectomy', 'Colectomy', 'analysis', 'Individual crypts were isolated from the first (a colonoscopic biopsy) and last (a 1–2 cm2 patch of mucosa) specimens using an EDTA-containing solution', 'DNA', 'amplified by PCR', 'PCR', 'PCR', 'PCR', 'Crypt patterns', 'neo-adjuvant therapy', 'Crypt methylation patterns', 'Methylation tag', 'Methylation tag values', 'neo-adjuvant therapy', 'Average CSX tag values', 'BGN tags values', 'neo-adjuvant therapy', 'neo-adjuvant therapy', 'crypt tag values', 'methylation patterns', 'AFAP', 'average unique CSX crypt tags']",[]

She was the second of a pair of twins. Her twin sister and another younger sister are both affected. There is no consanguinity in the family. She underwent splenectomy at age 5 years due to persistent thrombocytopenia, but the diagnosis of Gaucher disease was established only after a bone marrow examination at age 11 years. Her leukocytes β-glucocerebrosidase activity checked at age 26 years was 1.56 nmol/mg/h (normal: >28.42 nmol/mg/h). At that time, she had severe bone deformities, hepatomegaly, anemia, clubbing fingers and toes, but pink lips. There was no audible heart murmur, and her breathing sound was clear. Her liver size was measured 5 cm below subcostal margin at right mid-clavicular line, and neither spider angiomata nor superficial vein engorgement was found. Hemogram revealed a platelet count of 103 × 109/L and hemoglobin level of 9.6 mg/dL. DNA analysis of this patient and her two affected siblings all revealed a V375L/L444P genotype of the β-glucocerebrosidase gene.
The patient complained of bilateral orbital pain with gradual protrusion of eyes since 30 years old. Thyroid function tests, including T3, T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone and free T4, showed normal results. Ophthalmologic examinations failed to reveal any specific findings related to the exophthalmos. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the eyes revealed increases in retrobulbar space with fat-like density and mild hypertrophy of extra-ocular muscles (Fig. ). She received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with imiglucerase (Cerezyme) at a dose of 60 U/kg every two weeks since 32 years old. Her exophthalmos progressed slightly during the first year of ERT, and then started to regress. Exposure conjunctivitis still bothered her currently.
The patient suffered from intermittent dyspnea at age 34 years. She became cyanotic and had an oxygen saturation of 85% as measured by pulse oximeter. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.41, carbon dioxide tension of 27.9 mmHg, and oxygen tension of 61.2 mmHg in room air. A grade III/VI bruit was audible over the right lower chest, and a chest x-ray revealed prominent pulmonary conus and increased infiltration over the right lower lung field (Fig. ). A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest suspected an AVM with engorged right inferior pulmonary artery and its draining veins (Fig. ); but no focal lesions were found in the lung parenchyma. Right pulmonary artery angiogram showed several dilated and tortuous vessels from the right pulmonary artery, which directly connected to vessels draining into the right pulmonary vein over the right lower lobe of the lung (Fig. ). Early appearance of contrast medium in the right pulmonary vein indicated the presence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. The patient's pulmonary artery pressures were 48/19 mmHg (mean, 33 mmHg). Embolization was achieved with 6 coils, and resulted in a rise of oxygen saturation to 96%, although residual shunt was still present. Unfortunately, two months later, dyspnea and cyanosis recurred, and her oxygen saturation dropped to 85% in room air. A pulmonary function test at that time revealed moderately severe restrictive lung disease.","[[34.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['bone', 'lower extremities', 'bone', 'bone marrow', 'bone', 'fingers', 'toes', 'lips', 'heart', 'liver', 'subcostal margin at right mid-clavicular line', 'superficial vein', 'bilateral orbital', 'eyes', 'Thyroid', 'eyes', 'retrobulbar space', 'extra-ocular muscles', 'Arterial', 'right lower chest', 'chest', 'pulmonary conus', 'right lower lung field', 'chest', 'right inferior pulmonary artery', 'draining veins', 'lung parenchyma', 'vessels', 'right pulmonary artery', 'vessels', 'right pulmonary vein over the right lower lobe of the lung', 'right pulmonary vein', 'pulmonary arteriovenous', 'pulmonary artery', 'pulmonary', 'lung']","['Gaucher disease', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'bone diseases', 'fractures of the lower extremities', 'bone crisis', 'consanguinity', 'thrombocytopenia', 'Gaucher disease', 'bone deformities', 'hepatomegaly', 'anemia', 'clubbing', 'clubbing fingers and toes', 'pink lips', 'audible heart murmur', 'breathing sound was clear', 'spider angiomata', 'superficial vein engorgement', 'bilateral orbital pain', 'protrusion of eyes', 'specific findings related to the exophthalmos', 'exophthalmos', 'increases in retrobulbar space', 'fat-like density', 'hypertrophy of extra-ocular muscles', 'exophthalmos', 'Exposure conjunctivitis', 'dyspnea', 'cyanotic', 'bruit', 'prominent pulmonary conus', 'infiltration over the right lower lung field', 'AVM', 'engorged right inferior pulmonary artery', 'focal lesions', 'dilated', 'tortuous vessels', 'vessels draining', 'Early appearance of contrast medium', 'pulmonary arteriovenous malformation', 'residual shunt', 'dyspnea', 'cyanosis', 'restrictive lung disease']","['imiglucerase', 'Cerezyme']","['34', '5', '11', '26', '30', '32', '34']","['splenectomy', 'bone marrow examination', 'liver size', 'Hemogram', 'platelet count', 'hemoglobin level', 'DNA analysis', 'Thyroid function tests', 'T3', 'T4', 'thyroid-stimulating hormone', 'free T4', 'Ophthalmologic examinations', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the eyes', 'MRI', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'ERT', 'ERT', 'oxygen saturation', 'pulse oximeter', 'Arterial blood gas analysis', 'pH', 'carbon dioxide tension', 'oxygen tension', 'chest x-ray', 'high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest', 'Right pulmonary artery angiogram', 'pulmonary artery pressures', 'Embolization was achieved with 6 coils', 'oxygen saturation', 'oxygen saturation', 'pulmonary function test']","['At that time', 'At that time', 'At that time', 'At that time', 'At that time', 'since 30 years old', 'first year', 'currently', 'two months later', 'two months later', 'at that time']"

Her previous pregnancy was terminated at 40 weeks, with vaginal delivery in May 1991. After a few months of abnormal uterine bleeding, she underwent dilatation and curettage and then a total abdominal hysterectomy (2 months before referral). Histology of the resected specimen revealed choriocarcinoma.
Upon her first visit to our clinic, she was in respiratory distress, and had cough with bloody sputum. Physical examination revealed no abnormal finding except wheezing. Chest X-ray and computerized tomographic (CT) scan showed multiple metastatic nodules in both lungs parenchyma (Figure ). Abdominal and pelvic CT was normal. Histology was reviewed by two expert pathologists in our center, and PSTT was confirmed (Figure ). Serum β-hCG level was 210 mIU/ml. Serial serum β-hCG ranged between 170 – 250, and increased after 3 courses of combination chemotherapy with methotrexate, actinomycin and cyclophosphamide.
Three years later, in november 1994, the patient was given three cycles of EMA chemotherapy. However, due to plateau titer of β-hCG the chemotherapy regimen was changed to EMA-CE. Reassessment of staging work-up was performed using pelvic ultrasonography that revealed a hypoechoic mass in right ovary (42 mm). At the end of six courses of EMA-CE chemotherapy, serum β-hCG remained at 50 mIu/ml.
In May 1995, patient underwent laparotomy and right oophrectomy one month following which the serum β-hCG was negative.

He had a past medical history of SSc diagnosed 3 years before and pulmonary fibrosis. He was on prednisolone and azathioprine. There was no history of liver disease or alcohol abuse.
On examination his blood pressure of 95/65 mmHg, pulse 90/min. He had bilateral fine inspiratory crackles. The abdomen was soft and non-tender. Rectal examination revealed melaena.
White blood count was 12,700/mm3, haemoglobin 10.9 g/dl, platelets 186,000/mm3 and MCV 99.4 fl. Blood urea was 12.5 mmol/l, creatinine 68 μmol/l, electrolytes were normal, glucose 6.3 mmol/l. Serum alanine aminotransferase was 12 u/l, bilirubin 12 μmol/l, γ-glutamyl transferase 54 u/l, alkaline phosphatase 35 u/l, total protein 52 g/l, albumin 27 g/l and C-reactive protein 12. Coagulation studies were normal. Factor V Leiden mutation was not present. Hepatitis viral serology and autoantibody screen were negative and α-1-antitrypsin was normal. Ferritin was 103 μmol/l, caeruloplasmin was 0.25 μmol/l and α-fetoprotein was 0.9 kU/L.
Urgent gastroscopy revealed oesophageal varices, fresh blood and clots in the stomach. During the procedure the oesophageal varices started bleeding. Haemostasis was not achieved despite sclerotherapy and therefore a Sengstaken tube was inserted. The patient was admitted to the High Dependency Unit and commenced on intravenous glypressin, antibiotics and was transfused four units of blood. The following day a repeat gastroscopy showed two columns of grade II oesophageal varices, two oesophageal ulcers (probably secondary to sclerotherapy) and mild portal gastropathy.
Ultrasound scan of the abdomen revealed a small liver with coarse texture and no focal lesion. Hepato-portal flow was demonstrated in the portal vein. The common bile duct was of normal caliber. The spleen was enlarged (bipolar length 12.8 cm). A moderate amount of free peritoneal fluid was noted. CT scan confirmed the absence of portal vein thrombosis.
The patient was discharged three weeks following admission on propranolol 40 mg twice daily, azathioprine 50 mg twice daily, spironolactone 100 mg once daily, prednisolone 7.5 mg once daily, lansoprazole, vitamin D and calcium. He had two further endoscopies, one and five weeks following discharge and his varices were successfully treated with banding. One month following discharge he had a liver biopsy. There was no evidence of any excess inflammation and no features to suggest cirrhosis or drug-induced liver disease. Overall this was essentially normal liver tissue.
Taking into account the liver histology and the absence of evidence of portal vein thrombosis on imaging we concluded that the patient had IPH. We decided not to proceed to portal pressure measurement because this would not contribute to the management of the patient.
Two months following discharge the patient was reviewed and was well. He had not had any further episodes of haematemesis or melaena.

Three days earlier he had been hit in the right eye with a cricket ball. There were no other ocular complaints or significant past ocular history. The patient was in excellent general health and was not taking any medications.
On examination, his corrected visual acuities were 6/12 and 6/6 in the right and left eye respectively. Intraocular pressures were 19 mm Hg in each eye. Biomicroscopy revealed a moderate traumatic iritis in the right eye. After pupillary dilatation, ocular examination revealed a clear lens with an annular pigment band on the posterior capsule in the right eye. No other signs of blunt trauma were detected on a detailed examination of the anterior and posterior segments. The examination of left eye was within normal limits. There was no evidence of any pigmentation on the posterior capsule in the left eye. The patient was treated with mild steroids (prednisolone acetate 0.5% q.i.d) and cycloplegics (cyclopentolate 1%) for a week.
During follow-up evaluation of the patient after two weeks, visual acuities were 6/6 in both eyes. The traumatic iritis in the right eye had resolved. On a detailed evaluation of the right eye, no sequelae of blunt trauma were found. However, the annular pigment band on the posterior capsule of right eye persisted.

Exposure associated respiratory symptoms increased continuously during a period of 12 years. Allergic bronchial asthma, caused by sensitization against cow dust-derived allergens, was diagnosed by a positive skin prick test (Bencard®) and by the detection of IgE antibodies against Bos d 2 at 74.9 kIU/l (Pharmacia, UniCAP®). Moreover, nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness was verified by a positive histamine inhalation challenge test. The diagnosis of occupational asthma was confirmed by a separate specific inhalation challenge test using a 10% extract of cow hair allergens which led to a 330% increase of airway resistance (Raw).
The German Professionals insurance laws require complete elimination of allergen exposures for the compensation of occupational allergic asthma as occupational disease []. Legal consequence would usually be to abandon dairy farming. However, in our case presented, dairy farming substantially contributed to family-income and the compensation offered would be insufficient for subsistence. Hyposensitization is the most effective measure in the prevention of allergic symptoms in patients with asthma. In that farmer the hyposensitization was not feasible due to permanent exposure to allergens. This farmer did not wear a helmet during the milking process because of claustrophobic panic attacks (fear of suffocation). Moreover an immunotherapy with recombinant lipocalins is currently not available.
Respirator helmets have been predominantly used as effective measures for prevention of the inhalation of fumes and dusts []. Investigations about the effectiveness of respirator helmets against high-molecular allergens to prevent allergic asthma are rare. Taivainen et al. (1998) demonstrated that due to the use of a dust respirator helmet with a P2-class filter, dairy farmers with occupational asthma induced by cow dander showed less rhinitic symptoms and an improved peak flow rate []. However, workers using respirator helmets were not prevented against a progressive behavior of occupational asthma [,]. Thus it is to doubt whether respirator helmets are efficient in farmers with occupational asthma to provide a complete protection against allergens [].
To enable further dairy farming, the farmer installed a milking robot in 1999, i.e., an automatic milking system (AMS). At present circa 1300 AMS are installed, predominantly in the Netherlands, followed by Germany. AMS were developed in the course of increasing automation of the agricultural production. AMS consist of a milking box with the milking equipment and an electronic controlling system, an automatically operating dosing unit of a specific food-concentrate as well as a software controlled management system. The cows are decoyed from a specific food-concentrate to enter the milking box. A transponder, fixed on the cow neck, initiates milking operations automatically controlled by software and laser. The milking robot operates in the cowshed, which is air-shielded from the control-centre. After the installation of AMS the farmer was involved only in terms of monitoring the milking process. Figure shows the job and the current exposure situation of the farmer. It is apparent that the novel milking technique reduced exposure significantly by some 90% (from over 2 hours to approx. 10 min.) without a decline of milk production. Beyond allergen exposure reduction, the physical workload was lessened and the time available for activities to improve coping was increased – these factors are increasingly recognized as relevant for the prognosis of asthma []. Table shows the influence of the AMS technique on the current occupational exposure of the farmer. According to German Professionals insurance laws all conceivable measures must be taken into account even AMS is an expensive technical device to prevent occupational asthma.
After installation of the milking robot the farmer reported significantly less frequent allergic and asthmatic symptoms. Asthma medication was reduced and required only once daily in the evening. Improvement was noted also in terms of lung-function and decreased total serum IgE: serum IgE decreased from 1332 IU/ml before milking robot installation to 572 and 474 IU/ml two and three years after installation, respectively. FEV1 improved by 20% and vital capacity by 11%, comparing values one year before with two years after installation. A CAP-RAST score ""5"" versus Bos d 2 was determined after the intervention. Preceding EAST-Test results vs. Bos d 2 were not suitable for comparison.
Current discussions address threshold limit values for allergens that may prevent allergic symptoms []. These have been proposed also for the cow dust-derived allergen Bos d 2 []. Table shows examples for successful measures of exposure minimization at workplaces to reduce sensitizations. Recent studies have already demonstrated that allergen exposure reduction at workplaces is successful in reducing sensitizations, e.g., to latex proteins [,], laboratory animals [] or acid anhydrides [].","[[37.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['respiratory', 'bronchial', 'skin', 'bronchial', 'airway', 'lung']","['asthmatic complaints', 'respiratory symptoms', 'Allergic bronchial asthma', 'sensitization against cow dust-derived allergens', 'bronchial hyperresponsiveness', 'occupational asthma', 'airway resistance', 'occupational allergic asthma', 'occupational disease', 'allergic symptoms', 'asthma', 'exposure to allergens', 'claustrophobic panic attacks', 'fear of suffocation', 'allergic asthma', 'occupational asthma', 'rhinitic symptoms', 'improved peak flow rate', 'occupational asthma', 'occupational asthma', 'decline of milk production', 'asthma', 'occupational exposure', 'occupational asthma', 'allergic and asthmatic symptoms', 'Improvement', 'decreased total serum IgE', 'allergic symptoms', 'cow dust-derived allergen']",[],"['37', 'farmer', '1998', '1999', 'Germany', 'software controlled management system']","['skin prick test', 'IgE antibodies against Bos d 2', 'histamine inhalation challenge test', 'specific inhalation challenge test', 'complete elimination of allergen exposures', 'Hyposensitization', 'hyposensitization', 'wear a helmet', 'immunotherapy', 'recombinant lipocalins', 'Respirator helmets', 'respirator helmets', 'dust respirator helmet', 'peak flow rate', 'respirator helmets', 'respirator helmets', 'milking robot', 'automatic milking system', 'AMS', 'AMS', 'allergen exposure reduction', 'physical workload was lessened', 'activities to improve coping was increased', 'AMS technique', 'AMS', 'Asthma medication', 'lung-function', 'total serum IgE', 'serum IgE', 'FEV1', 'vital capacity', 'CAP-RAST score', 'Bos d 2', 'EAST-Test', 'Bos d 2', 'measures of exposure minimization at workplaces to reduce sensitizations', 'studies', 'allergen exposure reduction', 'allergen exposure reduction at workplaces', 'acid anhydrides']","['12 years', '1999', 'At present', 'current']"
157,1173139-1,15929799,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1173139.xml,Long-term survival after an aggressive surgical resection and chemotherapy for stage IV pulmonary giant cell carcinoma,"A 51-year-old male was admitted in June 2001, due to hemosputum, cough, hemo-stool and an abnormal shadow on a chest roentgenogram. Laboratory results showed severe anemia with hemoglobin of 4.0 g/dl (13.6 < normal range < 16.8 g/dl) and hematocrit of 16.0 % (40 < normal range < 48 %). The patient's chest X-ray demonstrated a huge mass lesion in the left upper lung field (Figure ). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a mass shadow, measuring 7.0 × 7.0 cm in size in the left upper lobe (S1+2) without any invasion of the surrounding tissue such as the vessels, plexus or thoracic wall and with no mediastinal lymph node swelling. Abdominal CT revealed a huge mass, measuring 12.7 × 7.5 cm in size in the small intestine. Prior to performing any treatment for the presumed lung cancer, we tried to stop the continuous bleeding from tumor in the small intestine. As a result, we performed an emergency operation. The tumor was observed in the jejunum at a location about 30 cm from the ligament of Treitz on the anal side and a 25 cm length of the jejunum, including the tumor, was thus resected. Six days later, the patient experienced sudden chest pain, dyspnoea and hemoptysis. The patient's chest X ray showed the left lung mass shadow to have rapidly increased in size, while the broncho-fiberscopy findings showed bleeding from the left upper bronchus and an obstruction of the left lower bronchus due to coagulation. Hemothorax due to a rupture of the lung induced by the rapid growth of the tumor was found after an emergency thoracotmy. The tumor was so large that it was difficult to approach the interlobular pulmonary artery. Therefore, a left pneumonectomy with mediastinal lymph nodal dissection was performed. Thereafter, intraoperative intrapleural hypotonic cisplatin treatment [] was performed because some tumor cells were suspected to exist in the pleural cavity due to the rupture of the tumor. A histological examination revealed pure giant cell carcinoma containing no sarcomatoid component, similar to that found in the small intestine (Figure ). As a result, we diagnosed the patient to have stage IV disease (pathological stage T2N0M1) according to the TNM classification []. The patient had an uneventful recovery without any complications. However, about 4 months after the first operation, the patient was diagnosed to have a recurrence at another site in the small intestine and spleen by abdominal CT. The patient received 2 cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin 40 mg/m2 + gemcitabine 800 mg/m2+ vinorelbine 20 mg/m2), at days 1 and 8, and thereafter every 4 weeks). The splenic metastases increased in size while the size of the tumor in the small intestine decreased. At this time, no recurrence site except for those in the small intestine and spleen were found, therefore, to avoid the risk of bleeding either from tumors in the small intestine or a rupture of spleen in the future, surgical treatment consisting of a partial resection of the small intestine and a splenectomy was performed. The intestinal tumor was found in the jejunum at a location about 10 cm from the ligament of Treitz on the anal side and a total 20 cm length of the jejunum, including the tumor, was resected. A pathological examination revealed a proliferation of pure giant cell carcinoma with extensive necrosis both in the small intestine and the spleen, thus suggesting the chemotherapy to be effective in the both organs. Thereafter, the patient received 2 additional cycles of this triplet chemotherapy. The patient experienced neither any hematological nor severe non-hematological adverse events. About 6 months later, metastases in multiple abdominal lymph nodes were found (Figure ). The patient was started on chemotherapy (carboplatin AUC = 2 + paclitaxel 60 mg/m2, on days 1 and 8, and thereafter every 3 weeks). After receiving a total of 10 cycles of chemotherapy on an outpatient basis, abdominal CT showed the chemotherapeutic effect to be a complete response (Figure ), without any severe hematological or non-hematological adverse events. At present, the patient has survived for about 3-years since the first operation and a complete response has been maintained for 15 months.","[[51.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['chest', 'chest', 'left upper lung field', 'chest', 'left upper lobe', 'surrounding tissue', 'vessels', 'plexus', 'thoracic wall', 'mediastinal lymph node', 'Abdominal', 'small intestine', 'lung', 'small intestine', 'jejunum', '30 cm from the ligament of Treitz on the anal side', '25 cm length of the jejunum', 'chest', 'chest', 'left lung', 'left upper bronchus', 'left lower bronchus', 'lung', 'interlobular pulmonary artery', 'mediastinal lymph nodal', 'intrapleural', 'pleural cavity', 'small intestine', 'small intestine', 'spleen', 'abdominal', 'splenic', 'small intestine', 'small intestine', 'spleen', 'small intestine', 'spleen', 'small intestine', 'intestinal', 'jejunum', '10 cm from the ligament of Treitz on the anal side', 'jejunum', 'small intestine', 'spleen', 'both organs', 'abdominal lymph nodes', 'abdominal']","['hemosputum', 'cough', 'hemo-stool', 'abnormal shadow', 'anemia', 'mass lesion', 'mass shadow', 'invasion of the surrounding tissue', 'mediastinal lymph node swelling', 'mass', 'lung cancer', 'bleeding', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'chest pain', 'dyspnoea', 'hemoptysis', 'left lung mass shadow', 'bleeding', 'obstruction', 'obstruction of the left lower bronchus', 'coagulation', 'Hemothorax', 'rupture of the lung', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'tumor cells', 'rupture of the tumor', 'giant cell carcinoma', 'sarcomatoid component', 'disease', 'complications', 'splenic metastases', 'tumor', 'recurrence site', 'bleeding', 'tumors', 'rupture of spleen', 'intestinal tumor', 'tumor', 'pure giant cell carcinoma', 'giant cell carcinoma', 'necrosis', 'non-hematological adverse events', 'metastases', 'chemotherapeutic effect to be a complete response', 'hematological or non-hematological adverse events', 'complete response has been maintained']","['cisplatin', 'gemcitabine', 'vinorelbine', 'carboplatin', 'paclitaxel']","['51', 'June 2001']","['chest roentgenogram', 'Laboratory', 'hemoglobin', 'hematocrit', 'chest X-ray', 'Computed tomography (CT) of the chest', 'Abdominal CT', 'treatment', 'emergency operation', 'resected', 'chest X ray', 'broncho-fiberscopy', 'emergency thoracotmy', 'left pneumonectomy', 'mediastinal lymph nodal dissection', 'intrapleural hypotonic cisplatin treatment', 'histological examination', 'operation', 'abdominal CT.', 'chemotherapy', 'surgical treatment', 'partial resection of the small intestine', 'splenectomy', 'total 20 cm length of the jejunum, including the tumor, was resected', 'pathological examination', 'chemotherapy', 'triplet chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'abdominal CT']","['Six days later', 'Six days later', 'Six days later', '4 months', 'At this time', 'About 6 months later', '15 months']"
158,1174869-1,15921523,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1174869.xml,Embolic stroke complicating Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis circumstantially linked to rectal trauma from foreign body: a first case report,"A 58-year-old male was brought to the emergency room with confusion and an inability to speak for 1 day. He had a past history of hypertension and hypomania. He was single and he lived alone. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 80/63 mm of Hg, heart rate 126/minute, and temperature 102°F. He was awake but unable to speak due to a mixed receptive and expressive aphasia. He had right homonymous hemianopsia and hemiplegia. Cardiac examination was positive for a pansystolic murmur in the apical area. The abdominal examination was unremarkable. On rectal examination there was perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone. Complete blood count showed WBC 15,400/mm3 with a left shift, hematocrit 49%, and normal platelets. Serum chemistries showed glucose 84 mg/dl, albumin 2.9 mg/dl, and calcium 8.5 mg/dl. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain, including diffusion weighted imaging, revealed acute hemorrhagic infarction of the left occipital lobe and acute embolic infarctions of the left frontal and right occipital lobes (Fig and ). Transesophageal Echocardiogram demonstrated mitral regurgitation and large vegetations on the posterior leaf of the mitral valve. Splenic and renal infarcts were visible on Computerized Tomography of the abdomen. All of the blood culture bottles and the urine culture grew methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment of the bacterial endocarditis was started with intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin. The patient had a significant recovery of speech and motor function within a few days. When asked about recent dental work, he gave a history of a tooth extraction 2–3 days before the hospitalization but was unable to provide information about his dentist. A dentist from the hospital examined the patient and found no clinical evidence of the extraction. The patient underwent a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation. He displayed confabulation and perseverance (marriage, retirement, hospitalization were reported using the same date which was his birthday). He also had significant executive dysfunction including concrete thinking and poor insight regarding his health and cognitive problems. On hospital day 12 the patient had mitral valve replacement surgery using a bioprosthetic valve. He completed a six-week course of intravenous antibiotic treatment. He also underwent extensive rehabilitation therapy and was sent home after 8 weeks of hospitalization. On subsequent follow-up visits the patient showed complete recovery from the stroke and was back to his baseline. In response to questions about his sexual history the patient indicated having heterosexual relations with multiple partners. However, his answers were inconsistent and seemed unreliable.
A closer examination of his medical records revealed that two years prior to this hospitalization, the patient was admitted with a plastic soda bottle retained in the rectosigmoid for 3 days. The bottle had been filled with warm water and inserted into his anal canal for sexual stimulation. It slipped all the way into the rectum and could not be retrieved. His attempts to extract it at home were unsuccessful. In the emergency room his physical examination was normal except for a palpable mass in the suprapubic area, decreased anal sphincter tone and a dilated rectal vault. On X-ray of the abdomen, the outline of a plastic bottle was visible in the rectosigmoid (Fig ). The patient was taken to the operating room and under spinal anesthesia the bottle was extracted. He had multiple lacerations of the rectal mucosa but there was no perforation. He went home the next day. On follow-up visits to primary care he was noted to be overall healthy except having mild hypertension. His behavior was indicative of hypomania, but he did not get a formal psychiatric evaluation.
Foreign bodies in the rectum and methods of their extraction have been amply chronicled in the surgical literature []. Sexual stimulation is the reason in a majority of these cases []. Local trauma, perforation, and resultant peritonitis are well known complications []. An unlimited PUBMED search for articles on bacteremia or endocarditis related to rectal foreign body insertion was unfruitful (We tried MeSH terms anal/rectal/colorectal/foreign bodies/anorectal /sexual deviation for the purpose). Bacteremia and septicemia from barium enema [], and therapeutic anal dilatation [] have been published. Procedures like fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy are known to cause endocarditis [], but septic stroke resulting from endocarditis related to lower gastrointestinal instrumentation has also not been reported.
The patient's history of anorectal insertion of a plastic soda bottle for sexual gratification is consistent with published reports of use of large objects for this purpose []. The resultant rectal trauma can easily lead to bacteremia. Rectal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is well documented and is a potential source of infection []. This organism tends to be more abundant on the rectal mucosa than within the feces []. In a study of gastrointestinal colonization, Staphylococcus aureus grew from the culture of rectal swabs in 60% cases versus 53% positive culture of nasal swabs taken from the same subjects []. This organism is known to cause endocarditis of normal heart valves [,]. Neurologic complications of infective endocarditis, particularly embolic events, tend to be higher in cases of endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus [].
It is known that few patients with rectal foreign bodies will freely admit to transanal introduction []. This explains to some extent the paucity of literature linking this practice with bacteremia or endocarditis. We believe our patient was habituated to rectal insertion of foreign bodies and that is evident from his previous history along with the clinical findings of perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone []. In the absence of a reliable history from the patient, the link between endocarditis and rectal trauma in this case is based on circumstantial evidence. A further study of patients with well-documented evidence of rectal foreign body insertion could be the next step to explore this important observation.","[[58.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['heart', 'Cardiac', 'apical area', 'abdominal', 'rectal', 'perianal', 'sphincter', 'brain', 'left occipital lobe', 'left frontal and right occipital lobes', 'Transesophageal', 'mitral', 'posterior leaf of the mitral valve', 'Splenic', 'renal', 'abdomen', 'dental', 'tooth', 'rectosigmoid', 'anal canal', 'rectum', 'suprapubic area', 'anal sphincter', 'rectal vault', 'abdomen', 'rectosigmoid', 'spinal', 'rectal mucosa', 'rectum', 'rectal', 'anal', 'rectal', 'colorectal', 'foreign bodies', 'anorectal', 'sexual deviation', 'anal', 'lower gastrointestinal', 'anorectal', 'rectal', 'Rectal', 'rectal mucosa', 'rectal mucosa than within the feces', 'feces', 'gastrointestinal', 'rectal', 'nasal', 'heart valves', 'Neurologic', 'rectal', 'rectal', 'perianal', 'sphincter', 'rectal', 'rectal']","['confusion', 'inability to speak', 'hypertension', 'hypomania', 'awake', 'unable to speak', 'aphasia', 'right homonymous hemianopsia', 'hemiplegia', 'pansystolic murmur', 'unremarkable', 'perianal erythema', 'diminished sphincter tone', 'left shift', 'hemorrhagic infarction of the left occipital lobe', 'embolic infarctions', 'embolic infarctions of the left frontal and right occipital lobes', 'mitral regurgitation', 'vegetations', 'infarcts', 'methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus', 'bacterial endocarditis', 'recovery of speech and motor function', 'extraction', 'confabulation', 'perseverance', 'executive dysfunction', 'concrete thinking', 'poor insight', 'cognitive problems', 'complete recovery', 'stroke', 'back to his baseline', 'answers were inconsistent and seemed unreliable', 'plastic soda bottle retained', 'mass', 'decreased anal sphincter', 'decreased anal sphincter tone', 'dilated rectal vault', 'outline of a plastic bottle', 'lacerations of the rectal mucosa', 'perforation', 'overall healthy', 'hypertension', 'behavior was indicative of hypomania', 'hypomania', 'Foreign bodies', 'Sexual stimulation', 'Local trauma', 'perforation', 'peritonitis', 'bacteremia', 'endocarditis', 'rectal foreign body insertion', 'Bacteremia', 'septicemia', 'endocarditis', 'septic', 'septic stroke', 'endocarditis', 'lower gastrointestinal instrumentation', 'rectal trauma', 'bacteremia', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'infection', 'organism', 'gastrointestinal colonization', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'endocarditis of normal heart valves', 'infective endocarditis', 'embolic events', 'endocarditis', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'rectal foreign bodies', 'bacteremia', 'endocarditis', 'rectal insertion of foreign bodies', 'perianal erythema', 'diminished sphincter tone', 'endocarditis', 'rectal trauma', 'rectal foreign body insertion']","['nafcillin', 'gentamicin']","['58', 'emergency room', 'dentist', 'emergency room', 'operating room']","['physical examination', 'blood pressure', 'heart rate', 'temperature', 'Complete blood count', 'WBC', 'hematocrit', 'platelets', 'Serum chemistries', 'glucose', 'albumin', 'calcium', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain', 'Transesophageal Echocardiogram', 'Computerized Tomography of the abdomen', 'blood culture', 'blood culture bottles', 'urine culture', 'Treatment', 'dental work', 'dental work', 'tooth extraction', 'neuropsychiatric evaluation', 'mitral valve replacement surgery using a bioprosthetic valve', 'antibiotic treatment', 'extensive rehabilitation therapy', 'bottle had been filled with warm water and inserted into his anal canal for sexual stimulation', 'physical examination', 'X-ray of the abdomen', 'spinal anesthesia', 'bottle was extracted', 'formal psychiatric evaluation', 'barium enema', 'therapeutic anal dilatation', 'fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'anorectal insertion of a plastic soda bottle for sexual gratification', 'culture of rectal swabs', 'culture of nasal swabs', 'swabs', 'transanal introduction', 'study']","['1 day', '1 day', 'within a few days', 'recent', '2–3 days', 'hospital day 12', 'two years', 'prior to this hospitalization', '3 days']"

She had been unsuccessfully treated over a time period of 7 years with three different disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug regimens including methotrexate. The patient has not yet been treated with a tumour necrosis factor alpha blocking therapy. After informed consent, she was treated with rituximab according to the same protocol as patient A. In addition, patient B continued to receive 20 mg methotrexate weekly. She did not receive any glucocorticoids during the study.
The analysis of lymphocyte subsets by immunofluorescence staining was performed by incubating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with anti-CD19 and anti-CD3 antibodies (Phycoerythrin (PE) or Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled as indicated; all antibodies from Becton-Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) using a FACSCalibur (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). Frequencies of cell populations were calculated using CellQuest software.
Disease activity was regularly determined using the disease activity score (DAS28 index) and by monitoring C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.
Genomic DNA was isolated from PBMCs using the QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Rearranged VHDJH gene rearrangements were amplified for all VH families using a nested PCR approach []. Genomic DNA was amplified in separate reactions for the six VH families (VH1 oligonucleotide primers also co-amplify perfectly VH7 gene rearrangements). The final concentrations of the reagents were 200 μM each dNTP (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany), 0.625 μM each primer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 × PCR buffer II and 2.5 U AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
During the external amplification round, 250 ng (5 μl) DNA were amplified in a 75 μl reaction containing primers specific for the leader peptide sequence and a mixture of external JH primers in a Gene Amp PCR System 2400 (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The internal amplification round was conducted with the 5' primer specific for framework region FR1 and a mixture of internal JH primers using 5 μl of the product of the first amplification reaction as template. The cycling parameters have been described previously []. Briefly, the annealing temperatures were 50°C for the external amplification round and 65°C for the internal round.
The polymerase error rate for the amplification of VH genes using nested PCR has been documented to be 1 × 10-4 mutations/bp [].
Total cellular RNA was extracted from 1 × 107 PBMCs after lysis of the cells in 1.5 ml TRIZOL reagent (Gibco, Karlsruhe, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions.
The RT-PCR reaction was performed using Titan One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). First-strand cDNA was synthesised at 42°C for 60 min in a 50 μl reaction mix containing 5 mM dithiothreitol, 400 ng oligo-dT15, 200 μM dNTP, 8 U RNAse inhibitor, 5 × RT-PCR buffer, 20 U high-fidelity enzyme mix RT-AMV and 1 μg RNA. VH mRNA transcripts were amplified by the nested PCR protocol described earlier using 5 μl cDNA and C-region primers (Cμ, TCA GGA CTG ATG GGA AGC CC; Cγ, CGA GCC GCT GGT CAG AGC G; Cα, ACC CTC AGC GGG AAG ACC TT) as the 3' primers in the first round.
All PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 1.5% agarose and were visualised with ethidium bromide. Successful amplifications were identified as a band corresponding to a product of approximately 350 bp. The bands were excised and subsequently purified using the MinElute Gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR products were polished using the PCR polishing kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam Zuidoost, The Netherlands), were ligated with Zero Blunt pCR-blunt vector and were transformed into One Shot® TOP10 cells (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany)
Plasmid DNA from clones containing gene inserts was prepared using the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System kit (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The DNA sequences were determined using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems) and the M13 forward and reverse universal primers in an automated genetic analyser ABI PRISM 310 (Applied Biosystems). Germline immunoglobulin V genes were identified by blast searching the VBase Sequence Directory [].
The procedure for single cell sorting and subsequent PCR amplifications has been described previously []. Briefly, single CD19+CD27- and CD19+CD27+ cells were sorted into wells of 96-well plates using a FACStar Plus flow cytometer with an automated single cell deposit unit (Beckton-Dickinson, USA). After primer extension pre-amplification, the rearranged VHDJH genes were amplified by nested PCRs using the same oligonucleotides as those already described. After gel purification (Qiagen), the PCR products were directly sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems) and the 5' V primer used for the internal amplification.
The statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad software . Sequences were analysed by the Fisher's exact test to compare the differences in the distribution of particular gene segments. The average lengths of CDR3 were studied by the unpaired t test. The chi-square test was used to compare the mutational frequencies.
Figure shows the clinical response of RA patient A during the two treatment periods with rituximab. B cells accounted for 10.1% of peripheral lymphocytes at the beginning of the study. A rapid B-cell depletion occurred after each therapy, and lasted up to 7 months and 10 months, respectively. The time points of 7 months and 27 months were the first times where B cells were detectable in peripheral blood, either by flow cytometry or by PCR (data not shown). The B-cell frequency was 3% of total lymphocytes at 7 months and was 2.4% of total lymphocytes at 27 months (Fig. ). Patient A had an active disease before therapy, as indicated by a high CRP level and a high DAS28 clinical activity index. The disease activity declined continuously after rituximab therapy. The patient had a good clinical response starting from 3 months and lasting over 1 year. We observed a deterioration of the clinical parameters about 13 months after the first therapy. The patient therefore received a second treatment with rituximab at 17 months. Again, patient A presented a clinical improvement following B-cell depletion. The arrows in Fig. indicate the four time points when the B-cell repertoire was studied. Table presents the RF values. The RF activity declined quite rapidly after rituximab therapy and followed the inflammatory activity, with increasing values in relapse and falling values after the second treatment.","[[63.0, 'year']]",F,2005,[],"['rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive RA.', 'Successful amplifications', 'RA', 'peripheral lymphocytes', 'rapid B-cell depletion', 'B cells were detectable in peripheral blood', 'disease', 'disease activity declined', 'good clinical response', 'deterioration of the clinical parameters', 'clinical improvement', 'B-cell depletion', 'RF activity declined', 'inflammatory activity']","['methotrexate', 'rituximab', 'methotrexate', 'dNTP', 'primer', 'MgCl2', 'PCR buffer II', 'AmpliTaq DNA polymerase', 'DNA', 'dithiothreitol', 'oligo-dT15', 'dNTP', 'RNAse inhibitor', 'RT-PCR buffer', 'agarose', 'ethidium bromide', 'Invitrogen', 'Plasmid DNA', 'rituximab', 'rituximab', 'rituximab', 'rituximab']","['B', '63', 'Becton-Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany', 'Becton-Dickinson', 'San Jose', 'Hilden', 'Germany', 'Germany', 'Perkin Elmer', 'Karlsruhe', 'Germany', 'Roche, Mannheim, Germany).

Arterial blood gases showed a severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.09, arterial O2 tension 24 kPa, arterial CO2 tension 4.3 kPa, HCO3 10.3 mmol/l, base excess -19 and lactate 13 mmol/l). She was therefore commenced on continuous venovenous haemodialysis with lactate-free dialysate and infusion of 50 ml/hour sodium bicarbonate for management of her metabolic acidosis. Computed tomography scanning showed no intracranial abnormalities to explain her reduced GCS. She was transferred to the intensive care unit, and the National Poisons Information Service (London) was contacted for further advice on management.
A brown watery fluid (30 ml), similar to commercially available rotenone in smell and consistency, was noticed via nasogastric aspiration 6 hours after ingestion. Because previous in vitro studies have demonstrated a benefit of NAC and antioxidants in preventing rotenone toxicity in human cell lines [-], she was treated with intravenous NAC (standard Prescott protocol 1979) and other antioxidants (including multivitamins, 5 ml/day ketovite [orally] and 125 mg zinc sulphate three times daily [orally]) empirically. Also, 200 mg/day iron was administered intravenously; this has been shown to activate ATP-dependent potassium channels, which is protective in rotenone-induced toxicity [].
She remained hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, and her cardiac index on oesophageal Doppler studies was 7.7 l/min per m2 with a stroke volume of 97 ml and systemic vascular resistance index of 470, indicating the presence of a vasodilated high output state. She was therefore commenced on a noradrenaline (norepinephrine) infusion in order to maintain her blood pressure, with a maximum dose 0.35 μg/kg per hour. Repeat cardiac studies using pulse contour cardiac output 12 hours after the initial presentation revealed a worsening cardiac index (2.5 l/min per m2), with a reduced stroke volume of 30 ml and an increased systemic vascular resistance index of 2359, indicating the presence of a vasoconstricted low output state. She was therefore started on dobutamine (maximum dose 10 μg/kg per h) and weaned from the noradrenaline infusion.
After initial stabilization of her clinical state with maximal supportive care, she then started to deteriorate clinically, with signs of cardiovascular collapse and no signs of obvious neurological recovery. At 48 hours after admission she suffered an asystolic cardiac arrest, which did not respond to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. At postmortem there were signs of multiorgan failure, with pulmonary oedema and congestion of the heart, spleen and kidneys. The liver was icteric with centrilobular necrosis and general disintegration.","[[47.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['heart', 'renal', 'liver', 'Arterial', 'arterial', 'arterial', 'intracranial', 'cardiac', 'oesophageal', 'cardiac', 'cardiac', 'cardiac', 'systemic vascular', 'cardiovascular', 'cardiac', 'cardiopulmonary', 'multiorgan', 'pulmonary', 'heart', 'spleen', 'kidneys', 'liver', 'centrilobular']","['diabetes mellitus', 'ingested up to 200 ml from a bottle of 0.8% rotenone solution', 'collapsed', 'unconscious', 'vomiting', 'sinus rhythm', 'normal renal function', 'liver dysfunction', 'metabolic acidosis', 'metabolic acidosis', 'intracranial abnormalities', 'reduced GCS', 'watery fluid', 'fluid', 'ingestion', 'activate ATP-dependent potassium channels', 'rotenone-induced toxicity', 'hypotensive', 'vasodilated high output state', 'maintain her blood pressure', 'worsening cardiac index', 'vasoconstricted low output state', 'deteriorate clinically', 'cardiovascular collapse', 'neurological recovery', 'asystolic cardiac arrest', 'multiorgan failure', 'pulmonary oedema', 'congestion', 'icteric', 'centrilobular necrosis', 'general disintegration']","['metformin', 'rotenone', 'sodium bicarbonate', 'rotenone', 'NAC', 'rotenone', 'NAC', 'multivitamins', 'ketovite', 'zinc sulphate', 'iron', 'noradrenaline', 'norepinephrine', 'dobutamine', 'noradrenaline']","['47', 'emergency department', '3/15', 'intensive care unit', 'London', '1979']","['weighing', 'Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score', 'intubated', 'ventilated', 'sedative', 'paralyzing agents', 'intubation', 'blood pressure', 'heart rate', 'electrocardiogram', 'Baseline blood', 'alanine transaminase', 'Arterial blood gases', 'pH', 'arterial O2 tension', 'arterial CO2 tension', 'HCO3', 'base excess', 'lactate', 'venovenous haemodialysis', 'lactate-free dialysate', 'Computed tomography scanning', 'GCS', 'nasogastric aspiration', 'vitro studies', 'antioxidants', 'antioxidants', 'fluid resuscitation', 'cardiac index', 'oesophageal Doppler studies', 'stroke volume', 'systemic vascular resistance index', 'cardiac studies', 'pulse contour cardiac output', 'cardiac index', 'reduced stroke volume', 'stroke volume', 'increased systemic vascular resistance index', 'maximal supportive care', 'cardiopulmonary resuscitation']","['48 hours after admission', 'postmortem']"

Her past medical history included depression, hyperlipidemia, and anorexia nervosa. There was a previous history of amphetamine abuse as well as two prior episodes of polypharmacy overdose. The patient was discovered at home with a Glasgow Coma Score of 11 and was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic. Soon after transfer to hospital, the patient became unconscious (Glasgow Coma Score, 3) and was intubated. Empty bottles of paroxetine, moclobemide, pravastatin, and alprazolam were found in her house. The patient was not known to be on neuroleptic antipsychotic medications, and had not used amphetamine for at least 1 year.
The patient subsequently developed features of serotonin syndrome [,], with progressive hypotension despite a central venous pressure of 10 mmHg and commencement of norepinephrine to a maximum dose of 2.5 μg/kg/min, as well as 10 l fluid resuscitation on the first day of admission. Additional features of serotonin syndrome included fever (42°C) and generalized hypertonicity, which was complicated by severe rhabdomyolyis (peak creatine kinase level, 109,000 IU/l). Furthermore, there was evidence of coagulopathy, with severe bleeding from puncture sites and the gastrointestinal tract. Investigations confirmed the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
The patient developed profound metabolic derangement with lactic acidemia (lactate peak, 11.7 mmol/l; pH nadir, 7.14), oliguric ARF, severe hyperkalemia (K+, 9.1 mmol/l at presentation), hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, and with the subsequent development of ischemic hepatitis (alanine aminotransferase, 4048 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 92 U/l). On the first intensive care unit day, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with a conventional hemofilter was employed for the management of oliguric ARF and hyperkalemia.
Treatment with fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelet and red blood cells was required.

The past history was uncontributory except that the patient was an unvaccinated immigrant, living in close contact with her alcoholic grandfather. The patient was immediately intubated, and a grayish nonadherent membrane extending through the glottis down into the larynx was apparent during the procedure. Material from the membranes was sent for cultures and the patient was started on intravenous penicillin and specific antitoxin. Although blood gases improved initially, respirator settings had soon to be increased significantly to sustain a pO2 value above 60 mm Hg (7.9 kPa). A chest roentgenogram revealed extensive bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrations (Fig. ). Laboratory findings included white blood cells 70,110 cu mm (70*109/L) with segmented neutrophils 46%, band forms 8%, platelets 134,000 cu mm (134*109/L), CRP 177. Serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations peaked at 340 U/L and 721 U/L, respectively and serum creatinine increased to 1.4 mg/dL (124 μmol/L). On hospital day 1 she became hypotensive and remained in shock despite escalating doses of inotropic agents. Echocardiographic findings, which were consistent with acute cardiomyopathy, confirmed extremely poor left ventricular contractility (asystole; shortening fraction <5%), despite high dose continuous dobutamine (20 μg.kg-1.min-1) and epinephrine (up to 5 μg.kg-1.min-1) infusions. After having completed 36 hours of hospitalization in the PICU with multiple cardiac arrests, the child was no more responding to resuscitation efforts and died.
Autopsy findings revealed numerous diphtheritic membrane formations extended down into the larynx and further obstructing the distal tracheobronchial tree (Fig. ). Myocardium edema, congestion and mononuclear and neutrophil cell infiltration, completed the clinicopathologic picture of diphtheritic cardiomyopathy. Membrane formations and visceral hemorrhagic necrotic lesions were associated with numerous strains of corynobacterium diphtheriae (producing the typical club-shaped appearance and distributed in a typical Chinese-letter appearance on the smear) (Fig. ).

A bronchoscopy with biopsy revealed a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. A FDG-PET/CT scanning showed a disseminated praetracheal, aortoal, supraclavicular and infracarinal lymphadenopathy and a spleen metastasis (stage IV) []. The patient received six cycles of Cisplatinum-Gemcitabine chemotherapy, followed by a second line Mitomycine-Vinorelbine polychemotherapy. A re-evaluation after one year revealed liver metastases and increasing mediastinal lymphadenopathy, followed by additionally Taxotere polychemotherapy. A brain magnetic resonance imaging after a pathologically Romberg Test in December 2003 showed a left hemisphere brain metastasis.
At New Year's Day 2004, the patient presented again with a three days history of increasing abdominal pain, diffuse abdominal guarding and rebound tenderness. Laboratory evaluation was without pathological findings except a marked leukocytosis (WBC = 24,000/mm3).
Abdominal CT-scan displayed free intraperitoneal air and a perforated jejunum (Figure ). The patient was operated on with the diagnosis of perforated jejunum. At surgery, a 2 cm mass was found at the surface of a loop of the jejunum with perforation of 1 cm in diameter, furthermore left upper quadrant peritonitis with pus, stool and a fibrin coating. The affected segment of the jejunum was resected with an end-to-end anastomosis and an abdominal lavage was performed. Postoperative pathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic pulmonary carcinoma (Figure ). The surgical margins were negative for tumor.

Abdominal CT showed a fungating tumor at the gastric cardia and several lymph node enlargements at the left gastric and celiac axis. Gastric endoscopic examination revealed a huge fungating mass at the cardia, and subsequently mucosal biopsy was performed. Microscopically the biopsy specimen showed proliferations of bland looking hyperplastic foveolar epithelia with basally located small nuclei and fine nuclear chromatin in the heavy inflammatory background (Figure ). Some glands were destructed by inflammatory cell invasion and revealed mild epithelial atypia with mildly increased nuclei and loss of nuclear polarity reminiscent of reactive cellular atypia (Figure ). This biopsy specimen was diagnosed as foveolar epithelial hyperplasia. However, the clinical and endoscopic features of this patient were strongly suggestive of malignancy. The patient underwent radical total gastrectomy with Roux en Y anastomosis. The extent of lymph node dissection included first and second lymph node groups. The resected stomach revealed a huge fungating tumor (Borrmann type 1) at the cardia (Figure ). The tumor measured 7 cm in the greatest diameter. The cut surface of the tumor was whitish gelatinous and the tumor involved the whole layer of the gastric wall (Figure ). The remaining gastric mucosa is grossly unremarkable. Microscopic feature of the resected specimen was very similar to that of the biopsy specimen except an evidence of deep invasion. Microscopically the tumor was sharply demarcated from surrounding mucosa and composed of proliferations of deceptively bland glands lined by mucin-rich columnar cells with small basal nuclei (Figure ). Many glands are cystically dilated especially in deep portion and their glandular lumina were filled with abundant mucin (Figure ). Most of glands were too bland to discriminate from benign foveolar epithelial hyperplasia (Figure and ), but some glands were more complicated or branched with mild to moderate cellular atypia revealing increased nuclei with loss of polarity and prominent nucleoli (Figure ). There was no evidence of individual cell invasion into lamina propria or solid growth of tumor cells. Chronic and acute inflammatory infiltrate was heavily associated within tumor. Well formed bland glands invaded to the serosa with focal desmoplastic reaction in adjacent stroma. Vascular and perineural involvements were associated. Tumor cells metastasized to 6 out of 76 regional lymph nodes. Metastatic tumor cells within regional lymph nodes were also very bland (Figure ). The pathological tumor stage corresponded to stage IIIA (T3N1M0). Immunohistochemically the tumor cells revealed no overexpression of p53 protein but high Ki-67 labelling index suggesting high proliferative activity (Figure ). The tumor cells and intraluminal mucin were diffusely expressed MUC1 (Figure ) and MUC5AC (Figure ) suggesting gastric foveolar phenotype. MUC2 expression was only focally detected (Figure ). The patient has been underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. Abdominal CT taken after 12 months suggested peritoneal carcinomatosis, multiple metastatic foci in the lung, and multiple retroperitoneal lymph node enlargements.

Endoscopy revealed grade 1 oesophagitis with a normal stomach and duodenum. Five months later he was readmitted with anorexia, weight loss, dysphagia and anaemia. Endoscopy on this occasion revealed a large pedunculated polypoidal lesion arising from the gastro-oesophageal junction within a hiatus hernia. Pathological examination of biopsies taken from the polyp showed inflammatory changes in squamous mucosa with no evidence of malignancy. As the lesion was pedunculated it was decided to attempt endoscopic snare excision which proved unsuccessful, as the lesion was too large for the snare. At laparotomy a large polypoidal mass was found arising from the distal oesophagus. Through a gastrostomy the lesion was delivered into the abdomen, a linear stapler was applied to the base of the stalk and the lesion was excised. The patient made an uneventful recovery.
The resected specimen (figure ) measured 9 cm × 4 cm × 4 cm and consisted of soft and slimy tissue. Histology showed an intact squamous mucosa and a mass of myxoid fibroblastic tissue with plasma cells and a diffuse eosinophilic infiltrate (figure ). There was no evidence of malignancy. These appearances were consistent with inflammatory fibroid polyp of the oesophagus.

Repeated endoscopic examinations revealed recurrent duodenal ulcers. The symptoms were relieved by proton-pump inhibitors, but recurred when the medication was withdrawn. She was previously diagnosed with NF1 based on clinical features and family history. Her first-degree relatives (i.e., brother, sister, and second son) were also affected by fully developed features of NF1. She had no cognitive dysfunction or learning disabilities, and showed normal intellectual development. A physical examination revealed several café-au-lait spots and multiple small nodules on the anterior chest and areolar area, and also multiple axillary freckles. A skin-nodule biopsy demonstrated characteristic neurofibromas.
On admission, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed multiple shallow ulcers in the descending duodenum. The rapid urease test and urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori were both negative. The serum fasting gastrin level was >1,000 pg/mL and 837 pg/mL in two consecutive measurements. A secretin stimulation test was not performed due to the unavailability of secretin. As a diagnosis of gastrinoma was strongly suggested, radiologic evaluations were performed to locate the lesion. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed a 3 × 2-cm, clearly defined, well-enhanced mass adjacent to the duodenal loop in the subhepatic space (Figure ). No metastatic lesions were observed in the liver or regional lymph nodes.
The association with MEN1 status was evaluated by hormonal and radiologic investigations of the parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, and adrenal gland, which proved to be negative. As a definitive treatment, an intraabdominal mass of about 2.5 × 2 cm with a thick fibrous capsular outer layer was surgically isolated and completely resected from the right lateral border of the descending duodenum. Gastrinoma was finally diagnosed by immunohistochemical staining (Figures , ). An incidental finding during the operation was numerous, small (<1.0 cm), whitish nodular masses on the serosal surface of the small bowel, many of which were enucleated. The pathologic diagnosis was gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) with a low mitotic index as evidenced by C-kit positivity (Figures , ).

He was asymptomatic. His BP was well controlled at 115/83 mmHg. He was morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 46, chronic kidney disease stage 4 (MDRD GFR of 16 ml/min), non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease status post stent placement and hyperlipidemia. His medications included nifedipine, fosinopril, atenolol, rosiglitazone, furosemide, simvastatin, aspirin, glyburide and calcium carbonate. Laboratory results: Serum creatinine 4.3 mg/dl, BUN 54 mg/dl, normal electrolytes, serum calcium 8.8 mg/dl, serum phosphorus 4.9 mg/dl, random urine protein 292 mg/dl, random urine creatinine 49 mg/dl, urine protein/creatinine ratio of 5.9, hemoglobin A1c 7% and hemoglobin 13.9 g/dl. Patient was educated about the course and prognosis of his kidney disease and advised diet and exercise for weight loss. He was referred for arterial-venous fistula placement for providing renal replacement therapy in future. Over the next 6 months the patient failed all conservative methods of weight loss including the use of orlistat. His morbid obesity posed a major contraindication for enrolling him for kidney transplantation. He agreed to the surgical therapy option for treating his obesity. He was referred for bariatric surgery in June 2003.
After the bariatric surgery in September 2003, he had lost 60 pounds at 6 months (BMI 37). He was able to discontinue all his oral hypoglycemic agents maintaining a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2% and required only one anti-hypertensive medication to achieve the recommended target blood pressure reading. His BUN and creatinine has remained at 22 mg/dl and 4.6 mg/dl respectively. The patient is being followed at regular intervals and over the course of the next eight months has lost an additional 30 pounds (BMI 32), a total weight loss of 90 pounds since the bariatric surgery. His serum creatinine has remained stable at 4 mg/dl, BUN 37 mg/dl, random urinary protein 99 mg/dl, random urinary creatinine 121 mg/dl, urine protein/creatinine ratio of 0.8 and hemoglobin A1c 5.1%. The inverse creatinine to time plot as shown in figure clearly demonstrates the stabilization of the renal function 15 months following his weight loss surgery. The patient was being evaluated for pre-emptive renal transplantation and because of his previous history of coronary artery disease he underwent a left heart catheterization study in March 2005. Unfortunately, despite all precautions he developed radio-contrast induced nephropathy and had to be initiated on renal replacement therapy. He currently remains on dialysis and is awaiting a renal transplantation, which would not have been possible without his weight loss.","[[43.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['kidney', 'body', 'kidney', 'coronary artery', 'kidney', 'arterial-venous', 'renal', 'kidney', 'renal', 'renal', 'coronary artery', 'left heart', 'renal', 'renal']","['chronic kidney disease', 'asymptomatic', 'morbidly obese', 'chronic kidney disease', 'MDRD', 'non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus', 'hypertension', 'coronary artery disease', 'hyperlipidemia', 'kidney disease', 'morbid obesity', 'obesity', 'lost 60 pounds', 'lost an additional 30 pounds', 'stabilization of the renal function', 'coronary artery disease', 'radio-contrast induced nephropathy', 'weight loss']","['nifedipine', 'fosinopril', 'atenolol', 'rosiglitazone', 'furosemide', 'simvastatin', 'aspirin', 'glyburide', 'calcium carbonate', 'orlistat']","['43', 'nephrology clinic', 'Overton Brooks VAMC', 'November of 2002', 'June 2003', 'September 2003', 'March 2005']","['BP', 'body mass index', 'BMI', 'MDRD GFR', 'stent placement', 'medications', 'Laboratory', 'Serum creatinine', 'BUN', 'electrolytes', 'serum calcium', 'serum phosphorus', 'random urine protein', 'random urine creatinine', 'urine protein/creatinine ratio', 'hemoglobin A1c', 'hemoglobin', 'diet', 'exercise', 'weight loss', 'arterial-venous fistula placement', 'renal replacement therapy', 'conservative methods of weight loss', 'kidney transplantation', 'surgical therapy', 'bariatric surgery', 'bariatric surgery', 'BMI', 'hypoglycemic agents', 'hemoglobin A1c', 'anti-hypertensive medication', 'BUN', 'creatinine', 'BMI', 'total weight loss', 'bariatric surgery', 'serum creatinine', 'BUN', 'random urinary protein', 'random urinary creatinine', 'urine protein/creatinine ratio', 'hemoglobin A1c', 'inverse creatinine', 'weight loss surgery', 'renal transplantation', 'left heart catheterization study', 'renal replacement therapy', 'dialysis', 'renal transplantation']","['status post', 'next 6 months', 'June 2003', 'September 2003', 'at 6 months', '6 months', 'next eight months', '15 months', 'March 2005', 'currently']"

The diagnosis of Behçet's disease was established 4 years prior to this admission, that had presented with oral aphtae, orchitis, right eye uveitis leading to blindness, recurrent pseudofolliculitis, knee arthritis, and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, all attributable to this autoimmune disorder. He had been treated by Prednisolone (15 mg/day) and Methotrexate (7.5 mg/week) for last 7 month.
Physical examination revealed III/VI to-and-fro murmur along the left sternal border and an S3 gallop. The posterior-anterior chest X-ray (Fig. ), computed tomography scan with intravenous contrast media at the level of T5–T8 (Fig. ), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. ), coronary angiography and echocardiography all revealed a 10.1 × 14.8 cm left ventricular pseudoaneurysm in the anterior wall of left ventricle. There was no narrowing suggesting coronary artery disease in his coronary angiography. In two-dimensional echocardiography, the typical features of pseudoaneurysm was noted including a relatively narrow neck in comparison with the diameter of the aneurysm, sharp discontinuity of the endocardium at the site at which the aneurysm communicates with the left ventricle, no noticeable valvular dysfunction, and left ventricular wall motion abnormalities. The orifice to radius ratio was not measurable due to the large size of pseudoaneurysm.
At surgery, the ostium (arrowhead in Fig. ) was measured 2.5 × 3.0 cm. The above mentioned results warranted a surgery with median sternotomy approach. After pericardotomy, a pulsatile mass appeared at the tip of left ventricle with a fistula to the heart. The pseudoaneurysm and large amounts of thrombus within it were resected, and the defect in the left ventricular wall was repaired by Teflon Plegeted Prolen 4/0. The patient made an uneventful recovery. The pathologic examination revealed a fibrous pseudoaneurysm including areas of old hemorrhage and thrombosis and chronic inflammation.

She had complained of symptoms for one week prior to admission, including light-headedness, headaches, and high blood pressure by self-measurement. Ten days prior to admission, the patient had been enrolled in a university-sponsored research trial designed to investigate the extent to which vitamin C and soy isoflavones, as supplements to a habitual diet, could provide antioxidant effects by reducing in vivo oxidative damage to cells, either alone or synergistically. During trial screening the patient reported typically consuming soy or soy products twice a week; no regular alcohol consumption; no history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease (although there was a family history of mild hypertension); no current medical supervision or care for any chronic health problems; no current use of over-the-counter or prescription medications and a routine exercise pattern of three times a week for 30–60 minutes. The participant weighed 175 pounds (79.5 kg), stood 5'8"" (1.73 m), with a body mass index of 26.7 kg/m2.
Early in the research trial, the patient was randomized to receive 500 mg vitamin C plus 5 mg/kg body weight soy isoflavones. On trial day 3, the patient reported to the investigators that she felt ""odd"" and ""light-headed."" At the time, this was not attributed to the study-related supplements because the participant reported experiencing infrequent headaches for the past 20 years. On trial days 6 and 7 of the treatment period, the participant had her blood pressure checked by an automated machine; the readings were in the range of 140–150/92–98 mmHg vs. her usual BP of 120/82 mmHg. Due to this unexpected occurrence, the investigators requested that she stop consuming the supplements and drop out of the study. The incident was reported the university's Institutional Review Board Research Compliance Office, and the research trial was allowed to continue. Unbeknownst to the investigators, the participant chose to ignore the request to discontinue the supplements and continued to take the supplements on trial days 8 and 9. On trial day 9 she found her BP to be 159/110 mmHg. That night, she experienced an intense headache, a feeling of anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. Around midday on trial day 10, she stopped by a regional medical center to have her BP checked by a medical professional before going hiking. At that time, her BP was 226/117 mmHg; she reported that ""my head feels like it is going to explode"" and she was admitted to the emergency room. Laboratory analyses, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel and thyroid stimulating hormone test, were all within normal limits. A CT scan of the head showed no abnormalities or intracranial hemorrhages and a 12 lead EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm. At this time, the participant reported to the physician a 20-year history of chronic headaches that had resolved with better sleep habits and a higher fluid intake. The participant was then given 20 mg of the alpha1 and beta-blocker labetalol HCl via intravenous infusion (see Table ). Subsequent to administration of the medication, the participant's blood pressure slowly dropped below critical levels, but did not reach normal limits. She was dismissed from the emergency room after 3 1/2 hours with a prescription for the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol HCl (Inderal LA), 80 mg once a day. She was told to discontinue the supplements that she was taking for the research trial.
The patient notified the trial investigator of the hypertensive event several days later. The hypertensive crisis was reported to the university's Institutional Review Board Research Compliance Office, and the research trial was allowed to continue with the stipulation that all participants submit to blood pressure monitoring weekly. Later that week, the participant's BP was measured by the primary investigator's staff and was still above normal limits. When the participant saw a cardiologist and her regular physician for further follow-up, no abnormalities in cardiac function, renal function or hormone levels were identified that could have led to the hypertensive crisis. The participant continued on antihypertensive medications for the next 12 months and was gradually able to decrease the dose of the medications over time.","[[51.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['cardiovascular', 'head', 'thyroid', 'head', 'intracranial', 'cardiac', 'renal']","['postmenopausal', 'hypertensive crisis', 'symptoms', 'light-headedness', 'headaches', 'high blood pressure', 'antioxidant effects', 'reducing in vivo oxidative damage to cells', 'in vivo oxidative damage to cells', 'typically consuming soy or soy products', 'alcohol consumption', 'hypertension', 'cardiovascular disease', 'hypertension', 'health problems', 'light-headed', 'headaches', 'headache', 'anxiety', 'difficulty sleeping', 'head feels like it is going to explode', 'abnormalities', 'intracranial hemorrhages', 'normal sinus rhythm', 'headaches', 'better sleep habits', 'higher fluid intake', 'hypertensive event', 'hypertensive crisis', 'abnormalities', 'hypertensive crisis']","['vitamin C', 'soy isoflavones', 'vitamin C', 'soy isoflavones', 'labetalol HCl', 'propranolol HCl', 'Inderal LA']","['51', 'regional medical center', 'eastern Arizona', 'university', ""university's"", 'regional medical center', 'emergency room', 'emergency room', ""university's""]","['blood pressure', 'habitual diet', 'trial screening', 'medical supervision', 'medical supervision or care', 'medications', 'routine exercise pattern', 'weighed', 'stood', 'body mass index', 'supplements', 'blood pressure', 'BP', 'stop consuming the supplements', 'supplements', 'supplements', 'BP', 'BP', 'BP', 'Laboratory', 'Laboratory analyses', 'complete blood count', 'metabolic panel', 'thyroid', 'thyroid stimulating hormone test', 'CT scan of the head', '12 lead EKG', 'medication', 'blood pressure', 'beta-blocker', 'supplements', 'blood pressure monitoring', 'BP', 'cardiac function', 'renal function', 'hormone levels', 'antihypertensive medications', 'medications']","['one week', 'prior to admission', 'Ten days', 'Ten days', 'prior to admission', 'prior to admission', 'twice a week', 'current', 'past 20 years', 'That night', 'At this time', '20-year', 'several days later', 'weekly', 'Later that week']"

Routine staging was done by computerized tomography (CT)-scan of the thorax and abdomen, ultrasonography, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and bronchoscopy. Functional evaluation was done by electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac ultrasonography and spiroergometry.
The CT-scan of the thorax and the mediastinum showed a tumor of the middle third of the esophagus with a suspicion of tumor infiltration of the thoracic aorta and the left main bronchus. However, infiltration of the main bronchus could be excluded by bronchoscopy. Infiltration of the thoracic aorta could also be excluded by MRI-angiography. The CT-scan of the abdomen and the abdominal ultrasound showed no signs of tumor spread. The PET-scan demonstrated a pathological tracer uptake at the level of the middle third of the esophagus with no signs of distal metastasis. Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy showed a tumor stenosis of 7 cm length, from 30 to 37 cm, and a diameter of 4 – 6 mm, further there was an intraluminal obstruction about more than 50 % which was additional confirmed by an esophagogram.
Transthoracic esophagectomy and 2-field lymphadenectomy was carried out as reported in literature [,]. Intraoperative frozen section showed no residual tumor at the lateral, distal and proximal margins. The mediastinal lymph nodes showed no signs of tumor infiltration. Reconstruction was done by orthotopic gastric pull-up and hand-sewn side to end collar esophago-gastrostomy. In order to perform postoperative early feeding a naso-jejunal catheter was introduced and placed distal to the duodeno-jejunal fold.
During the digital placement of the naso-jejunal feeding catheter a submucosal jejunal nodule with a diameter of 1 cm was detected about 40 cm distal to the duodeno-jejunal fold. The nodule was completely resected by jejunotomy. Intraoperative frozen section showed a submucosal metastasis of the esophagus. Further evaluation of the small intestine and the complete abdominal cavity showed no signs of metastasis.
Finally histopathological work-up of the specimens confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (Figure ) and a solitary submucosal jejunal metastasis. Furthermore, the submucosal jejunal metastasis was associated with local submucosal venous and lymphatic infiltration (Figure ). In immunhistochemical tests the tumor cells showed reaction to CEA and CK 5–6. The definitive staging was T3, N0, M1, L1, G3, R0.
The further course of the patient was uneventful and he could be discharged on the 14th postoperative day. As this was stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus adjuvant chemotherapy was not offered to the patient [].

172,1182401-1,16026628,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1182401.xml,Gastrointestinal autonomic nerve tumours – report of a case and review of literature,"A 70-year-old gentleman presented with a two-month history of bleeding per rectum and altered bowel habits. There was no history of tenesmus but sensation of incomplete evacuation following defecation as well as a feeling of a lump in the anal canal was present. His appetite and weight had been stable.
Clinically he looked well and abdominal examination revealed no abnormality. Per rectal examination revealed a mass in the posterior wall of the rectum with intact mucosa, which had significantly narrowed the lumen. Colonoscopy revealed the presence of a mass in the posterolateral wall of the rectum extending from 4 to 14 cm from the anal verge, with normal overlying mucosa. In addition, there was also a large sessile polyp in the descending colon and an ulceroproliferative growth at the splenic flexure; histopathology confirmed adenomatous polyp and adenocarcinoma respectively.
Computerised tomography (CT) of the pelvis showed thickening of the distal rectum with an obvious low density poorly enhancing lesion with possible calcification in its wall. Tissue plane between this lesion and prostate was not clearly seen but there was no infiltration of the ischiorectal fat (Figure ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a very large well-defined mass in the left presacral / ischio-anal fossa contiguous with rectal wall and thus almost certainly arising from one of the elements of the rectal wall (Figure ). Barium enema showed an apple core lesion in the splenic flexure (Figure ) as well as narrowing of the distal rectal lumen (Figure ).
The case was fully discussed at the colorectal multidisciplinary team meeting and all the surgical options including left hemicolectomy combined with rectosigmoidectomy plus transverse colostomy were fully evaluated. However, the consensus was that the additional presence of an adenocarcinoma as well as an adenoma higher up in the colon combined with the size of rectal schwannoma (12 cms) made panproctocolectomy with permanent ileostomy the best viable option. Furthermore, this was also the preferred choice of the patient as he opted to have an ileostomy rather than a colostomy. Surgery was performed without complications and the postoperative recovery was uneventful. At 6 months follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic.
Macroscopic examination of the resected specimen confirmed the malignant tumour in the splenic flexure, the polyp in the descending colon and a 10 × 12 cm tumour with a well-defined pseudocapsule in the postero-lateral wall of the mid and low rectum (Figure ). The surface of the latter lesion was fusiform with bluish-grey colour and its cut surface was irregularly lobulated with occasional cystic and necrotic areas.
Histopathology of the splenic flexure lesion showed an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (G1; Dukes B; Stage2). The polyp further down the colon was a tubulovillous adenoma with moderate focal dysplasia. The rectal tumour showed irregularly running fascicles of spindly to plump mesenchymal cells. The tumour was fairly vascularised with presence of a number of dilated and engorged vessels. The mitotic count was 4 per high power field. Some parts of the tumour were quite cellular while few areas were hypocellular reminiscent of the Antoni A and Antoni B patterns respectively (Figures and ). Immunostaining revealed strong reactivity for neuron specific enolase (NSE), vimentin, CD34 and focal positivity for S100 (Figures and ). Smooth muscle markers actin and desmin were negative.","[[70.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['rectum', 'bowel', 'anal canal', 'abdominal', 'rectal', 'posterior wall of the rectum', 'mucosa', 'lumen', 'posterolateral wall of the rectum', '4 to 14 cm from the anal verge', 'mucosa', 'descending colon', 'splenic flexure', 'pelvis', 'distal rectum', 'wall', 'Tissue plane', 'prostate', 'ischiorectal fat', 'left presacral', 'ischio-anal fossa', 'anal fossa', 'rectal wall', 'elements of the rectal wall', 'splenic flexure', 'distal rectal lumen', 'rectal lumen', 'colorectal', 'colon', 'rectal', 'splenic flexure', 'descending colon', 'postero-lateral wall of the mid and low rectum', 'splenic flexure', 'colon', 'rectal', 'fascicles of spindly to plump mesenchymal cells', 'vessels', 'Smooth muscle', 'muscle']","['bleeding per rectum', 'altered bowel habits', 'tenesmus', 'sensation of incomplete evacuation', 'defecation', 'lump', 'appetite and weight had been stable', 'looked well', 'abnormality', 'mass', 'intact mucosa', 'narrowed the lumen', 'mass', 'normal overlying mucosa', 'sessile polyp', 'ulceroproliferative growth', 'adenomatous polyp', 'adenocarcinoma', 'thickening of the distal rectum', 'lesion', 'calcification', 'lesion', 'infiltration of the ischiorectal fat', 'mass', 'apple core lesion', 'narrowing of the distal rectal lumen', 'adenocarcinoma', 'adenoma', 'rectal schwannoma', 'complications', 'postoperative recovery was uneventful', 'asymptomatic', 'malignant tumour', 'polyp', 'tumour', 'pseudocapsule', 'surface of the latter lesion', 'cut surface was irregularly lobulated', 'cystic', 'necrotic areas', 'splenic flexure lesion', 'adenocarcinoma', 'polyp', 'tubulovillous adenoma', 'focal dysplasia', 'rectal tumour', 'irregularly running fascicles of spindly to plump mesenchymal cells', 'tumour', 'dilated and engorged vessels', 'tumour', 'hypocellular', 'Antoni A and Antoni B patterns', 'strong reactivity', 'S100']",[],['70'],"['rectal examination', 'Colonoscopy', 'histopathology', 'Computerised tomography (CT) of the pelvis', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'MRI', 'Barium enema', 'left hemicolectomy', 'rectosigmoidectomy', 'transverse colostomy', 'panproctocolectomy', 'permanent ileostomy', 'ileostomy', 'colostomy', 'Surgery', 'Macroscopic examination of the resected specimen', 'Histopathology', 'mitotic count', 'Immunostaining', 'neuron specific enolase', 'NSE', 'vimentin', 'CD34', 'focal positivity for S100', 'Smooth muscle markers actin', 'actin', 'desmin']","['two-month', 'two-month']"
173,1183227-1,15989688,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1183227.xml,Benign gastro-bronchial fistula – an uncommon complication of esophagectomy: case report,"A 67-year-old man with past history of Ivor Lewis esophagectomy 6 years previously for a Barrett's esophagus presented with dysphagia, recurrent cough, regurgitation and weight-loss. Endoscopy suggested a benign anastomotic stricture, for which he underwent dilatation. However his symptoms worsened and he continued to lose weight in spite of supervised dietary therapy. Aspiration was suspected and a barium swallow was performed. This demonstrated pharyngeal in-coordination, as the probable cause of aspiration. A repeat endoscopy was non-contributory. A feeding jejunostomy was inserted to prevent continued weight loss. In spite of this, he continued to have repeated chest infections resulting in extensive bronchiectatic changes in the right lower lobe.
A tracheostomy was planned at this stage to prevent aspiration. Whilst he was being intubated for the procedure, air was noted to escape from the right bronchus. A bronchoscopy revealed the presence of the GBF, with the bronchial opening in the right main stem bronchus located about 1 cm below the tracheal bifurcation and the gastric opening midway down the lesser curvature of the gastric conduit. The temporal sequence of events suggests that fistulation had occurred at the time of anastomotic dilatation, and thus the worsening of symptoms following the procedure. The fistula was however, difficult to diagnose in spite of extensive investigations leading to unexpected finding in the anaesthetic room.
Given his debilitated condition and poor respiratory function stenting was considered to occlude the fistula. However as the fistula was positioned in the middle of the gastric conduit (Figure ) it was not deemed amenable to stenting due to poor fixation of the stent and risk of migration. And similarly satisfactory stenting of right main stem bronchus was difficult to achieve due to short length of this bronchus and consequent tendency to migrate. Though associated with greater risk of morbidity and mortality, a surgical approach was deemed the best approach for this problem.
At operation a right-sided re-thoracotomy was performed and careful dissection carried out to display the anatomy of the GBF (Figure ). The fistula was excised with a cuff of healthy gastric conduit and bronchial tissue. The gastric and bronchial openings were closed directly with absorbable stitches with interposition of bovine pericardium in between the two suture lines.

Her total leukocyte count was 1.7 × 109/l, (neutrophils 51%, lymphocytes 43%, monocytes 5%). Urinalysis was normal and thin and thick film examinations of the peripheral blood were negative for malaria. The patient also tested negative for HIV. A blood Widal test however, showed a titre of 80 against ""O"" (somatic) antigen and 160 against the ""H"" (flagella) antigen of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (recommended cut-off titre in our hospital: ≥ 1:80 and ≥ 1:160 for the ""O"" and ""H"" antigens respectively). Blood culture grew Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Two months prior to her illness, she had suffered from an attack of suspected typhoid fever and had been treated with chloramphenicol 500 mg every 6 hours for 14 days.
Antibiogram of the isolated S. enterica serovar Typhi was performed by disc diffusion techniques as recommended by NCCLS guidelines [], Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin were determined by agar dilution method []. The antibiotic discs used included ampicillin 10 μg (Beecham), co-trimoxazole 1.25/23.75 μg (Roche), chloramphenicol 30 μg (Antibioticos SA), ciprofloxacin 5 μg (Bayer), nalidixic acid 30 μg (Sigma) and ceftriaxone 30 μg (Roche). The isolate was found resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol, but susceptible to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin by disc diffusion test. The MICs of ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid were 0.5 μg/ml and 32.0 μg/ml respectively. The patient remained febrile after 7 days of oral administration of 500 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 hours.

He had moderate gastroesophageal reflux and mild dysphagia. A barium swallow revealed compression and displacement of the proximal thoracic esophagus. Esophageal mucosal ulcerations were not observed. Integrated positron emission tomography(PET)/CT scan using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) showed no uptake in the lesion. Due to the benign clinical features of the mass, the differential diagnosis included benign neoplasms such as a leiomyoma or a benign thyroid neoplasm. The possibility of lymphadenopathy secondary to metastatic adenocarcinoma was remote. Endoscopic ultrasound was performed using the UC-30P (Olympus, America, Melville, NY) and revealed a 52- × 39-mm hypoechoic, well-circumscribed posterior mediastinal mass in the thoracic inlet approximately 22 cm from the incisor (Figure ). After using color Doppler ultrasound, EUS-FNA of the mediastinal mass was performed. Adequate material was obtained for on-site rapid cytopathologic interpretation.

The tumor had measured 7 × 5 cm. The mass had been present for 10 years. At physical examination there was evidence of recent surgery and the patient had a 1 cm ipsilateral axillary lymph node. Serum tumor markers and other routine blood test were normal. The liver ultrasonography, chest X-ray and bone scan were negative for metastases.
He underwent a modified radical mastectomy. Residual tumor measuring 2.8 cm × 2.6 cm was present. On macroscopic examination the tumor was firm and circumscribed (Figure ). Microscopy showed the classical features of secretory carcinoma with a microcystic pattern (Figure ) with abundant intra and extracellular secretory material. No tumor was present at the surgical margins. Colloidal iron staining highlighted the secretory material (Figure ). On immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were positive for S-100 protein (Figure ) but negative for estrogen and progesterone receptor and HER2 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). 2 of 24 resected lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma.
The case was investigated for the t(12;15) ETV6-NTRK3 translocation using two complementary probe sets []. A t(12;15) translocation fusion probe assay (Fig. ) and a chromosome 15 NTRK3 gene split-apart assay (Fig. ) were used to detect the t(12;15) translocation. All BAC clones used in this study were obtained from the BACPAC Resources Centre at the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute. All probes were labeled by nick translation with the use of the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Vysis, Downer's Grove, Illinois). BAC clones RP11-434C1 and RP11-407P10 telomeric to ETV6 on 12p were labeled with spectrum orange. On chromosome 15, RP11-114I9 and RP11-730G13, centromeric to NTRK3 on 15q were labeled with spectrum green and clone RP11-247E14, telomeric to NTRK3 was labeled with spectrum orange. Six-micrometer tissue sections were baked overnight at 60C and then subjected to FISH with a modified protocol (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL) []. FISH signals were analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescent microscope equipped with a COHU-CCD camera. Images were captures with Metasystems ISIS software (MetaSystems Group Inc., Belmont MA) with seven focal planes stacked for the analysis.
In view of the nodal metastasis it was decided to treat the patient with six courses of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (FAC). The patient abandoned treatment after the second course. The patient returned to clinic eighteen months later with two hard nodules in the surgical resection area measuring 8 × 8 cm and 4 cm × 4 cm, (one ulcerated), and three left axillary subcutaneous nodules, two measuring 2 × 2 cm and one 3 × 3 cm (Figure ).
A chest CT scan identified pulmonary metastases with a right pleural effusion (Fig. ). The effusion was drained via percutaneous thoracentesis. He then began treatment with concurrent radiation (total dose of 60 Gy) and UFT (Tegafur-Uracil) to the chest followed by systemic UFT as a single agent for 3 months.

Her main complaints were fatigue and drowsiness. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and auscultation of the heart and lungs were normal. The patient was treated with sodiumsulfate and charcoal and was admitted to the intensive care unit for continuous control of vital signs. Routine laboratory studies (hematology, chemistry) were normal. Plasma levels of diazepam and temazepam were elevated, 1155 ugr/l (normal: 125 – 750 ugr/l) and 1710 ugr/l (normal: 300–900 ugr/l, respectively). Plasma levels of sertraline and desmethylsertraline were 174 ug/l (normal 20–55 ug/l []) and 276 ng/l, respectively.
Her ECG upon admission (upper panel of the figure) shows a sinus rhythm (77 b.p.m.) without conduction disturbances. QT interval in lead V2 was 370 ms. We used the Bazett method (QT time divided by the square root of the RR interval) to calculate the corrected QT (QTc). QTc at admission was 420 ms and negative T-waves were found in leads V1–V3. A second ECG, taken one day after admission (lower panel of the figure), showed a markedly prolonged QT interval with deepened negative T waves in leads V1–V3. QT interval was 520 ms in V2, at a heart rate (HR) of 63 b.p.m (QTc 525 ms). An old ECG (august 2002) showed a sinus rhythm with a HR of 63 b.p.m and a QT interval in lead V2 of 370 ms (QTc 373 ms; ECG not shown).
After 4 days the patient was discharged to a psychiatric hospital because the risk for another suicide attempt was deemed high by the psychiatric consultant. After discharge, the patient underwent further out-patient cardiac evaluation. Echocardiography revealed no structural heart disease. On exercise electrocardiography, patient reached 88% of her maximum HR – no abnormal ST-segment changes were observed.

She had a history of repeated episodes of abdominal pain in the past. The symptoms had begun some years earlier, causing several hospitalizations and two laparoscopic interventions.
Medical history revealed allergic coryza and neurodermatitis, but no food allergy. No other diseases were reported.
Laboratory rendered a high white blood cell count (WBC) 13.300 × 109/liter with an eosinophil count of 58% and CRP 5.2 mg/l. Laparoscopy showed a large amount of ascites and swollen intraabdominal lymph nodes. Thus, screening for tuberculosis was initiated. A chest x-ray showed no signs of pulmonary disease, Mantoux test and all cultures remained negative. However, one pcr from ascites was positive and the diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis was established. The patient was started on rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Despite treatment symptoms persisted for the following six month.
On admission the patient was still under therapy with rifampicin and isoniazid. Physical examination demonstrated diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs. The WBC was 13100 × 109/liter with an eosinophilic count of 53 %, total IgE 1870 kU/l and CRP 32 mg/l. Clinical and laboratory indices for autoimmune disease were absent. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography showed ubiquitous ascites and thickening of the wall of the lower oesophagus, stomach and bowel (Fig. ). The patient developed severe abdominal pain, only controlled by opoid analgesia. An iliac crest biopsy showed an eosinophilic count over 40 percent but no signs of leukaemia. Again the ascitic fluid rendered a high eosinophilic count. Blood tests as well as stool cultures and microscopy for ova and parasites were negative. Endoscopy of the upper intestinum and the colon showed no abnormalities of the intestinal mucosa. Remarkably biopsies from oesophagus, stomach, ileum and colon yielded distinct eosinophilic infiltrations reaching the lamina propria which finally lead to the diagnosis of a primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder (Fig. ).
Thus, this patient fulfilled all diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Since active tuberculosis was ruled out we stopped anti-mycobacterial treatment.
The patient was switched to 40 mg prednisone per day. Symptoms were alleviated quickly in the beginning. The patient was set on a taper. Reaching a dose of 10 mg a day symptoms started again. Therefore the dose was doubled and Montelukast 10 mg/d was started. The symptoms resolved within days and the prednisone could be tapered within six weeks. Currently, the patient remains completely off steroids. She has been symptom free for the last 24 months under Montelukast.

The patient had fatigue, anaemia, anorexia and bone pain for several months. The fine needle aspiration of the neck mass, performed before the admission showed the presence of malignant cells. Preoperative laboratory findings are reported in table .
Ultrasonography of the neck showed an enlarged thyroid gland with substernal extension; many solid nodules and some calcifications were present. The computerised tomographic (CT) scan showed a large solid mass in left neck, with extension to the mediastinum, and displacement of the trachea, oesophagus and great vessels (Figure ). Tracheobronchoscopy demonstrated substenosis of the proximal trachea due to extrinsic compression.
Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy demonstrated diffuse radiopharmaceutical uptake within the thyroid region and the lower portion of the neck. This tracer accumulation corresponded to the mass and it was persistent during the different phases of the scintigraphy without significant changes (Figure ). The lack of a spot area of increased MIBI uptake ruled out the diagnosis of adenoma. The scintigraphic pattern was classified as due to a multinodular goitre.
The patient was vigorously hydrated and bisphosphonates were given preoperatively to control hypercalcemia. Eight days later the serum calcium level decreased to 10.4 mg/dl. With the above clinical findings, the patient underwent surgical neck exploration.
At surgery a voluminous cervicomediastinal firm mass was found that could not be removed via the superior thoracic strait; therefore a complete sternotomy was performed. The surgical findings revealed an ovoid, grayish-yellow, hard mass, measuring 12 × 9 × 8 cm, adherent to the base of the left lobe of the thyroid, extending to the anterior upper mediastinum; the recurrent laryngeal nerve was laterally displaced but not invaded. Therefore en bloc resection of the mass along with the total thyroid gland and the connective tissue apparently involved in the tumour was performed. All the lymphoid tissue from the ipsilateral tracheoesophageal groove to the upper mediastinum was removed
The histological report described a parenchymatous thyroid gland, with a subcapsular gelatinous nodule (1 cm diameter). The voluminous tumour adherent to the base of left lobe was multinodular, greyish-yellow. Histologically many fibrous bands of acellular collagenous tissue extending from the thickened capsule, subdivided the neoplasm into irregular compartments. The tumour cells, arranged in trabecular and solid sheets, were homogeneous; they showed round – ovoid nuclei, with evident nucleoli, and clear cytoplasm; occasionally cytoplasm was abundant, eosinophilic and granular; nuclei were pleomorphic; mitoses were present (3 per 10 HPF). Rare multinucleated osteoclastic-like giant cells were found around foci of haemorrhage; necrosis and coarse calcifications were observed. Both capsular and vascular invasion were present at the periphery of neoplasm. In the infiltrated adjacent adipose tissue, well-circumscribed, encapsulated nodules of tumour, with a peripheral rim of lymphoid tissue were found; they were considered to be metastatic lymph nodes. Final diagnosis was a parathyroid carcinoma (Figure ). The postoperative course was complicated by transient oligouria, with worsening the chronic renal failure.

The patient was admitted to the District Hospital for investigation of macroscopic haematuria and lumbar pain during the last 48 hours. He had a past medical history of hypertension and hepatitis B. The laboratory investigations revealed hypercalcaemia and in an abdominal ultrasound scan (US), a mass was detected in the retroperitoneal space close to the left kidney. Then a Computed Tomography (CT) scan with contrast was performed which revealed an enhancing mass, 10 cm in diameter, between the pancreas and the left kidney originating from the left adrenal gland. No other pathological findings from intra or extra-peritoneal organs were identified (Figure ). The serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration was 75.6 ng/ml (normal range: 0–10 ng/ml) and C19-9 concentration 37.6 ng/ml, while the liver function tests were normal.
After his admission to our Department, the patient was tested for underlying hormonally active tumor by low dose (1 mg) overnight dexamethasone suppression test and a 24-hour urine collection for catecholamines, cortisol, 17-ketosteroids, metanephrines and vanillylmandelic acid. As the patient was hypertensive, plasma aldosterone and plasma rennin were also tested. None of the tests indicated a functional adrenal tumor. The patient was under surveillance due to hepatitis B and had been subjected to AFP measurement and US scan 2, 8 and 14 months prior to his admission (AFP: 65, 69 and 60 ng/ml respectively). Regarding the facts that there was not remarkable increase in the AFP level during the last 14 months, the multiple US scans were negative and the CT scan on admission did not reveal any intrahepatic lesion, HCC was not considered in our patient.
With a presumptive diagnosis of a non-functional adrenal tumor, the patient underwent left adrenalectomy through a left Köcher incision. The exploration of the other intra-peritoneal organs did not reveal any other palpable lesions while the liver was found to be cirrhotic during the operation. The resected lesion was a firm elastic mass measuring 11.5 cm by 7.5 cm (Figure ). The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 7. Histologically, the resected lesion was a poorly differentiated metastatic HCC with trabecullar patterns. The patient was then informed of the findings and contacted for readmission, further investigation and adjuvant therapy. However, despite our repeated attempts, the patient refused to be subjected to any further investigation or treatment.
Seven months later patient presented with cachexia, icterus, abdominal discomfort and significant weight loss (more than 10 % of body weight). The serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration was 1620.5 ng/ml and the serum bilirubin 5.4 mg/dL. CT scan revealed hyperdense lesions of the liver (Figure ). Even though Trans-Arterial Embolization (TAE) was then performed, the serum AFP concentration showed persistently elevation to 3543 ng/ml one month later, and the patient died 3 months after readmission due to rapidly progressive liver failure.","[[76.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['retro-peritoneal space', 'left adrenal gland', 'lumbar', 'abdominal', 'retroperitoneal space close to the left kidney', 'pancreas', 'left kidney', 'left adrenal gland', 'intra or extra-peritoneal organs', 'liver', 'adrenal', 'intrahepatic', 'adrenal', 'left Köcher', 'intra-peritoneal organs', 'liver', 'trabecullar', 'abdominal', 'liver', 'Trans-Arterial', 'liver']","['tumor', 'macroscopic haematuria', 'lumbar pain', 'hypertension', 'hepatitis', 'hepatitis B.', 'hypercalcaemia', 'mass', 'enhancing mass', 'pathological findings', 'tumor', 'hypertensive', 'functional adrenal tumor', 'hepatitis B', 'intrahepatic lesion', 'HCC', 'adrenal tumor', 'lesions', 'cirrhotic', 'elastic mass', 'uneventful', 'resected lesion', 'lesion', 'metastatic HCC', 'trabecullar patterns', 'cachexia', 'icterus', 'abdominal discomfort', 'weight loss', 'hyperdense lesions of the liver', 'died', 'liver failure']",[],"['76', 'District Hospital', 'District Hospital']","['treatment', 'laboratory', 'abdominal ultrasound scan (US)', 'Computed Tomography (CT) scan with contrast', 'serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration', 'C19-9 concentration', 'liver function tests', 'dexamethasone suppression test', 'urine collection', 'catecholamines', 'cortisol', '17-ketosteroids', 'metanephrines', 'vanillylmandelic acid', 'plasma aldosterone', 'plasma rennin', 'AFP measurement', 'US scan', 'AFP', 'AFP level', 'US scans', 'CT scan', 'left adrenalectomy through a left Köcher incision', 'exploration of the other intra-peritoneal organs', 'operation', 'resected lesion', 'Histologically', 'adjuvant therapy', 'treatment', 'serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration', 'serum bilirubin', 'CT scan', 'Trans-Arterial Embolization (TAE)', 'serum AFP concentration']","['last 48 hours', 'last 48 hours', 'overnight', '24-hour', '2, 8 and 14 months', '2, 8 and 14 months', 'prior to his admission', 'prior to his admission', 'last 14 months', 'postoperative', 'Seven months later', 'Seven months later', 'Seven months later', 'Seven months later', 'one month later', '3 months']"

The patient had no relevant past medical or family history, and laboratory data were all within normal limits. A cystoscopic examination was performed and a transurethral resection of a tiny, sessile polypoid lesion of the bladder neck was carried out. Clinical evaluation included ultrasonography and computerized tomography (CT) scan. The patients was seen at last follow-up 14 months after diagnosis and he was completely negative.
Grossly, the tumor was a well-circumscribed, small ovoid nodule of 0.4 cm in diameter. Histologically a polypoid tumor appeared to be covered by slightly attenuated normal urothelium. The tumor filled-up the lamina propria showing a predominantly glandular arrangement (Fig ), with scanty anastomosing cords of cuboidal cells with fairly regular nuclei. Foci of von Brunn nests were seen at the periphery near the urothelium (Fig ). Mitoses and necrosis were not seen. A panel of immunostains, including antibodies against keratin 7, βHCG, chromogranin, synaptophysin, S-100 protein, NSE, serotonin, calcitonin, TTF-1, progesteron, and p53 protein was applied to representative sections of the tumor using the avidin-biotin complex technique (tab ).
Immunohistochemically the tumor strongly reacted with synaptophysin (Fig ), chromogranin (Fig ), calcitonin (Fig ), keratin 7 (Fig ), and NSE. βHCG was positive in about 10% of the neoplastic cells. p53 protein, progesteron, S-100 protein, serotonin and TTF-1 were negative.","[[68.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['transurethral', 'bladder neck', 'lamina propria', 'glandular', 'cuboidal cells', 'periphery near the urothelium']","['macroscopic hematuria', 'polypoid lesion of the bladder neck', 'tumor', 'ovoid nodule', 'polypoid tumor', 'tumor filled-up the lamina propria', 'glandular arrangement', 'anastomosing cords of cuboidal cells', 'regular nuclei', 'Foci of von Brunn nests', 'Mitoses', 'necrosis', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'neoplastic cells']",[],"['68', 'January 2004']","['laboratory data', 'cystoscopic examination', 'transurethral resection of a tiny, sessile polypoid lesion of the bladder neck', 'ultrasonography', 'computerized tomography (CT) scan', 'Histologically', 'panel of immunostains', 'immunostains', 'antibodies against keratin 7', 'chromogranin', 'synaptophysin', 'S-100', 'S-100 protein', 'NSE', 'serotonin', 'calcitonin', 'TTF-1', 'progesteron', 'p53 protein', 'Immunohistochemically', 'synaptophysin', 'chromogranin', 'calcitonin', 'keratin 7', 'NSE', 'p53 protein', 'progesteron', 'S-100 protein', 'serotonin', 'TTF-1']",['January 2004']
183,1190177-1,16042804,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1190177.xml,Cardiac conduction abnormalities and congenital immunodeficiency in a child with Kabuki syndrome: Case report,"J.R. was a 3210 gram child born to a 21-year-old gravida 1, para 1 mother by vaginal delivery at 36 weeks of gestation. The mother received appropriate prenatal care and the pregnancy was uncomplicated. There was no gestational history of tobacco, alcohol, illicit substance or medication use. A cardiac echogenic focus and possible anatomic heart defect was noted on routine prenatal ultrasound examination and the child was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit for management at birth. A thoracic echocardiogram showed mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta. Surgical repair of the coarctation was conducted. A right diaphragmatic eventration was simultaneously repaired. During this initial hospitalization no cardiac arrhythmias were monitored on telemetry. Due to the structural heart defects a chromosome analysis including fluorescence in situ hybridization for both DiGeorge loci was performed and revealed no abnormalities. A diagnosis of Kabuki syndrome was made by two independent geneticists based on phenotypic features. Clinical features in this child consistent with the diagnosis of Kabuki syndrome included arched eyebrows with sparse hair laterally, eversion of the lateral lower eyelid, a cleft palate, bifid uvula, broad nasal root with depressed nasal tip, and persistent fetal finger tip pads with otherwise normal dermatoglyphics. Neuroimaging revealed severe corpus callosum hypoplasia and ophthalmologic examination showed optic nerve atrophy bilaterally. Congenital hypothyroidism was also detected. Further cytogenetic analysis using telomere probes was conducted without detection of abnormalities.
The subsequent hospital course was complicated by numerous infections secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia and he was finally discharged to home at 3 months of age. After one week at home, he was noted to be cyanotic and non-responsive and was re-admitted to the hospital where the patient was considered to be septic and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics.
At 6.5 months of age, he was admitted to the hospital with a urinary tract infection. Sinus bradyarrythmia was recorded associated with hypoxemia with prolonged pauses progressing to asystole. Resuscitation with epinephrine was successful. Bronchoscopy was performed and showed normal airways. A cardiac echocardiogram showed diastolic dysfunction. He was started on supplemental O2 at 1/8 L by nasal canula and received furosemide, aldactazide and verapamil. No other episodes of cardiac rhythm disturbance were noted on telemetry during the remaining hospital stay.
At 9 months of age, he was admitted to the hospital in respiratory distress. He was ventilated mechanically and monitored in the ICU. While on cardiac monitoring he developed a tachyarrhythmia without 1:1 conduction then prolongation of the QT interval followed by an idioventricular rhythm which slowed to asystole. External pacing failed. After alternate doses of epinephrine and atropine the patient returned to sinus rhythm. Thoracic echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function with normal velocities across inlet and outlet valves. Troponin levels remained less than 1 and there was no other evidence of ischemia. Because of the previous episodes of bradyarrythmia, a dual chamber epicardial pacemaker was placed without complications. His ventricular and diastolic function normalized and diuretics were discontinued. He remained hemodynamically stable but continued hospitalization was required for various nosocomial infections. The family elected to make an advance directive to prevent further resuscitative efforts. Approximately one month later during hospitalization for respiratory bronchiolitis, he had another episode of bradyarrythmia which progressed to asystole and death. The pacemaker was queried and found to have functioned within normal parameters. The family consented for a limited autopsy.
The heart weighed twice the normal expected weight and there was biventricular hypertrophy, with the right ventricular wall thickness being about four times the normal thickness and the left ventricular wall thickness about twice normal (Figure ). The right atrium and the coronary sinus were dilated and the left atrium was small with endocardial fibroelastosis (Figure ). The mitral valve was stenotic, the circumference being about 3/4ths the normal circumference. The valve leaflets were thick and myxoid, and the chordae tendinae were shortened. The posterior leaflet of the mitral valve was directly inserted into the papillary muscle. There was mild aortic stenosis and the aortic valve leaflets were thick and dysplastic. The pulmonary valve circumference was about one-third greater than normal. The membranous portion of the interventricular septum was about three times the normal length and mapping of the junctional tissue revealed that the atrioventricular node was displaced caudally and the bifurcation of the Bundle of His was likewise displaced caudally (Figure ). The valve leaflet was made up of primarily mucopolysaccharide material (blue stain). The placement of the pacemaker was verified to be appropriate and dense adhesions were present between the pacer wires and the abdominal wall and bowel loops.
Postmortem pulmonary angiogram revealed severe pruning of the pulmonary vascular tree (Figure ) and absence of the background 'blush' produced by filling of intracinar arteries. Microscopic examination revealed marked luminal narrowing or fibrous occlusion of intra-acinar arteries (Figure ). In addition there was marked dilatation of lymphatics within pulmonary septa.
The patient exhibited recurrent infections requiring numerous hospitalizations. These included Klebsiella pneumonia, RSV pneumonia, Enterococcus sepsis, Candida albicans urinary tract infection, Enterobacter urosepsis, sinusitis and otitis media.
Immune evaluation revealed persistent lymphopenia; however, the percentages of T-, B-, and NK-cell subpopulations were normal (Table ). Furthermore, lymphoproliferative responses to mitogens PHA, PWM and alloantigens were normal. However, lymphoproliferative response to Concavalin A stimulation was absent. Serum IgG and IgA levels were markedly decreased, and antibody responses to tetanus toxoid and Hemophilus influenzae type B (HiB) were decreased. Following immunization with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar), antibody responses were decreased to 4 of 7 serotypes. Serum albumin levels were normal, and there was no evidence of protein loss through the gastrointestinal or urinary systems, and there was no evidence of chylous thorax. Thus, IVIG therapy was initiated. However, the patient shortly succumbed from cardiac arrhythmia. Autopsy revealed severe thymic involution (the thymus weighed 1 g.) and lymphoid depletion in the spleen.
Other findings included nesidioblastosis, vacuolation of the adrenal cortex, undescended testes, contraction band necrosis of the muscularis propria of the gastro-intestinal tract and growth retardation with growth parameters being < 3rd percentile.","[[21.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['vaginal', 'cardiac', 'heart', 'thoracic', 'mitral', 'aortic', 'aorta', 'right diaphragmatic', 'cardiac',

The clinical examination showed a single fistula opening on the perineum with purulent secretion. A second opening was found on the posterior wall of the vagina.
The MRI-scanning revealed a large formation in the lower pelvis reaching to the sacrum. This mass showed a thickened, contrast-enhancing wall and necrotic, liquid inner parts suggestive of abscess-formation. No involvement of the small bowel or bladder was detected (Figures , , ).
The patient's history revealed Crohn's disease first diagnosed in 1981. Ten years later (1991), the patient was readmitted because of severe perineal fistula disease. The clinical and radiological examination showed multiple transphincteric fistulas and a single rectovaginal fistula as well as one enterocutaneous fistula originating from the terminal ileum. After medical management (parenteral nutrition and corticoids) she was referred to the department of surgery where an ileocoecal resection with a diversion ileostomy and drainage of the perianal fistulas were performed. Postoperatively the patient developed all signs of an Addison crisis, which could be satisfactorily treated.
The patient was readmitted in 1993 with a new inflammatory episode including perianal fistulating disease. Because of the disease recurrence and due to further impairment of the sphincter mechanism a proctocolectomy with exstirpation of the sphincter ani muscles and a terminal ileostomy was recommended and performed. The histopathological examination showed signs of Crohn's disease with some epitheloid cell granulomas and giant cells as well as microgranulomas in both the large bowel and the rectum. No signs of malignancy and no dysplastic changes were found. The patient developed a paralytic ileus that could be treated conservatively and a perianal wound infection which required secondary wound closure.
Three years later, in 1996, the patient was readmitted because of a persistent perineal secretion. No fistulas and no signs of Crohn's disease could be found in the small bowel. The patient was treated with local wound therapy without any further surgical procedure until readmission in 2004.
After informed consent a perineal drainage with entire resection of the clinically inflamed tissue was performed. Intraoperatively the tissue showed a colloidal consistency and fistulation into the coccygeal bone and the vagina. Histological analysis of the tissue detected a mucinous adenocarcinoma occupying the resected tissue and the resection margins. The tumour consisted of moderately atypical glandular cell elements lying in pools of PAS-positive mucin. A distinct fibroblastic stromal reaction could be found in the surrounding mesenchyma.
Upon diagnosis, a second intervention was performed including an en-bloc exenteration of the uterus, vagina and ovaries via laparotomy and resection of the sacrum through a posterior approach. The pelvis was closed using a Vypro® mesh (polypropylene-polygalactine composite) and the perineum was left open for secondary wound healing.
Postoperatively, bladder function was impaired, otherwise the patient recovered well and could be dismissed into out patient oncological care.
Examination of the specimen showed typical cylindrical epithelium of colorectal type lining some residual lumina of fistulas and cysts (Figure ). The resection margins did not show any residual fistulas. No rests of original bowel mucosa or remaining bowel wall structures could be found in the ""en-bloc"" specimen. But there were some minor residual carcinomatous infiltrates in the soft tissues between coccygeal bone and dorsal wall of the vagina (Figure ). Bone tissue and the vaginal wall structures themselves proofed to be free of tumour histologically. No florid, ulcerating or granulomatous inflammation was found in the remaining mucosal tissues.","[[50.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['gluteal', 'perineal', 'perineum', 'posterior wall of the vagina', 'lower pelvis', 'sacrum', 'small bowel', 'bladder', 'perineal', 'rectovaginal', 'enterocutaneous', 'terminal ileum', 'ileocoecal', 'perianal', 'perianal', 'sphincter', 'sphincter ani muscles', 'large bowel', 'rectum', 'perianal', 'perineal', 'small bowel', 'perineal', 'tissue', 'coccygeal bone', 'vagina', 'tissue', 'resected tissue', 'tissue', 'resection margins', 'glandular cell elements', 'surrounding mesenchyma', 'uterus', 'vagina', 'ovaries', 'sacrum', 'pelvis', 'perineum', 'bladder', 'epithelium of colorectal type lining', 'lumina', 'resection margins', 'bowel mucosa', 'bowel wall structures', 'soft tissues', 'soft tissues between coccygeal bone', 'dorsal wall of the vagina', 'Bone tissue', 'vaginal wall structures', 'mucosal tissues']","['fistula formation', 'fistula opening', 'purulent secretion', 'second opening', 'formation', 'mass', 'thickened', 'contrast-enhancing wall', 'necrotic', 'liquid inner parts', 'abscess-formation', 'involvement of the small bowel or bladder', ""Crohn's disease"", 'perineal fistula disease', 'transphincteric fistulas', 'rectovaginal fistula', 'enterocutaneous fistula', 'perianal fistulas', 'Addison crisis', 'inflammatory episode', 'perianal fistulating disease', 'disease', 'impairment of the sphincter', 'impairment of the sphincter mechanism', ""Crohn's disease"", 'epitheloid cell granulomas', 'giant cells', 'microgranulomas', 'malignancy', 'dysplastic changes', 'paralytic ileus', 'perianal wound infection', 'perineal secretion', 'fistulas', ""Crohn's disease"", 'colloidal consistency', 'fistulation', 'mucinous adenocarcinoma', 'tumour', 'atypical glandular cell elements', 'PAS-positive mucin', 'fibroblastic stromal reaction', 'perineum was left open', 'secondary wound healing', 'wound healing', 'bladder function was impaired', 'recovered well', 'cylindrical epithelium of colorectal type lining', 'fistulas', 'cysts', 'fistulas', 'rests of original bowel mucosa', 'carcinomatous infiltrates', 'tumour', 'florid', 'ulcerating', 'granulomatous inflammation']",[],"['October 2004', '50-year', '1981', '1991', 'department', '1993', '1996', '2004']","['proctocolectomy', 'examination', 'MRI-scanning', 'clinical and radiological examination', 'radiological examination', 'medical management', 'parenteral nutrition', 'corticoids', 'ileocoecal resection', 'diversion ileostomy', 'drainage of the perianal fistulas', 'proctocolectomy', 'exstirpation of the sphincter ani muscles', 'terminal ileostomy', 'histopathological examination', 'secondary wound closure', 'local wound therapy', 'surgical procedure', 'perineal drainage', 'entire resection of the clinically inflamed tissue', 'Histological analysis of the tissue', 'intervention', 'en-bloc exenteration of the uterus, vagina and ovaries via laparotomy', 'resection of the sacrum through a posterior approach', 'pelvis was closed using a Vypro® mesh (polypropylene-polygalactine composite)', 'perineum was left open for secondary wound healing', 'Examination']","['eleven years earlier', '1981', 'Ten years later', '1991', 'Postoperatively']"

Laboratory investigations demonstrated leukocytosis, modestly elevated liver enzymes, and lactic acidosis. Computed tomography scanning revealed marked hepatomegaly with an extensive infiltrative process and ultrasound demonstrated normal bile ducts. Baseline imaging of his abdomen was planned for staging, however it was not conducted prior to his presentation to hospital.
On day two of his admission the patient deteriorated with respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. He had oliguria, and hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation. Rapidly progressive multi-system organ failure developed with anuria/azotemia requiring continuous renal replacement therapy. Liver failure ensued as evidenced by coagulopathy refractory to plasma infusions and by progressive transaminitis and hyperbilirubinema. He developed distributive shock requiring maximal pressor support. There were significant biochemical derangements including hyperkalemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia and hypocalcemia. Hemodialysis was commenced to rectify the hyperkalemia and acidosis that was refractory to continuous renal replacement therapy. An aggressive resuscitative and treatment approach was undertaken to allow confirmation that the liver lesions were melanoma and not a potentially treatable infection or lymphoma. An ultrasound guided transjugular biopsy of the liver was performed in the intensive care unit. Based on a frozen section diagnosis of malignant infiltration of the liver, high dose corticosteroid therapy was commenced. The patient continued to deteriorate despite maximal physiologic support and palliative measures were instituted after discussion with the next-of-kin. He succumbed to his illness on day-4 of admission. Autopsy revealed >80% liver infiltration by melanoma (Figure ), a diagnosis verified by an immunohistochemical phenotype of S-100 and HMB-45 positive cells (Figure ).","[[46.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['left shoulder', 'right upper quadrant', 'right upper quadrant', 'liver', 'bile ducts', 'abdomen', 'respiratory', 'endotracheal', 'renal', 'Liver', 'renal', 'liver', 'liver', 'liver']","['malignant melanoma', 'lesion', 'melanoma', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'right upper quadrant pain', 'toxic', 'afebrile', 'unremarkable', 'tender right upper quadrant', 'hepatomegaly', 'leukocytosis', 'modestly elevated liver enzymes', 'elevated liver enzymes', 'lactic acidosis', 'hepatomegaly', 'infiltrative process', 'normal bile ducts', 'respiratory failure', 'oliguria', 'hypotension', 'multi-system organ failure', 'anuria', 'azotemia', 'Liver failure', 'coagulopathy', 'transaminitis', 'hyperbilirubinema', 'distributive shock', 'biochemical derangements', 'hyperkalemia', 'acidosis', 'hyperphosphatemia', 'hyperuricemia', 'hypocalcemia', 'hyperkalemia', 'acidosis', 'liver lesions', 'melanoma', 'infection', 'lymphoma', 'malignant infiltration of the liver', 'continued to deteriorate', 'deteriorate', 'succumbed to his illness', 'liver infiltration by melanoma', 'immunohistochemical phenotype']",[],"['46-year', 'intensive care unit']","['medications', 'resection of a mole under local anesthetic', 'resection', 'metastatic work-up', 'physical examination', 'Laboratory', 'liver enzymes', 'lactic', 'Computed tomography scanning', 'ultrasound', 'Baseline imaging of his abdomen', 'endotracheal intubation', 'mechanical ventilation', 'fluid resuscitation', 'renal replacement therapy', 'plasma infusions', 'maximal pressor support', 'Hemodialysis', 'renal replacement therapy', 'aggressive resuscitative', 'treatment', 'ultrasound guided transjugular biopsy', 'ultrasound guided transjugular biopsy of the liver', 'corticosteroid therapy', 'palliative measures', 'Autopsy', 'immunohistochemical phenotype', 'HMB-45']","['On day two', 'day-4 of admission']"

He was evaluated in another center and was given the diagnosis of ascites associated with cirrhosis.
His past medical history was significant due to acute myocardial infarction in 1974, mild asthma and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Since his last evaluation, he has been receiving diltiazem 180 mg/day, aspirin 100 mg/day, digoxin 0,750 mg/week and spironalactone 50 mg/day. He is asymptomatic and walks 2000–3000 meters a day without angor or dyspnea.
The physical examination shows moderate abdominal distension, with no hepatosplenomegaly or edema, and there is mild jugular vein distension (1/3). The hepatojugular reflux was negative. His blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, pulse 70/ min and regular. The cardiac auscultation is normal and his lungs are clear. His current weight is 78.8 kg. One year before this admission he weighted 70 kg and before starting diuretics he was weighting 81 kg.
The blood laboratory was normal, except for a slightly increase in gamma-glutamyltransferase and 5'nucleotidase (Table ). A paracentesis was performed which showed a milky fluid with a high albumin gradient showing portal hypertension (Table ), all cultures and cytological studies were negative. Other studies showed normal iron values; antiHIV, HBsAg, antiHBs, antiHBc IgM and antiHCV negative, antiHBc IgG positive; ANA, AMA, SMA y ANCA negative.
A helical CT scan of the abdomen showed mild hepatomegaly, mild enlargement of caudate lobe and ascites. An upper endoscopy ruled out esophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy. A Doppler ultrasound showed a patent portal vein, with a normal diameter (6.6 mm) without alterations in the flow. A cardiac ultrasound showed moderate to severe systolic left ventricle dysfunction with global hypokinesia and the inferolateral wall was akinesic. The left ventricle diameters were normal and the left atria was enlarged (52 mm). The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 35%. There were no relevant valve signs, nor mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, nor pericardial disease.
A liver biopsy showed engrossment of centrilobular veins walls and fibrosis, with centrilobular hemorrhage and marked sinusoidal dilatation in acinar zone 3, suggesting increased intrahepatic venous pressure. An angiogram showed dilated but patent suprahepatic and portal veins and inferior vena cava, with slow flow. The measure of free suprahepatic, wedge suprahepatic, pulmonary capillary wedge, pulmonary artery, right ventricle and right atrial pressures confirmed the diagnosis of portal hypertension related to heart failure (Table ). He began treatment with furosemide 40 mg/day and spironalactone 100 mg/day; he continued treatment with aspirin, digoxin and diltiazem. The patient lost 8 kg and the abdominal distension was resolved approximately 2 month after the beginning of the treatment.

Clinical FNAC of this mass was performed (using a 23 gauge needle and 10 cc syringe) yielding 5 cc of straw-coloured fluid. Subsequently the patient had digital mammography. Thereafter, she complained of a difficulty in breathing and a subsequent chest X ray confirmed the presence of left-sided pneumothorax (Figures , ) which treated with per-cutaneous aspiration. The patient was admitted overnight for observation and a follow up chest X-ray showed resolution of the pneumothorax. The post-procedure mammogram showed an area of architectural distortion and irregularity in the medial aspect of the left breast which was regarded as suspicious. Three days later, this was subjected to an ultrasound guided core biopsy of the lesion and histology showed severe atypical hyperplasia. Ultrasound guided excision of the lesion was performed and the final histology showed radial scar, a 7 mm grade I infiltrating ductal carcinoma associated with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The surgical margins were clear. The patient subsequently had a sentinel node biopsy using the dual localization technique under local anaesthesia.

At the age of 18, he had suffered from painful oral and genital ulcerations and polyarthralgias. At that time, examination revealed bilateral papillary oedema and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed superior sagittal and left lateral thromboses. The patient was given oral prednisone at the dose of 1 mg/kg/day that was tapered gradually and colchicine 1 mg/day in addition to acenocoumarol to maintain International Normalized Ratio between 2 and 3. These medications were discontinued per the patient 7 months later which resulted in the recurrence of aphtous ulcerations and papulopustular eruptions episodes.
On physical examination the patient had fever, face and neck oedema, prominent superficial thoracic venous collaterals, and pseudofolliculitis lesions. There was evidence of penile and scrotal scarring and minor aphthae on the buccal mucosa. Blood pressure was 110/80 mm Hg and pulse rate 100/min.
As to laboratory tests, haemoglobin concentration was of 9 g/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 60 mm/hr and C reactive protein concentration of 19 mg/l (normal < 2 mg/l). Renal and liver function tests were normal. Levels of serum IgG and IgM anticardiolipin, protein C, protein S, antithrombine III and total homocysteine were within the normal range. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm tachycardia with no other abnormalities. Chest X-ray demonstrated hilar enlargement. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography showed multiple cardiac masses, one in the right atrium protruding through the tricuspid valve and two in the right ventricle (Figure – see Additional file 1). Helical computed tomography (CT) showed multiple thrombi in both right atrium and ventricle extending into the superior vena cava. There was innominate and brachiocephalic vein occlusion, it also showed bilateral pulmonary embolism and multiple pulmonary infarcts in the lower lobe of the lungs.

They both asked to be treated for heroin addiction. Before admission they had been treated once as out-patients without success. He first used heroin a year later, in 1995, intravenously from the start, beginning with half a gram once a week; six months later his dose had increased to a gram a day. By then he was shooting up daily. He had never had any physical illness. Once he was hospitalized because of overdose, although opiate antagonist medication was not necessary. The concentration in the blood of morphine, the catabolite of heroin, was 0.05 mg/l. At the time of admission no internal medicine or neurological disorder could be found, while dysthymia and emotional lability were observed in the psychiatric state without psychotic symptoms or disorientation. Laboratory tests showed no abnormality. Detoxification with clonidine was followed by rapid relapse. He was never abstinent for longer than a week.
His wife recounted that on January 8, 1999, the day before his death, they had decided to begin withdrawal the following day. Next day, January 9, the wife remained at home and K.J. set out for work. What happened after that can be reconstructed from the forensic medical report and from information given by drug-using friends. On the way to work K.J. changed his mind and, breaking his promise to his wife, went to the dealer and bought a dose of heroin. He met other drug-using friends there who had bought heroin from the same dealer that day and later told the author that the heroin purchased then did not differ in quality from the usual. K.J. did not return home with the heroin purchased as he did on other occasions but went to the public toilet in the pedestrian underpass at the Népliget Metro station where he injected the same quantity (0.5 gram) that he had taken the previous day in the accustomed place, at home with his wife. The authorities called out were unable to help and pronounced him dead. A syringe half filled with a yellowish-brown fluid and a sooty spoon were found beside the body. The fluid in the syringe was heroin, while the metabolite of heroin, 6-0-acetylmorphine, and morphine-3-0-glucuronid were found in the blood and urine.
The autopsy found numerous traces of punctures by injection needles of various age on both upper limbs, the left side of the neck and the lower limbs. Traces of an infected but healing needle puncture were found inside the right elbow. Examination of the internal organs showed signs of general, very acute circulatory failure: acute congestive plethora of the organs, cerebral oedema, heightened brain pressure, cerebellar inclusion, acutely inflated lungs. The concentration in the blood of morphine, the catabolite of heroin, was 0.05 mg/l. The dose did not differ from the accustomed, daily dose. Other substances (alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates) were not found.

The abdominal swelling started as a small lump but markedly increased in size in the preceding 3 months. It was associated with pain, severe epigastric discomfort, constipation, weakness and swelling of the legs.
The patient was ill-looking, clinically pale and had bilateral pitting pedal edema. The pulse rate was 80 beats per minute and the blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. The respiratory rate was 24 cycles per minute. The abdomen was grossly distended and tense. There was a massive central abdomino-pelvic mass which was firm and irregular, measuring 40 cm from the symphysis pubis.
Abdominal sonography showed an intra-uterine viable singleton fetus of 20 weeks gestation. It also showed a 30 cm multi-loculated cystic tumor with a thick capsule located at the right posterior-superior aspect of the uterus and free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. A sonographic diagnosis of ovarian tumor in pregnancy was made.
Blood tests showed a hematocrit of 22%, and normal electrolytes, urea and creatinin levels. The woman's blood group was 0 Rhesus positive and the hemoglobin genotype was AA. Malaria treatment was started following a positive smear test and two units of sedimented cells were administered to correct the anaemia. Because of the severity of the symptoms and the sonographic findings being suspicious of malignancy, surgery was proposed and discussed with the patient. Laparotomy was performed under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Operative findings included ascites, normal liver, spleen, kidneys, diaphragm, ovaries and fallopian tubes. The uterus was soft and the size was adequate for 20 weeks of gestation. Fetal movements were visible. A cystic subserosal fibroid measuring 32 cm in diameter was situated at the right posterior superior aspect of the uterus. [Fig ]
The subserosal fibroid was adherent to the omentum and the anterior abdominal wall. It was removed and the myoma bed was quickly closed with 2-0 polyglactin suture and hemostasis was easily achieved. The estimated blood loss was 600 mls and 2 units of whole blood were transfused intra-operatively. The tumor weighing 7.7 kg was sent for histology.
Intravenous magnesium sulphate was administered to prevent uterine contractions and the woman had an uneventful post-operative follow up.

Three months before she had received, at a different Institution, the echocardiographic diagnosis of moderate aortic and apparently trivial mitral stenosis, despite severe valve calcification, with mild LV hypertrophy (wall thickness was 13 mm) and good systolic function. A pharmacological regimen, consisting in enalapril and furosemide, both 20 mg a day, had been established; despite medical therapy she kept complaining of effort dyspnea. ECG (figure ) had revealed a first degree AV block, PR interval measuring 290 milliseconds, with normal QRS duration.
She underwent left and right cardiac catheterization with trans-septal access to the left atrium. Coronary arteries and regional LV systolic function were angiographically normal. LV ejection fraction was 0.65, cardiac index was 2.6 L/min/m2 and aortic and pulmonary systolic pressure were 130 and 38 mmHg, respectively. Aortic stenosis was confirmed to be moderate (the ventricle-to-aorta gradient was 50 mmHg at catheter pullback and aortic valve area was calculated to be 1.0 cm2). At fluoroscopy the mitral annulus was heavily calcified, but there was no hemodynamic evidence of mitral stenosis. With the trans-septal technique, moreover, we demonstrated (figure ) that atrial contraction prematurely occurred soon after mitral valve opening, as shown on the left atrial tracing by the (corresponding to atrial systole) falling very close to the preceding (corresponding to early-diastolic unloading of the atrium into the ventricle). The high and prominent consequently represented marked pressure elevation and reduced compliance of both left atrium and ventricle. Furthermore, LV filling pressure was as increased by the preceding atrial contraction as to cause a 6-mmHg end-diastolic ventriculo-atrial gradient that was evident, at the time of the R wave on the ECG, between the (corresponding to the atrial relaxation not followed by a properly timed ventricular contraction) and the LV pressure tracing.
We discussed with the patient the therapeutic options []: she preferred to defer aortic valve replacement, whereas accepted to undergo permanent pacing. We performed an echocardiographic evaluation of systolic and diastolic function before pacemaker implantation (Table ). Of note, the functional deterioration could be explained by the evidence of a grade II diastolic dysfunction[]: transmitral flow was showing a high-velocity (150 cm/s) single filling wave with a deceleration time of 155 ms. Dual-chamber pacemaker implantation with optimal restoration of AV synchrony (programmed AV delay 150 ms) resulted in clinical improvement up to NYHA class II on the same medications. Since both sinus node function and atrial sensing were satisfying, ventricular pacing was triggered by P wave with a QRS duration of 120 ms [-]. The echocardiographic evaluation 2 days after pacemaker implantation showed a reduction of both diastolic dysfunction[] to grade I (pattern of abnormal relaxation with an E/A ratio of 0.6) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure to 28 mmHg, whereas cardiac output appeared to be slightly improved (Table ) despite the depletive effect of furosemide could have kept the systolic performance lower than expected in such a hypertrophied, non-enlarged left ventricle with aortic stenosis. The patient is now under close echocardiographic monitoring for the optimal timing of aortic valve replacement.","[[72.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['heart', 'aortic', 'mitral', 'valve', 'LV', 'wall', 'AV', 'left and right cardiac', 'trans-septal', 'left atrium', 'Coronary arteries', 'regional LV', 'LV', 'LV', 'cardiac', 'aortic', 'pulmonary', 'Aortic', 'ventricle-to-aorta', 'aortic valve area', 'mitral annulus', 'mitral', 'atrial', 'mitral valve', 'left atrial', 'atrial', 'atrium', 'ventricle', 'both left atrium', 'ventricle', 'LV', 'atrial', 'ventriculo-atrial', 'atrial', 'ventricular', 'LV', 'aortic valve', 'AV', 'AV', 'ventricular', 'pulmonary artery', 'cardiac', 'left ventricle', 'aortic', 'aortic valve']","['heart failure symptoms', 'mitral stenosis', 'valve calcification', 'LV hypertrophy', 'good systolic function', 'effort dyspnea', 'AV block', 'normal QRS duration', 'Coronary arteries and regional LV systolic function were angiographically normal', 'regional LV systolic function were angiographically normal', 'Aortic stenosis', 'calcified', 'mitral stenosis', 'atrial contraction prematurely', 'mitral valve opening', 'left atrial tracing', 'atrial systole', 'early-diastolic unloading of the atrium', 'early-diastolic unloading of the atrium into the ventricle', 'pressure elevation', 'compliance', 'LV filling pressure was as increased', 'atrial contraction', 'end-diastolic ventriculo-atrial gradient', 'R wave', 'atrial relaxation', 'ventricular contraction', 'LV pressure tracing', 'diastolic function', 'functional deterioration', 'diastolic dysfunction', 'transmitral flow', 'optimal restoration of AV synchrony', 'clinical improvement', 'ventricular pacing was triggered by P wave', 'diastolic dysfunction', 'pattern of abnormal relaxation', 'depletive effect', 'systolic performance lower', 'hypertrophied', 'non-enlarged left ventricle', 'aortic stenosis']","['enalapril', 'furosemide', 'furosemide']",['72'],"['echocardiographic', 'wall thickness', 'pharmacological regimen', 'medical therapy', 'ECG', 'PR interval', 'left and right cardiac catheterization', 'trans-septal access to the left atrium', 'LV ejection fraction', 'cardiac index', 'aortic and pulmonary systolic pressure', 'ventricle-to-aorta gradient', 'fluoroscopy', 'ECG', 'aortic valve replacement', 'permanent pacing', 'echocardiographic evaluation of systolic and diastolic function', 'pacemaker implantation', 'deceleration time', 'Dual-chamber pacemaker implantation', 'Dual-chamber pacemaker implantation with optimal restoration of AV synchrony', 'programmed AV delay', 'medications', 'QRS duration', 'echocardiographic evaluation', 'pacemaker implantation', 'E/A ratio', 'pulmonary artery systolic pressure', 'cardiac output', 'echocardiographic monitoring', 'aortic valve replacement']",['2 days']

He underwent optical penetrating keratoplasty with extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation under local anesthesia in left eye. The post-operative period was uneventful and at last follow-up his vision in the left eye was 20/400.
Four patients in this series had presented as ulcerative keratitis and one as post-traumatic corneal ectasia. Two of the four patients, diagnosed as stromal keratitis, underwent deep stromal scrapings, which demonstrated microsporidial spores. The diagnosis was made on observing oval refractile bodies in the corneal scrapings, both within cells as well as in extracellular location. The Gram (figure ) and Giemsa stained smears revealed variable staining of the parasites. The oval body had a dark polar nucleus. The parasite was acid fast and appeared as red oval structure on smears stained with 1% acid fast stain (figure ). Corneal scrapings stained with calcofluor white showed oval fluorescent bodies in clumps. Bacterial and fungal cultures from these cases did not reveal any organisms except in one case (case 4) that showed a significant growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Three cases were initially treated medically based on the findings of smear examination.

There was no associated lymphadenopathy and an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathological and immunoistochemical features revealed a Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) but as the excision was incomplete the patient was sheduled for a wider excision in the following 2 months. In the meantime, the lesion recurred and the patient returned with a protruding white lesion of 1.1 cm in diameter. There was no associated lynphadenopathy and a wider excision, with an 8 mm margin, was performed. Histopathology confirmed the nature of MCC and the second excision was within healthy margins.
Two months later, the patient was referred to the Depatment of Plastic Surgery, for another protruding ulcerated lesion, 3 cm in diameter, on his lower lip (Fig ). On examination, multiple palpable lymph nodes in the submandibular and cervical area (superficial and deep cervical lymphadenopathy) were present.
Past medical history revealed that 8 years earlier, the patient had been diagnosed as having chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), (nodular and intermediate type), but he didn't receive any treatment. CT scan of the head and neck area, showed a soft tissue lobular mass, 3 cm in diameter, on the lower lip, with a possible extension to the mandible. The past medical history of CLL with the recent occurence of MCC posed a problem in the differential diagnosis of the patient's lymphadenopathy. A W-excision (4 × 3.5 × 1 cm) of the lip lesion was performed, with an open biopsy of one submandibular lymph node.
Histopathology, confirmed recurrence of MCC. An undifferentiated small cell carcinoma with hyaluronated stroma was identified. The cells arranged in nodules or rosettes, had dense nuclear chromatin, with mitoses and nuclear debris which are regular features of MCC (Fig. , ).
Immunoistochemical procedures showed Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) positivity, while antibodies for Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) and Chromogranin were negative. The excision was described as complete. The submandibular lymph node was positive for malignacy but was associated with the CLL (non Hodgkin's, B cell small lymhocytic lymphoma). There was no evidence of metastatic infiltration by MCC and this was confirmed immunoistochemically with the positive expression of CD5 and CD20 antibody and negative expression of CD10 antibody and NSE. Due to the age of the patient, chemotherapy was not considered.
A month later, a new CT scan of the head and neck, depicted a soft tissue mass, consistent with recurrence of MCC, between the left angle of the mandible and the hyoid bone. Multiple enlarged superficial and deep cervical lymph nodes were present. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the submandibular swelling was performed and confirmed MCC (small atypical cells were found, isolated or forming rosettes and exhibited dense core granules of chromatin and scanty cytoplasm). The patient underwent one month of neck radiotherapy with Cobalt 60, a total dose of 4600cGy in 23 days. A further boost of 600cGy in 2 days, on the left submandibular area was administered.
The treatment was successfully completed with full remission of the cervical lymphadenopathy. Two months following the radiotherapy, a new CT scan of the head and neck showed reduction and obscurrence of the pre-existing mass on the left mandibular area, while the lymph nodes were smaller too.

The patient underwent surgical resection with subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-proven complete excision.
In the context of a clinical trial, exploring the role of high-dose chemo-radiotherapy in malignant glioma, the patient underwent high dose sequential chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide 7 g/m2 plus rhG-CSF (5 μg/kbw) and hematopoietic cells harvest, followed by methotrexate 8 g/m2 and thiotepa 900 mg/m2. Autologous unfractionated hematopoietic stem cells were administered at doses of 7.5 × 106/kg CD34+ cells and the patient experienced an uncomplicated hematological recovery within 10 days.
One month later, the patient received 70-Gy of fractioned whole-brain irradiation, and steroids (dexamethasone 8 mg i.v. bid) were administered for 2 months and than tapered at the end of radiotherapy.
On day +105 he was hospitalized because of the occurrence of right hilum lymphoadenopathy associated with cutaneous lesions, as limited erythematous plaques, with well-demarcated margins and scalings.
Surgical nodes and skin excision showed the presence of HD, nodular sclerosis type, with atypical HD-like elements, infiltrating the skin. The staging evaluation, performed by CT scan of abdomen and thorax and bone marrow biopsy, was negative for distant involvement (stage IA) and no treatment was administered after radical surgery.
Eight months after HSCT, the malignant glioma relapsed and the patient received 2 cycles of carmustine (240 mg/m2 i.v. q.6 weeks) without clinical benefit, followed by palliative neurosurgical subtotal excision. The steroids treatment was resumed (dexamethasone 4 mg, daily) and chronically administered as supportive care.
Six months later, histological-confirmed HD relapse occurred as bilateral hilum lymphoadenopaty. Because of deteriorated neurological clinical conditions, the patient declined any further treatment and died 2 months later for progressive glioma.
Lymph node and skin biopsies were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. Micron sections were then prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Paraffin section immunohistochemical stains were performed using a biotin-streptavidin technique. The lymph node structure and the skin biopsy were diffusely effaced by a growth consisting of polymorphic features of small T-cell-rich B cell lymphoma/HD-like, and typical Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg cells (HRSCs), nodular sclerosis type with limited areas of lymphocyte depletion (REAL) (Fig. and ). At immunohistochemistry, HRSCs expressed the following molecules: CD30+, CD43+, CD15+/-, CD3+/-; and were negative for EMA, ALK and CD20.
EBV latent membrane protein (LMP-1) was weakly positive at HRSCs immunohistochemistry, but EBV-DNA determination by PCR [] performed in multiple node biopsy fragments and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) yielded negative results.
According to the clinical, histological and immunohistochemical findings, HD consistent with non EBV-associated PTLD was diagnosed.","[[60.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['left parietal and temporal lobes', 'whole-brain', 'right hilum', 'hilum', 'cutaneous', 'Surgical nodes', 'skin', 'abdomen', 'thorax', 'bone marrow', 'radical', 'bilateral hilum', 'neurological', 'Lymph node', 'skin', 'lymph node structure', 'skin', 'multiple node']","['anaplastic astrocytoma', 'complete excision', 'malignant glioma', 'Autologous unfractionated hematopoietic stem cells', 'uncomplicated hematological recovery', 'right hilum lymphoadenopathy', 'hilum lymphoadenopathy', 'cutaneous lesions', 'erythematous plaques', 'well-demarcated margins', 'scalings', 'HD', 'nodular sclerosis type', 'HD-like elements', 'infiltrating the skin', 'distant involvement', 'malignant glioma', 'bilateral hilum lymphoadenopaty', 'deteriorated neurological clinical conditions', 'died', 'glioma', 'effaced', 'growth', 'polymorphic features', 'T-cell-rich B cell lymphoma/HD-like', ""Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg cells"", 'HRSCs', 'nodular sclerosis type', 'limited areas of lymphocyte depletion', 'HRSCs', 'EMA', 'ALK', 'CD20', 'PTLD']","['cyclophosphamide', 'rhG-CSF', 'methotrexate', 'thiotepa', 'dexamethasone', 'carmustine', 'dexamethasone', 'buffered formalin', 'formalin', 'paraffin', 'hematoxylin', 'eosin']",['60'],"['surgical resection', 'magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'chemo-radiotherapy', 'sequential chemotherapy', 'fractioned whole-brain irradiation', 'steroids', 'radiotherapy', 'skin excision', 'CT scan of abdomen and thorax', 'bone marrow biopsy', 'treatment', 'radical surgery', 'HSCT', 'palliative neurosurgical subtotal excision', 'steroids treatment', 'supportive care', 'histological', 'HD', 'treatment', 'biopsies', 'Micron sections were then prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin', 'Paraffin section immunohistochemical stains', 'skin biopsy', 'immunohistochemistry', 'HRSCs', 'CD30', 'CD43', 'CD15', 'CD3', 'EBV latent membrane protein', 'LMP-1', 'HRSCs immunohistochemistry', 'EBV-DNA determination by PCR', 'multiple node biopsy fragments', 'peripheral blood mononuclear cells', 'immunohistochemical', 'HD']","['within 10 days', 'One month later', 'Eight months', 'Six months later', '2 months later']"

His medical background included recent-onset hypertension and diabetes, and renal calculi. He takes lisinopril and glyburide, as well as doxepin and atarax when required. His past psoriasis treatments include topical steroids, methotrexate (not tolerated due to nausea), and UVB with minimal effect.
He was first seen at The Rockefeller University, NY, USA, in December 2000 and received numerous courses of biological therapies in the context of our clinical trials program. He initially received efalizumab (100 mg [1 mg/kg] sc weekly for 12 weeks) with good effect. His re-treatment with efalizumab was required in May 2001 because of a sunburn-induced flare, and was permitted under our clinical trial protocol. Another psoaisis flare in Sept 2001 was treated with alefacept (7.5 mg IV for 12 weekly doses) with good effect. Subsequent disease exacerbations were managed well with a course of daclizumab (anti-CD25) therapy, NB-UVB, and cyclosporine.
Due to previous success with efalizumab and recent USA FDA approval, a disease flare in March 2004 was managed with efalizumab at the standard dose (1 mg/kg/wk sc) at a private clinic. However, he missed a dose in June 2004 and his skin flared again, so he re-attended our clinic (Fig ). Despite missing a dose, there was still leukocyte CD11a saturation by efalizumab (Fig. , solid line identical to isotype, shaded). At this time, his psoriasis was complicated by Staphlococcal skin infection. To gain control of his skin disease and while waiting for his skin infection to respond to antibiotic treatment (dicloxicillin), he was given low-dose NB-UVB. Efalizumab was re-commenced in September 2004 with good result (110 mg/wk, 1 mg/kg). This has been continued and the patient is currently in remission.
Immunohistochemistry during the flare reaction (Fig. ), shows there are relatively less lesional CD3+ cells compared to untreated psoriasis, and they are predominantly all CD8+. CD103 is also expressed on epidermal T cells. In addition, there are abundant CD11c+ and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)+ inflammatory cells infiltrating the dermis and epidermis. CD14+ cells are relatively rare (not shown).","[[51.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['renal', 'skin', 'skin', 'skin', 'skin', 'epidermal T cells', 'dermis', 'epidermis']","['plaque psoriasis', 'psoriasis', 'hypertension', 'diabetes', 'renal calculi', 'psoriasis', 'nausea', 'UVB', 'minimal effect', 'sunburn-induced flare', 'psoaisis flare', 'good effect', 'disease exacerbations', 'disease flare', 'skin flared', 'psoriasis', 'Staphlococcal skin infection', 'skin disease', 'skin infection', 'remission', 'flare reaction', 'lesional CD3+ cells', 'psoriasis', 'CD8+', 'CD103 is also expressed on epidermal T cells', 'CD11c+', 'inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)+ inflammatory cells infiltrating the dermis and epidermis', 'inflammatory cells infiltrating', 'CD14+ cells']","['lisinopril', 'glyburide', 'doxepin', 'atarax', 'methotrexate', 'efalizumab', 'efalizumab', 'alefacept', 'daclizumab', 'cyclosporine', 'efalizumab', 'efalizumab', 'efalizumab', 'dicloxicillin', 'Efalizumab']","['1', '51', 'Ecuador', 'The Rockefeller University, NY, USA', 'December 2000', 'May 2001', 'Sept 2001', 'March 2004', 'private clinic', 'June 2004', 'September 2004']","['steroids', 'UVB', 'biological therapies', 'anti-CD25', 'NB-UVB', 'leukocyte CD11a saturation', 'antibiotic treatment', 'NB-UVB', 'remission', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'CD103']","['15 years', 'recent-onset', 'recent-onset', 'recent-onset', 'May 2001', 'Sept 2001', 'March 2004', 'At this time', 'September 2004', 'currently', 'currently']"

Her first presentation of psoriasis was with erythroderma at 19 years old. Her past medical history included appendicectomy, infectious mononucleosis, and Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria at age 15 years following travel to Papua New Guinea. She was not taking any medications at the time of initial referral to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Department of Dermatology, New South Wales, Australia, in 1994.
Past rotational treatments for her psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis included cyclosporine (1990 and 1995), methotrexate (1993 and 1996), acitretin (1994 and 1997), as well as periodic courses of NB-UVB. She was hospitalized in 1999 for erythrodermic psoriasis. In 2001 her psoriasis flared and other therapies tried without success were mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxyurea, tacrolimus, and thioguanine. From July 2001 to November 2002 she received periodic treatment with cyclosporine and acitretin therapy, with poor disease control.
Over the next 2.5 years, this patient was treated with a number of newer biological therapies with standard dosing, sometimes requiring cyclosporine cover and subsequent withdrawal as the patient responded. Etanercept (anti-TNF receptor) (Dec 2002–Feb 2003, 25 mg sc twice week) was initially successful, but was ceased on relapse to erythroderma. Alefacept (anti-CD2) (15 mg IM weekly for 3 months) had no beneficial effect.
Efalizumab (anti-CD11a) (80 mg [1 mg/kg] sc weekly, Dec 2003) induced a dramatic clinical response, and after 6 weeks, cyclosporine was ceased. The patient missed the 18th dose of efalizumab, but the regular dose was given at the subsequent visit. Two days after the ""catchup"" dose, the patient developed a psoriatic flare involving extensive plaques on all body surfaces. Immunohistochemistry at this time (Fig. ) shows similar results to patient 1: there are relatively reduced CD3+ and CD8+ cells, epidermal T cells are CD103+, and there are abundant CD11c+ and iNOS+ inflammatory cells infiltrating the dermis and epidermis.
During this flare, NB-UVB was administered concomitantly with efalizumab, however a UVB-induced burn was associated with recurrence of her psoriasis. However, by June 2004 there was almost confluent severe plaque psoriasis again with features of erythroderma. The efalizumab dose was increased to 125 mg (1.5 mg/kg) sc weekly, but was ceased in Sept 2004 as there was no further improvement.
Infliximab (anti-TNF-α) (400 mg [5 mg/kg] at 0 and 2 weeks, followed by 400 mg every 6 weeks) was commenced with excellent effect for 4 months, when the patient then experienced another flare of her psoriasis. It was decided to carefully combine infliximab and efalizumab therapy. In February 2005, 62.5 mg (0.7 mg/kg) efalizumab was given sc, and a second dose of 125 mg (1.4 mg/kg) a week later, and she started to respond clinically.

This was associated with headache and pain on ocular movements. There was a history of being bitten by a stray dog 8 days before the visual symptoms, and the patient had received three injections of chick embryo cell anti-rabies vaccine (Rabipur, Hoeshst Marion Roussel) on day 0, 3 and 7 after the dog bite. He developed these symptoms after the third injection. There was no history of any other ocular or systemic problems.
The general physical examination was within normal limits. The best-corrected visual acuity was 6/60 in the right and 6/24 in the left eye. IOP was 16 mm of Hg by applanation tonometry. Anterior segment examination using slitlamp was normal. Fundoscopy using + 90 D revealed hyperemic optic disc with blurred margins and disc edema. Vessels were tortuous and macular star was present in the nasal part of macula of both the eyes (Fig ). Pupils were sluggishly reacting in both the eyes. Goldmann perimetry revealed centrocaecal scotoma in both eyes which was more dense in the right eye as compared to the left.
The routine blood investigations were all within normal limits. The aerobic and aerobic cultures were sterile. The VDRL test and indirect haemagglutination test for syphillis and toxoplasmosis were normal. Serology for bartonella was negative. Mantoux test showed a reading of 8 mm. and the chest X-ray was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain and optic nerves revealed slight signal enhancement of both the optic nerves with slight increase in optic nerve thickness on axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. No other significant abnormality was seen in MRI of brain.
A diagnosis of bilateral neuroretinitis was made. As the dog which had bitten the patient was kept under observation and was alive after one week, further injections of antirabies vaccine were stopped. The patient was given three doses of pulse dexamethasone 100 mg in 150 ml of 5% dextrose. The visual acuity improved to 6/6 in both the eyes over the next two weeks.

During the physical examination, he was found to have low blood pressure (90/60 mmHg), sinusal tachycardia and gallop rhythm. An olosistolic murmur was heard in the mitral area. Rales were available on pulmonary auscultation. The electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm and left ventricular hypertrophy (Fig. ).
Chest x-ray showed left atrial and ventricular enlargement; alveolar edema in the hilar regions of both lung fields.
The echocardiogram (TTE) showed left ventricular enlargment, atrial dilatation, moderate/severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic regurgitation; mitral valve masses were suspected.
Based on this diagnosis, the patient underwent a transesophageal-echo (TEE).
TEE showed, on apical 4-chamber section, an anulare structure attached from a membrane to the atrial wall anterior mitral valve leaflet and just proximal to the posterior mitral leaflet (Fig. , ).
This supravalvular ring was proximal to the left atrial appendage, in contradistinction to ""cor triatriatum""; it restricted the leaflets movement and impaired their opening. A severe mitral regurgitation (IV grade PISA) and mild diastolic gradient (6 mm/Hg DP mean) was detected by the Doppler-echocardiography (see ).
A moderate/severe aortic regurgitation was seen. Mitral vegetations were not identified. Coronary angiography was normal; left cineventriculography showed a severe aortic and mitral regurgitation, but a mitral supravalvular structure was not noticed.
Based on TEE diagnosis, the patient underwent surgery in November 2002.
A left atriotomy enabled the identification of a membrane right above the mitral valve with 2 small openings that allowed blood to flow from the atrium to the left ventricle. The membrane was excised and the mitral and aortic valves were replaced. Follow up: after 6 month, the patient was in I NYHA class.

Lymphatic drainage was detected to both inguinal basins and both excised sentinel lymph nodes were unaffected. None of the staging examinations including computer tomography (CT) of the brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis, as well as lymph node sonography revealed any signs of tumor manifestation. The medical history of the patient was otherwise unremarkable and she was not on any medication. There was no family history of hypertension, heart disease or pulmonary disease. Because of the high-risk nature of the melanoma, the patient started long-term adjuvant therapy with IFN α2b (5 × 10 million U. s.c. per week for 4 weeks followed by 3 × 10 million U. s.c. per week).
After 30 months of IFN α2b treatment the patient reported increasing dyspnea on exertion and afebrile non-productive coughing accompanied by sudden malaise and edema of the lower legs. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia (120 /min) and right axis deviation. A chest x-ray showed signs of right ventricular dilatation and pleural effusion on the right side; no pneumonic infiltrates were seen. Abdominal sonography revealed a significant amount of ascites. The patient was diagnosed with decompensated right heart failure and was therefore hospitalized. Initial investigations with transthoracic echocardiography showed right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation (Figure ), PAH with a calculated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPsyst) of 80 mmHg and tricuspid insufficiency grade II-III with morphologically normal valves (Figure ), a reduced right ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, a hypokinetic right ventricle and pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade. Laboratory work-up showed slightly increased levels of d-dimers and liver enzymes, while inflammatory markers were within the normal range. There were no signs of vasculitis, hypercoagulability or rheumatologic disorders. A high-resolution CT of the chest revealed no signs of pulmonary embolism, alveolar or interstitial lung diseases, but signs of PAH with a widened central pulmonary artery (40 mm), right ventricular dilatation (> 80 mm), regurgitation of contrast medium into liver veins, a circular pericardial effusion and a 300–400 ml pleural effusion of the right side.
Diagnostic right heart catheter revealed a PAPmean of 56 mmHg (PAPsyst 87 mmHg), a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 1.128 dyn × sec × cm-5, an impaired cardiac index and a 3 fold increased total peripheral resistance. Testing of pulmonary vasoreactivity showed a reduction of PAPmean from 56 mmHg to 26 mmHg with the PDE-5-inhibitor sildenafil (Table ).
Therefore, treatment with 3 × 25 mg sildenafil per day was initiated. No side effects occurred. After one month, tricuspid insufficiency improved to grade I-II. After six months right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation were reduced. Because of the 2 documented cases of patients with PAH due to therapy with IFNα2 where PAH was reversible half a year after termination of IFNα2 [,] we attempted to terminate sildenafil under control of hemodynamic monitoring. PAPmean increased promptly to 57 mmHg. In this context we could verify the same effectiveness for therapy with vardenafil in comparison to sildenafil. Reduction of PVR was higher in vardenafil vs. sildenafil (Table ); therefore the therapy was switched from sildenafil to vardenafil 10 mg twice daily. 24 months after onset of PAH the patient felt fine and resumed working.

206,1208964-1,16135256,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1208964.xml,Varicella zoster virus acute retinal necrosis following eye contusion: case report,"We present a case of a 51-year-old otherwise healthy man, who suffered from rapid visual loss in the left eye following contusion. Ocular trauma was caused during a football match by a ball, which hit an index finger located just in front of the bulbus. The patient attended our department on April 27, 2004, one week after the injury, when the vision in the left eye decreased to light perception with inaccurate light projection and hand movements in a lower part of visual field. The best-corrected visual acuity in the right eye was 1.0. Intraocular pressures were 18 mmHg in the right eye and 45 mmHg in the left eye. Examination of the anterior segment and fundus of the right eye revealed no pathology. The left eye showed discrete injection of the conjunctiva and keratic precipitates with mild anterior chamber flare and cells. There was iridodonesis, cleft syndrome and a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. The fundus examination of the left eye revealed swelling of the optic disc, large ischemic macular edema, superficial retinal hemorrhages, narrowing of the arterioles and dilatation of the venules (Figure ). Fluorescein angiography of the left eye showed macular edema and vascular leakage in the venous phase (Figure ). Duplex Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography scans of the brain and orbits were normal.
Based on the clinical findings, the presumed diagnosis of ocular ischemic syndrome was made. The patient was initially treated with vaso-active drugs in addition to corticosteroids. Intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg daily for 5 days) followed by 60 mg of oral prednisone daily was indicated due to swelling of the optic disc and macular edema. Despite intensive therapy, the fundus examination showed progression of ischemic lesions. Visual acuity in the left eye was light perception with inaccurate light projection. The finding on the right eye was without changes. The patient was discharged on oral prednisone 50 mg daily.
On May 24, 2004, four weeks after pulse intravenous corticosteroid treatment, vision in the initially uninvolved right eye decreased to 0.25. Fundus examination of the right eye disclosed swelling of the optic disc with hemorrhages, blurring of the optic disk margins and ischemic macular edema (Figure ). In the left eye, massive vitreous opacities made evaluation of the fundus impossible.
A differential diagnosis of antiphospholipide syndrome, masquerading syndrome, viral retinitis or specific inflammation was considered.
No neurological or other abnormalities were found on systemic examination. The findings from magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of brain and orbits were within normal limits. The cerebrospinal fluid was negative for VZV DNA and enteroviruses RNA. Chest X ray and abdominal ultrasonography were normal. Leukocyte count, hematocrit and activated partial tromboplastin time (APTT) were normal, liver tests showed elevated levels of alaninaminotranspherase (ALT; 2.63 ukat/l). Anti-cardiolipin antibodies were negative. Serologic tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1/-2) were negative. Serum was evaluated regarding evidence for herpesviruses by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Low levels of VZV and EBV EBNA-1 IgG antibodies were detected in serum, whereas IgM antibodies were absent; as well antibodies of respiratory infections or neuroinfections were negative. Blood cultures were also negative. Immunofenotypization showed lower count of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, without plasma cell neoplasia.
On May 27, 2004, an aqueous tap of the left eye was performed and samples were submitted for cytological and virological analysis. PCR of aqueous humour was negative for herpesviruses family and cytology confirmed non-purulent intraocular inflammation. The patient was treated with corticosteroids. The best-corrected visual acuity in the right eye decreased to 0.02. Due to progressive impairment of the clinical status, the corticosteroid therapy was stopped. Fundus examination demonstrated several enlarging foci of necrotizing retinitis with extensive posterior pole involvement (Figure ). Based on the clinical appearance, a diagnosis of presumed necrotizing herpetic retinopathy was made. The patient was commenced on high-dose intravenous acyclovir (4 × 500 mg per day for 2 weeks). Two days later, visual loss with acuity reduced to light perception with inaccurate light projection occurred in the right eye. In the left eye, there was progression of vitreous opacities and the vision was light perception with inaccurate light projection.
On June 4, 2004, a diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy and retinal biopsy were carried out in the left eye. The vitreous cavity was filled with 16% perfluoropropane (C3F8) gas. A part of retina and samples of diluted and undiluted vitreous were obtained. Due to failure of the antiviral treatment and ocular disease progression, the patient underwent a pars plana vitrectomy in the right eye on June 9, 2004.
PCR of retina of the left eye and undiluted vitreous of both eyes were positive for VZV. Undiluted vitreous was negative for HSV-1 and -2, CMV, EBV. PCR of diluted vitreous was negative for herpesviruses family. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not detected using PCR in vitreous of both eyes. Cultivation of vitreous for bacteria and fungi was negative; Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were also negative. Histopathological examination confirmed non-purulent intraocular inflammation. Immunofenotypization of vitreous of both eyes showed no plasma cell neoplasia.
In two weeks, intravenous acyclovir was followed by oral acyclovir (5 × 400 mg daily). In the right eye, large foci of retinal atrophy with reduced inflammatory reaction were present. Owing the cataract induced by gas, fundus of the left eye was not visible.
The patient was discharged on acyclovir 4 × 400 mg daily. However, an exudative retinal detachment was seen in the right eye and vision decreased to 0. Vision in the left eye was light perception with inaccurate light projection. On examination 4 weeks later, B-scan ultrasonography of the left eye confirmed the exudative retinal detachment. Nevertheless, despite intensive treatment with intravenous antiviral medication, the patient became completely blind in both eyes.","[[51.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['left eye', 'Ocular', 'index finger',

On admission her abdomen was slightly distended, tympanic, and slightly tender in the upper abdominal regions, with normal bowel sounds and no palpable mass. Blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 6,100/mm3, c reactive protein (CRP) 6.01 mg/dl, carcinoma antigen (CA) 19-9 50.6 mg/dl and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of 2.9 mg/dl. Pelvic computed tomography (CT) identified an abnormal thickness of the bladder wall with enhance effect in a diverticulum and it's origin from bladder (Figure. ). Another mass was seen in the antral portion of the stomach; however, pancreas and biliary tract were normal on computed tomography. There was not other lesion detected in other abdominal and pelvic organs.
A gastroscopy was carried out which revealed type 3 pyloric stenosis. A biopsy of the stomach was taken which revealed well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. Cystoscopy was performed which showed a lesion in the bladder diverticulum, a biopsy of the bladder wall revealed well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma metastasis from gastric carcinoma. At laparotomy, the pylorus segment of the stomach was viable with signs of edema, but no serosal invasion was identified. There were no sign of peritoneal dissemination in the intra-abdominal cavity. Peritoneal washings were negative for malignant cells. A palliative distal gastrectomy with gastrojejunostomy was performed to relieve pyloric obstruction.
However, cystectomy or diverticulectomy was not performed due to age of the patient and technical difficulties due to previous two surgeries performed for abnormal position of uterus and volvulus of intestine. The size of the macroscopic specimen was 3.0 × 2.5 cm (Figure. ). Histology revealed well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma invading to the muscularis propria (MP), 3type, Infiltrative growth pattern (inf) β, int, ly3, v0 (Figure. , ), Similar to that of bladder tumor (Figure ). The patient recovered with no further symptoms, and was discharged on the 19th postoperative day.

208,1208966-1,16137328,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1208966.xml,Pancreatic metastasis of Merkel cell carcinoma and concomitant insulinoma: Case report and literature review,"A 82-year old lady presented to the Department of General Surgery at the University of Heidelberg, Germany with recurrent attacks of hypoglycemia and a large abdominal mass. While diagnostic tests repeatedly documented glucose levels below 40 mg/dl (normal levels 80 – 120 mg/dl), a computed tomography (CT) (Figure ) scan of the abdomen revealed a large lesion of around 5 to 6 cm in relation to the pancreatic body and tail. There were also large masses of about 3–5 cm in the retroperitoneum and in the area of the celiac trunk and around the mesenteric artery. Furthermore, in the pancreatic body there was a hypervascularized area (Figure ), that was suspicious for an insulinoma. Clinically this lady, who was not thriving, reported a weight loss of 12 kilograms over the previous 4 months. A somatostatin receptor scintigraphy showed an enhanced uptake in the region of the pancreatic body/tail as well as in the right axilla (a palpable mass was also noted there) and excluded the possibility of other involved areas.
She gave a past history of an operation done on the right eyebrow 2 years prior for a 0.8 × 0.8 cm lesion (Figure ) that was reported as a Merkel cell carcinoma. Histopathology showed rather uniform tumor cells in a trabecular growth pattern (Figure ) with monomorphous pale-stained nuclei and many mitoses (Figure ). There was invasion of dermal lymphatics and blood vessels (Figure , insert). Immunohistochemistry revealed strong positivity for cytokeratin 20 (Figure ) and neurofilament (not shown) in the characteristic dot-like pattern and a weak expression of chromogranin A (Figure ). After excision, radiation therapy was also administered only at the site of the primary lesion, the draining lymphatic vessels and the first lymph node station. A year later, a large abdominal mass was noted of uncertain origin and an ultrasound guided biopsy showed an unspecified small cell cancer. In view of the large mass with additional suspicious areas being noted in the spleen, left adrenal gland and axilla, she had been subjected to palliative radiotherapy of 30 Gray over 2 months. However no definitive diagnosis of metastasis in these areas was established. With a working clinical diagnosis of symptomatic insulinoma not responding to medical measures, a decision for surgical resection of this large lesion was inevitable, the age of the patient and the previous history of palliative radiation just 6 months prior notwithstanding.
Surgical exploration revealed a large mass of about 5 cm in the tail of the pancreas, in close proximity to the spleen and the splenic flexure of the transverse colon. However there was no evidence of any metastatic disease to the liver, peritoneum and the adnexae. After a careful and meticulous mobilization, a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and adrenalectomy along with resection of the splenic flexure of the colon were performed.
Pathological examination revealed a tumor with manifestations in the pancreatic tail, the adrenal gland, the peripancreatic tissue, and the surrounding soft tissue. Grossly, the mass displayed a whitish and glassy cut surface, containing extended areas of haemorrhage and necrosis. Histologically, the tumor displayed endocrine architecture with mostly solid formations of rather monomorphic cells. The tumor was mitotically highly active (mitotic count >10 per high power field) and contained abundant areas of necrosis. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were strongly positive for the endocrine marker synaptophysin and for cytokeratin 20 while there was no expression of insulin. The proliferative activity (MIB-1) reached approximately 80% (Figure ).
Furthermore, gross examination of the resected specimen revealed a well demarcated, brownish tumor of the pancreatic body, measuring 1.2 cm in diameter. This tumor microscopically displayed endocrine architecture with trabecular arrangements of uniform tumor cells, showing no mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong positivity for synaptophysin as well as focal positivity for insulin. The proliferative activity (MIB-1) was approximately 1% (Figure ). The diagnosis of a poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma (Merkel cell carcinoma) along with that of benign pancreatic insulinoma was thus made.
The patient had a smooth postoperative recovery, the bouts of hypoglycaemia completely disappeared, and she was discharged home within 3 weeks of surgery. She is presently asymptomatic and remains on regular follow up.","[[82.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['abdominal', 'pancreatic body and tail', 'retroperitoneum', 'celiac trunk', 'around the mesenteric artery', 'pancreatic body', 'region of the pancreatic body/tail', 'body/tail', 'right axilla', 'right eyebrow', 'trabecular growth pattern', 'dermal lymphatics', 'blood vessels', 'site of the primary lesion', 'lymphatic vessels', 'first lymph node station', 'abdominal', 'small cell', 'spleen', 'left adrenal gland', 'axilla', 'tail of the pancreas', 'spleen', 'splenic flexure of the transverse colon', 'liver', 'peritoneum', 'adnexae', 'splenic flexure of the colon', 'pancreatic tail', 'adrenal gland', 'peripancreatic tissue', 'surrounding soft tissue', 'endocrine', 'pancreatic body', 'endocrine', 'endocrine architecture', 'trabecular', 'endocrine', 'pancreatic']","['attacks of hypoglycemia', 'abdominal mass', 'lesion', 'masses', 'hypervascularized area', 'insulinoma', 'thriving', 'weight loss', 'enhanced uptake', 'mass', 'lesion', 'Merkel cell carcinoma', 'tumor cells', 'monomorphous pale-stained nuclei', 'mitoses', 'invasion of dermal lymphatics', 'characteristic dot-like pattern', 'weak expression of chromogranin A', 'draining lymphatic vessels', 'abdominal mass', 'small cell cancer', 'mass', 'metastasis', 'insulinoma', 'lesion', 'mass', 'metastatic disease', 'tumor', 'mass', 'haemorrhage', 'necrosis', 'tumor', 'endocrine architecture', 'solid formations', 'monomorphic cells', 'tumor', 'necrosis', 'tumor cells', 'expression of insulin', 'proliferative activity', 'tumor of the pancreatic body', 'tumor', 'endocrine architecture', 'trabecular arrangements of uniform tumor cells', 'mitotic activity', 'proliferative activity', 'endocrine carcinoma', 'Merkel cell carcinoma', 'benign pancreatic insulinoma', 'smooth postoperative recovery', 'hypoglycaemia', 'asymptomatic']",['insulin'],"['82-year', 'Department of General Surgery', 'University of Heidelberg, Germany']","['diagnostic tests', 'somatostatin receptor scintigraphy', 'operation', 'Histopathology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'cytokeratin 20', 'neurofilament', 'excision', 'radiation therapy', 'ultrasound guided biopsy', 'palliative radiotherapy', 'medical measures', 'surgical resection of this large lesion', 'palliative radiation', 'Surgical exploration', 'careful and meticulous mobilization', 'distal pancreatectomy', 'splenectomy', 'adrenalectomy', 'resection of the splenic flexure of the colon', 'Pathological examination', 'mitotic count', 'Immunohistochemically', 'endocrine marker synaptophysin', 'cytokeratin 20', 'gross examination', 'resected specimen', 'tumor microscopically', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'synaptophysin', 'insulin', 'surgery']","['over the previous 4 months', '2 years prior', 'A year later', '6 months prior', '3 weeks', 'presently']"

She had severe lethargy and intermittent right upper abdominal discomfort without any significant loss in weight. Her past medical history included essential hypertension controlled on atenolol 100 mg once daily and was also on frusemide 40 mg once daily. She had no significant surgical history other than having undergone cholecystectomy in 1972. She had never smoked nor consumed alcohol. Physical examination showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Complete blood count showed normal haemoglobin concentration 14.8 g/dl, macrocytosis (MCV 100.1), raised white cell count at 13.4 × 109/L, lymphocytosis (absolute number 6.3 × 109/L), and normal neutrophil count (absolute number 5.6 × 109/L). Peripheral blood showed numerous Howell-Jolly bodies within erythrocytes. Thyroid function tests, protein electrophoresis, C-reactive protein, immunoglobulin levels and autoimmune screening were normal. Ultrasonography and computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not reveal retroperitoneal or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, but the spleen was noted to be very atrophic. Gastroscopy showed multiple gastric erosions and the initial impression was of celiac disease complicated by lymphoma and lymphocytosis.
Duodenal biopsy showed well-formed villi and no increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes thereby excluding celiac disease. Colonoscopy and barium studies were normal. She was clinically diagnosed to have functional hyposplenism, considering the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies, and was given hemophilus influenzae (HiB) vaccine, pneumovax vaccine and counselled for long term oral Penicillin V. In November 1994, another complete blood count showed a white cell count of 15.3 × 109/L with absolute number of lymphocytes of 6.6 × 109/L. Bone marrow biopsy showed 25% infiltration with large granular lymphocytes. Peripheral blood smear revealed that the majority of lymphocytes had atypical morphology with large atypical nuclei and abundant cytoplasm containing fine azurophilic granules. Immunophenotyping showed CD16+/CD3- cells which were mainly reactive and another clonal cells which were CD57+/CD8+ suggesting NK-LGL (Natural Killer-Large Granular Lymphocyte) activity. 80% CD3+ cells were α/β and 20% γ/δ and a clonal population of CD16+/CD56+ cells.
She presented in March 1995 with lethargy and diffuse enlargement of her thyroid gland.

On examination, a vague mass was palpable in the left lumbar region. The patient had history of excision of bilateral ovarian cystic masses for cystic teratoma twelve years earlier. Computerized tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a 9 × 7 cm uniformly solid mass with poor contrast enhancement situated in the inferomedial aspect of the left kidney [Fig ]. It was difficult to determine whether the mass was arising from renal parenchyma or renal pelvis. There were no retroperitoneal lymphnodes. Urine cytology, cystoscopy and retrograde ureterography were normal. There was no evidence of distant metastases. The patient also had a pelvic adnexal mass. On abdominal exploration, there was a well defined mass arising from the inferior and anterior aspect of the left renal pelvis, and attached to it with a narrow pedicle. There was no adherence or attachment to the renal parenchyma [Fig ]. The renal pelvis was opened to remove it completely. There was no intrapelvic growth. The part of the renal pelvis (about 1.5 cm) from which the tumor was arising was excised. Frozen section revealed a benign nature. The renal pelvis was closed after inserting a double J stent into left ureter. The left adnexal mass was excised with preservation of uterus and other ovary.
On pathological examination, the tumor was well-defined and capsulated. On cut section it had a firm, whitish solid appearance without areas of necrosis or hemorrhage.
Microscopically, the tumor was composed of large collagenized areas containing bundles of spindle cells. These areas were interspersed with thick walled, blood vessels, fatty tissue and several 'microcysts' lined by cuboidal epithelium [Fig ]. Normal renal parenchyma was not seen. Immunohistochemistry showed strong positivity for SMA and desmin in the spindle cell areas. Cytokeratin (CK) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) were positive in cells lining the microcysts. Estrogen receptor (ER), Progesterone receptor (PR) and HMB 45 (Human melanoma antibody) were negative. The pelvic adnexal mass was found to be a mature cystic teratoma.

Her past medical history included hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Other than tachypnea, the cardiorespiratory examination was normal. The 12 lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement and non-specific T wave changes laterally. Arterial blood whilst breathing 12 litres of oxygen per minute via face mask was taken: pH 7.44, PaCO2 36 mmHg, PaO2 52 mmHg, O2 saturation 88%.
Full blood examination and D-Dimer were normal. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram was normal. During admission there was fluctuating hypoxia, dyspnea and central cyanosis. An intra-cardiac shunt was suspected. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal right ventricular function. There was an atrial septal defect (ASD) with an aneurysmal interatrial septum (figure ), and mild left-to-right shunting only. Color flow Doppler across the atrial septum demonstrated multiple fenestrations (figure ). No right-to-left shunting was demonstrable with a saline contrast study, and a Swan Ganz catheter confirmed normal pulmonary artery pressures.
It was noted that her hypoxia was relieved in the recumbent position. On breathing room air whilst supine, the SpO2 was consistently above 90%, however in the sitting position, the SpO2 repeatedly dropped to as low as 70% with worsening dyspnea and development of central cyanosis. A repeat TEE was performed in both the supine and sitting position. At a 70 degree incline, there was significant right-to-left shunting. The aortic root appeared mildly dilated with distortion of the interatrial septum contributing to the shunt.

Patient was not on any antimicrobial treatment. There was no history of trauma to the chest and his past medical history was unremarkable. He did not have pharyngitis or skin rashes. He was a non-smoker and non-alcoholic and was employed in a tea stall, wherein he handles unpasteurized milk.
Clinical examination and imaging studies revealed a right sided multi-loculated hydropneumothorax (Figure ). Blood peripheral smear, total and differential leukocyte counts were normal. Routine serum biochemical parameters were also within normal limits. ELISA test for HIV was negative.
Therapeutic thoracocentesis yielded 500 ml of thick foul smelling pus and air. Empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole was started. Patient was put on closed chest tube drainage with underwater seal which was removed after one month, in view of significant clinical and radiological improvement (Figure ). Antimicrobial therapy was also continued for the same duration. Patient was then discharged and advised follow-up.
Microscopic observation of the Gram stained smear of the pus showed pleomorphic Gram positive coryneform bacteria. Aerobic culture after 48 hours at 37°C grew minute, translucent, non-pigmented colonies with a small zone of clear hemolysis on 5% sheep blood agar (Figure ). Heavy growth was obtained in pure culture. Upon further incubating the culture plates the colonies increased in size and appeared opaque with enhanced hemolysis. Transmitted light revealed a small dark dot at the centre of each colony. When a colony was gently removed a tiny dark pit was seen in the agar. The isolate did not grow in MacConkey agar. It was non-motile, non-acid fast and did not show any volutin granules. Catalase and urease tests were negative. Glucose and maltose were fermented but not xylose and mannitol. Reverse CAMP (Figure ) and DNAase tests were positive. Gelatin was not liquefied.

His past medical history revealed persistent frontal headache for the last 3 weeks. On admission the patient was nervous and slightly confused. Fever was not present, although the patient complained of flu-like symptoms 4 weeks before. On neurologic examination dysarthria, a left facial weakness, clumsiness in rapid alternating movements of the left hand and dysmetric finger-to-nose testing beside abnormalities in pain and temperature sensation on the left side were found. Cranial computed tomography (CCT) scan was normal. Routine laboratory examinations showed no abnormalities. Serum antibodies to neurotropic viruses, HIV, Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi were not found. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained inflammatory cells (32 lymphocytes/μl) and total CSF protein was elevated (930 mg/l). The glucose ratio was normal. Immunological studies and polymerase chain reactions for herpes simplex virus type 1, 2 and varicella-zoster virus were unobtrusive. Suspecting acute viral meningoencephalitis the patient was treated with aciclovir 3 × 750 mg/d. Within 24 hours after acute onset of focal neurologic symptoms remission of dysarthria was observed while the abnormal sensation and mild agitation were still present. Magnetic resonance (MR) scans performed 24 hours after acute onset of focal symptoms showed disseminated hyperintensities of the supratentorial grey and white matter with predominance in the right occipital region lacking enhancement after GdDTPA-injection (Figure ). The MR-angiography was normal. The characteristics and location of these findings were not typical for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or herpes simplex encephalitis. The follow-up MR scans showed an increase of white matter hyperintensities with enhancement after GdDTPA-injection. Repeated CSF analyses revealed no new aspects. During the hospital course only subfebrile body temperatures could be registered. Eight days after admission conventional angiography was considered but the patient developed severe disorientation and agitation. Within 12 hours he became unconscious and developed signs of transtentorial herniation. The emergency CCT-scan revealed massive generalized brain edema. Artificial ventilation was necessary. The patient was treated with steroids 2 × 1000 mg/d, but died 10 days after onset of his focal symptoms with signs of extensive brain stem dysfunction.
The postmortem examination revealed primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) with focal granulomatous inflammation and partially thrombotic occlusion of leptomeningeal and cerebral arteries (Figure ) resulting in multiple acute infarction areas in the cerebrum. There was also a brisk acute hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy with diffuse eosinophilic neuronal injury (particularly in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, Purkinje cell layer, and olivary nucleus) leading to and sustaining a prominent swelling of the brain with terminal herniation and necrosis of the parahippocampal gyrus as well as tonsillar tissue. There was no deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in the brain parenchyma and vessel walls as revealed by immunohistochemistry for Abeta (6F/3D anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody to residues 8 – 17, dilution1:100, Dako).

Her vital signs included a temperature of 39°C, a heart rate of 110 bpm, a blood pressure of 125/70 mmHg. Findings on cardiac examination were unremarkable, as were the results of the remainder of the evaluation. Results of laboratory examinations included a white blood cell count of 12.000 cells/mm3, an erythrocyte sedimentation time of 100 mm and a reactive C protein of 5 mg/100 ml (0.5 upper limit). A set of three peripheral blood culture from different sites were made. A Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed the same day as the patient was admitted to the hospital. A structure due to an eustachian valve was noted in the right atrium. Furthermore a mobile mass of 1.5 cm × 0.8 cm was noted to be attached to the eustachian valve. Another mobile mass of 0.6 cm × 0.8 cm was noted on tricuspid valve (Figure ). A diagnosis of endocarditis on eustachian and tricuspid valve was made. The patient started an empiric antibiotic therapy with oxacillin 12 gr/day ev and netilmicin 300 mg/day ev. After 5 days from admission in the hospital, 3 blood cultures grew methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus. After eight days of persistence of fever a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed to exclude local complication related to infective endocarditis. The TEE confirmed the diagnosis of eustachian and tricuspid valve endocarditis and excluded local complications due to infective endocarditis (Figure ).

Seven days after the start of these symptoms she suddenly became agitated, physically and verbally aggressive, with total insomnia and disrupted behaviour. She was taken by her parents to the Emergency Department of S. Francisco Xavier Hospital, Lisbon, and was compulsorily hospitalised in the acute psychiatric ward under the Portuguese Mental Health Law. The mental state examination revealed a vigil and fully oriented patient. She appeared distrustful, collaborated poorly and was easily distracted. She had false delusional memories and paranoid delusional, poorly structured ideas of persecutory, magical and grandiose content, as well as a disrupted awareness of the boundaries and vitality of the Self. She also claimed, in what appeared to be a delusional misidentification of the Capgras syndrome type, that robots had replaced her parents. She appeared to be suffering complex auditive hallucinations in the 2nd and 3rd person, with a menacing content. Her mood was dysphoric, with poorly contained, labile affects. Her past medical record and family history were irrelevant. Neurological and general physical examinations were normal. She was started on haloperidol 10 mg tid ev (she refused oral medication), with no improvement of her mental state, although she did have unpredictable, short-lived intervals of remarkable lucidity with almost total absence of psychiatric symptoms apart from a depressed mood. 20 days after admission she developed a high fever with a white-cell count of 27 × 109/L, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 100 mm/h and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 15.3 mg/L. Routine biochemistry studies were normal. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear, with normal protein and glucose concentrations and 20 × 106 lymphocytes per litre. Microbiological investigation of CSF was negative. Her chest film and brain CT-scan showed no changes. Brain MRI showed irregular thickening and nodularity of the lateral ventricles' lining. A complete neuropsychological evaluation was performed revealing a mild impairment of her external visual attention and visuo-constructive reproduction capacity. The EEG displayed symmetrical, irregular, high amplitude, slow wave activity with frontotemporal predominance. An ophthalmologic examination revealed lymphocytes in her vitreum. A skin biopsy was taken for Lupus Band Test, which was negative. Serologic testing of serum and CSF was performed for systemic lupus erythematosus (including anti-ribosomal P antibodies) and other connectivites as well as for most known neurotropic viruses and bacteria. An IgG antibody titer to CP of 22 IU/ml was detected in the serum, with an IgM antibody titer of 85 IU/ml. No anti-CP antibodies were detected in the CSF. All her psychotropic medication was stopped and she was started on levofloxacin (due to dysuria and leukocyturia) and acyclovir. Five days levofloxacin was changed to gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam for due to Escherichia coli-positive blood-cultures (serological results were not yet available at that time). She finally received three consecutive ev pulses of methylprednisolone (1 g each), before being transferred to a Neurology unit. During the following week she progressively became apyretic and her psychotic symptoms gradually remitted. At the time of discharge, eight weeks after admission, she still had an ESR of 55 mm/h and a CRP of 9.03 mg/L, with normal blood count and biochemical parameters as well as a normal CSF. Brain MRI nine weeks after admission showed complete remission of the initial changes. At the time of discharge, the EEG still displayed symmetrical, irregular, high amplitude, slow wave activity with frontotemporal predominance, although much less severe than in the first EEG record.
Psychiatrically she remained slightly disinhibited, both verbally and affectively, with pedolalia and mildly childish behaviour. There were no signs of delusional ideas or hallucinations and she could only vaguely remember the period when she had been psychotic. Two months after discharge she had resumed her studies and concluded her Business School degree.","[[22.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['throat', 'mental state', 'Neurological', 'psychiatric', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'chest', 'brain', 'Brain', ""lateral ventricles' lining"", 'frontotemporal', 'vitreum', 'skin', 'Brain', 'Psychiatrically']","['fever', 'headache', 'sore throat', 'symptoms', 'agitated', 'physically and verbally aggressive', 'total insomnia', 'disrupted behaviour', 'vigil', 'fully oriented', 'distrustful', 'collaborated poorly', 'easily distracted', 'false delusional memories', 'paranoid delusional', 'poorly structured ideas of persecutory', 'magical and grandiose content', 'disrupted awareness of the boundaries and vitality of the Self', 'delusional misidentification', 'Capgras syndrome', 'menacing content', 'mood was dysphoric', 'poorly contained', 'labile affects', 'improvement', 'improvement of her mental state', 'remarkable lucidity', 'psychiatric symptoms', 'depressed mood', 'fever', 'cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear', 'changes', 'irregular thickening', ""nodularity of the lateral ventricles' lining"", 'impairment of her external visual attention', 'visuo-constructive reproduction capacity', 'symmetrical', 'irregular', 'high amplitude', 'slow wave activity', 'frontotemporal predominance', 'lymphocytes', 'systemic lupus erythematosus', 'anti-ribosomal P antibodies', 'connectivites', 'neurotropic viruses', 'bacteria', 'anti-CP antibodies', 'dysuria', 'leukocyturia', 'Escherichia coli-positive', 'apyretic', 'psychotic symptoms', 'complete remission of the initial changes', 'initial changes', 'symmetrical', 'irregular', 'high amplitude', 'slow wave activity', 'frontotemporal predominance', 'disinhibited', 'pedolalia', 'childish behaviour', 'delusional ideas', 'hallucinations', 'vaguely remember the period', 'psychotic']","['haloperidol', 'levofloxacin', 'acyclovir', 'levofloxacin', 'gentamicin', 'piperacillin/tazobactam', 'methylprednisolone']","['22', 'Business-school student', 'Emergency Department', 'S.

A colonoscopy showed a tumor 3 cm from the anal margin with no other indication of multiple synchronous tumors in the colon. Biopsies of the tumor were positive for adenocarcinoma. An investigation with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, computed tomography of chest and abdomen showed cholelithiasis with thickening of gallbladder anterior wall (arrow in the figure ). No evidence of metastatic disease documented. Blood examinations showed anemia (Ht: 28,5% and Hb: 9,5 g/dL) and the rest laboratory evaluation was normal. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was: 15,9 ng/ml (range 0,0–10,0). She had a cholecystectomy and abdominoperineal resection of the rectum. The histopathological diagnosis was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder (T2, N0, M0; stage II) and differentiated moderately adenocarcinoma of the rectum (pT2, N0, M0 in TNM/UICC, stage A of the Dukes staging system and stage B1 of the modified Astler – Coller classification).

The patient was initiated on IV vancomycin and amikacin, and after initial blood cultures grew oxacillin-sensitive S. aureus. The catheter was removed and antibiotics were changed to dicloxacillin and amikacin. Initial echo-Doppler for all limbs did not demonstrate obstruction to blood flow. Chest roentgenogram showed bilateral, multiple, rounded, irregular, non-cavitated opacities. Transthoracic echocardiography did not show heart valve vegetations, but did show a mobile hyper-reflectant image in superior vena cava extending to right atrium, suggestive of thrombus. Fever persisted and new painful nodular erythemathous lesions appeared in both limbs that evolved into abscesses, but neither purulent skin lesions nor blood cultures grew microorganisms. A second transthoracic echocardiogram performed 9 days later showed persistence of the same pediculated lesion that measured 40 × 10 × 10 mm.

The mass was located in the body of the pancreas and was ill-defined with faint inhomogeneous low density at both the arterial and the venous phases of computerized tomography (CT) scan (Figure ). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography showed mild indentation and slight irregularity of the neck portion of the main pancreatic duct suggesting extrinsic compression of the main pancreatic duct. The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy.
The sectioned surface of the resected pancreas revealed a non-encapsulated, partially lobulate, whitish gray ovoid firm mass with 2.5 cm in its greatest dimension. The mass was predominantly solid with some cystic spaces, which contained mucinous fluid (Figure ). The mass was not communicated with pancreatic ductal system. Microscopically, the tumor was circumscribed with focal entrapped normal pancreatic acini in the periphery of the tumor. Glandular or small cystic structures were scattered in the predominant stroma, which created the tumor's solid appearance (Figure ). The glands or cysts were lined by a single layer of tall columnar epithelial cells, which revealed basally located nuclei and abundant intracellular mucin that was positively stained on periodic acid Schiff and alcian blue. The subepithelial stroma was cellular and composed of bland looking spindle cells mimicking ovarian stroma (Figure ). The columnar epithelia contained occasional goblet cells and endocrine cells and revealed abundant pseudopyloric metaplasia (Figure ). Some cysts were lined by bland looking polygonal or ovoid stratified cells suggestive of benign transitional epithelia (Figure ). The stroma adjacent to transitional epithelia was hypocellular and densely hyalinized compared to that adjacent to the columnar epithelia. As a whole the stroma was composed of cytologically bland looking spindle cells, which had variable cellularity, areas of extensive stromal hyalinization, no cytologic atypia and no mitoses.
Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections by the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method. The primary antibodies used were as follow as; Pancytokeratin (1:50, AE and AE3, Zymed, San Francisco, USA), high molecular weight cytokeratin (1:100, 34betaE12, DAKO, Denmark), cytokeratin 7 (1:50, OV-TL 12/30, DAKO), cytokeratin 20 (1:40, Ks20.8, DAKO), calretinin (1:50, polyclonal, DAKO), estrogen receptor (1:40, 6F11, Novocastra, Newcastle, UK), progesterone receptor (1:80, 1A6, Novocastra), chromogranin A (1:200, LK2H10 and PHE5, NeoMarker, Fremint, CA, USA), CD34 (1:40, QBEnd 10, DAKO), vimentin (1:50, V-9, Biogenex, san Ramon, CA), α-smooth muscle actin (1:50, α-sm-1, Novocastra, Newcastle, UK), desmin (1:100, D33, DAKO), S-100 protein (1:150, B32.1, Biomeda, Foster city, CA), CD99 (1:100, HO36-1.1, NeoMarker, Fremint, CA), CD99 (1:100, HO36-1.1, Neomarker), c-kit (1:300, 104D2, DAKO). Both mucinous and transitional epithelia were diffusely immunoreactive to pancytokeratin and cytokeratin 7, but not reactive to cytokeratin 20 except for goblet cells. Transitional epithelia were diffusely reactive to high molecular weight cytokeratin (Figure ), whereas mucinous epithelia were not reactive to it. Scattered endocrine cells were highlighted by positive reactivity to chromogranin A (Figure ). The stromal cells were diffusely positive for CD 34 and vimentin, and focally positive for calretinin (Figure ) and progesterone receptor (Figure ), while negative for estrogen receptor, alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, c-kit, CD99, S100 protein and cytokeratin.","[[51.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['pancreatic', 'abdominal', 'body of the pancreas', 'arterial', 'venous', 'neck portion of the main pancreatic duct', 'main pancreatic duct', 'pancreas', 'pancreatic ductal system', 'pancreatic acini', 'periphery of the tumor', 'Glandular', 'predominant stroma', 'glands', 'columnar epithelial cells', 'subepithelial stroma', 'spindle cells', 'ovarian stroma', 'columnar epithelia', 'polygonal', 'stroma adjacent to transitional epithelia', 'columnar epithelia', 'stroma', 'spindle cells', 'stromal', 'mucinous', 'transitional epithelia', 'Transitional epithelia', 'mucinous epithelia', 'endocrine', 'endocrine cells', 'stromal cells']","['pancreatic mass', 'mass', 'inhomogeneous low density', 'indentation', 'irregularity', 'extrinsic compression of the main pancreatic duct', 'mass', 'mass', 'cystic spaces', 'mucinous fluid', 'mass', 'tumor', 'focal entrapped normal pancreatic acini', 'cystic structures', ""tumor's solid appearance"", 'glands or cysts were lined by a single layer of tall columnar epithelial cells', 'cysts', 'basally located nuclei', 'abundant intracellular mucin', 'positively stained', 'subepithelial stroma was cellular', 'bland looking spindle cells', 'bland looking spindle cells mimicking ovarian stroma', 'goblet cells', 'endocrine cells', 'pseudopyloric metaplasia', 'cysts', 'polygonal or ovoid stratified cells', 'transitional epithelia', 'hypocellular', 'densely hyalinized', 'cytologically bland looking spindle cells', 'bland looking spindle cells', 'variable cellularity', 'stromal hyalinization', 'cytologic atypia', 'mitoses', 'immunoreactive to pancytokeratin and cytokeratin 7', 'reactive to cytokeratin 20', 'goblet cells', 'reactive to high molecular weight cytokeratin', 'reactive', 'reactive to it.', 'reactivity to chromogranin A', 'CD 34', 'vimentin']","['Novocastra', 'Novocastra', 'chromogranin A', 'LK2H10', 'PHE5', 'NeoMarker', 'Fremint', 'CD34', 'vimentin', 'V-9', 'Biogenex', '-smooth muscle actin']","['51', 'San Francisco, USA', '12/30']","['abdominal computed tomography', 'health examination', 'computerized tomography (CT) scan', 'Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography', 'distal pancreatectomy', 'periodic acid Schiff', 'alcian blue', 'Immunohistochemical studies', 'antibodies', 'Pancytokeratin', 'high molecular weight cytokeratin', 'cytokeratin 7', 'OV-TL', 'cytokeratin 20', 'calretinin', 'estrogen receptor', 'progesterone receptor', 'chromogranin A', 'smooth muscle actin', 'desmin', 'S-100 protein', 'CD99', 'CD99', 'c-kit', 'cytokeratin', 'chromogranin A', 'CD 34', 'vimentin', 'calretinin', 'progesterone receptor', 'estrogen receptor', 'alpha-smooth muscle actin', 'desmin', 'c-kit', 'CD99', 'S100 protein', 'cytokeratin']",[]

She was difficult to wean off the ventilator and on day 7 post-op, we decided to perform a combined open and percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT). Due to the difficult anatomy, we dissected down to the level of the strep muscles before proceeding with PDT technique. The tracheal was easily palpated by this stage. We used a Portex ULTRAperc (Portex Ltd, Hythe, Kent, England) kit, with a size 8.0 mm ID tracheostomy tube. Her tracheal rings were rather calcified and we heard a 'crack' during the dilatation process. Nevertheless, there was no problem with introducing the tracheal tube. The procedure was carried out under guiding vision from within the trachea by flexible video bronchoscopy with no obvious complications noted.
Subsequently this lady failed three attempts at tracheal decannulation. She would develop immediate airway obstruction following tracheostomy tube removal requiring reinsertion of the tracheostomy tube. On day 32 of her ICU stay, following the third attempt, we performed a video endoscopic airway examination. Passing the flexible bronchoscope (Pentax FB-18BS, Pentax Medical, Slough, England) through the larynx, we found a fractured tracheal cartilage ring, protruding into the trachea just above the tracheostomy tube. Then, by passing the flexible bronchoscope through the tracheostomy tube, we saw tracheal wall oedema and inflammation. There was also collapse of the anterior tracheal wall on inspiration demonstrating tracheomalacia. This segment of tracheal wall collapse was quite long as shown by the partial removal of the tracheostomy tube.. [Figure & see video file 1]
She was eventually discharged to a ward environment on day 38 with the tracheostomy tube in situ. Unfortunately she later suffered a cardio-respiratory arrest and the patient died.

She had been living near a very unhygienic abattoir and admitted to drinking unpasteurised goat's milk. There was history of fever on and off with night sweats. There was no history trauma or past history of tuberculosis. On examination, she was moderately built and nourished. General physical examination was normal. She was febrile with a temperature of 99°F (37.2°C). Vital parameters were normal. Neurologically she was conscious, alert and orientated. Cranial nerve examination was normal. There was no papilledema and meningeal signs were absent. She had flaccid areflexic paraplegia with power 0/5 (MRC grade). She had impaired sensations in both lower limbs with a level at T10. Perianal sensations were impaired and she had poor anal tone. Routine haematological parameters revealed a total white blood cell (WBC) count of 13,980/cu mm with neutrophil predominance. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR (Westergreen) was 50 mm in 1 hour. Standard agglutination test (tube) titer was 1:320 and 2-mercaptoethanol agglutination test titer was 1:80. Plain radiograph of lumbosacral spine was normal. MRI scan of the spine showed a lesion in the spinal cord extending from lower part of T12 to L2. It was hyper-intense on T1WI and iso-intense on T2WI There was cord edema extending cranially up to T10 (figure ).
She underwent T11 to L3 laminectomy. The lower end of the cord and the conus medullaris were swollen and the cauda equina nerve roots were pushed to the right side. Myelotomy was done at the conus level. At a depth of about 0.5 cm, purulent fluid was encountered, which was sent immediately for microbiological analysis. Under operating microscope the abscess cavity was visualized through the limited myelotomy (fig ). The abscess was completely evacuated, after which the cord and conus had become lax and pulsating well. Dura was closed completely.
Pus revealed gram-negative bacilli. It was inoculated aerobically [Brucella agar, chocolate and MacConkey media], and anaerobically [Kanamycin-vancomycin laked sheep blood agar (KVLB) and Bacteroides bile esculin agar (BBE)]. Brucella agar and CA were incubated in CO2 jar and after 2 days minute translucent colonies were seen. Gram stain from culture showed gram-negative bacilli. Oxidase, catalase, and urease test were positive. There was no H2S production and it was resistant to dye inhibition. The organism was confirmed as Brucella melitensis [,]. The organism isolated in blood culture taken preoperatively, also was identified as Brucella melitensis.
Postoperatively she had fever, headaches and vomiting lasting for about 1 week. It subsided once antibiotics were instituted. She was started on injection streptomycin 1 gm once a day for 1 month with oral doxycycline 100 mgm twice a day for 1 month. After one month she received oral rifampicin 450 mgm once a day with oral doxycycline 100 mgm twice a day for 1 month. Dexamethasone was given only perioperatively and was rapidly tapered and stopped in the post-operative period. Post operatively she gradually improved in neurological status.

227,1242220-1,16171522,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1242220.xml,Oral ulcer as an exclusive sign of gastric cancer: report of a rare case,"In February 2003, a 61-year-old white female with a history of partial gastrectomy due to a peptic ulcer, and mastectomy due to breast cancer twenty years before, presented with an indolent erythematous mass on her left hard palate and attached gingiva. Her dentist had originally diagnosed periodontal disease, and she was unsuccessfully treated with antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; she subsequently also underwent otolaryngological and radiological examinations of the mouth, but both were negative.
In September 2003, a hard palate biopsy led to a histopathological diagnosis of a chorion metastasis from a breast adenocarcinoma, but the results of subsequent mammography, abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray and neoplastic marker analyses did not reveal any evidence of a tumour. One month later, a second hard palate biopsy revealed an undifferentiated carcinoma with a focal microglandular and diffuse signet-ring cell growth infiltrating the subepithelial chorion mucosa consistent with a gastric origin (Fig. ). Although the patient was asymptomatic, gastroscopy showed an ulcerated lesion of the greater curvature of the stomach, and histopathogy revealed an undifferentiated gastric carcinoma with signet-ring cells (Fig. ).
She was admitted to our Institution in October 2003, when a physical examination revealed left supraclavicular adenopathy, left exophthalmus, and a firm and painless erythematous mass of nearly 4 cm on her left hard palate, with no evidence of bleeding at palpation (Fig. ). She was negative for neoplastic markers, and denied any weight loss or gastrointestinal symptoms during the previous weeks. The results of chest and abdominal CT scans were negative, but magnetic resonance imaging of the maxilla revealed an enhanced 2.7 × 2.3 cm lesion on the left hard palate, with thickening of the genal mucosa and no bone involvement (Fig. ).
A review of the slides of both the oral and gastric lesions confirmed the diagnosis of a mucosal metastasis from a gastric carcinoma, and so the patient underwent five courses of chemotherapy for six months, followed by concomitant 30 Gy radiotherapy of the oral cavity. Because the oral lesion was clinically stable after radiotherapy and was the only sign of distant neoplastic disease, the patient underwent laparotomy with total gastrectomy and regional lymphadenectomy in April 2004. No other macroscopic localizations were found in the abdominal cavity. This curative decision was taken in an attempt to improve the prognosis with the aim of subsequently extirpating the only oral metastasis.
Histopathological examination of the resected specimens revealed a mixed undifferentiated signet-ring cell and microglandular carcinoma infiltrating the gastric wall, with metastases in all of the visceral lymph nodes, and moderate vascular invasion by neoplastic cells. The resected margins were tumour free.
Unfortunately, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly and she died of heart failure a few days later.

At the time of onset, he noticed a sudden loss of hearing in his right ear immediately following the prolonged use of a pneumatic drill on concrete without the benefit of ear protection. There was no previous history of noise exposure or any ear problems.
Assessment of the right tympanic membrane revealed a retraction pocket in the attic containing dry cholesteatoma with the suspicion of the cholesteatoma passing postero-inferiorly. His left tympanic membrane was normal at otoscopy. Weber testing lateralised to the right side and Rinne's test was negative on the right using a 512Hz tuning fork. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Pure tone audiometry confirmed a 45-decibel mean conductive hearing loss on the right (Figure ) with normal hearing levels in the left ear.
He subsequently underwent a right tympanomastoidectomy and ossiculoplasty. Operative findings confirmed extensive erosion and fracture of the long process of incus (LPI) by a moderate size cholesteatoma. The stapes footplate was mobile. Following careful dissection and removal of the entire cholesteatoma together with the head of the malleus, ossicular continuity was restored with a Goldenberg partial ossicular replacement prosthesis connecting the stapes suprastructure to the handle of malleus. A repeat audiogram 7 weeks post-surgery showed a 15-decibel improvement in his right ear (Figure ).

His medical history revealed the surgery for acute perforative appendicitis 20 years ago and occasional intestinal obstruction afterwards. He denied any history of radiation or occupational exposure to chemicals. The small bowel series showed an external compressive lesion in the distal ileum and the computerized tomographic (CT) scan revealed a 6 cm, well-marginated mass in the anteromedial aspect of the ascending colon (Figure ). Under the suspicion of foreign body granuloma due to gauze (gossypibioma), an exploratory laparotomy was performed. The whole intestine was found to be covered in severe adhesion; however, ascites or blood in the abdominal cavity was absent. In the anteromedial aspect of ascending colon, there was an encapsulated mass 5 cm in size, and it was adhered to ascending colon and distal ileum (Figure ). The mass was filled with abscess and granulation tissue, and the frozen biopsy reported the diagnosis of abscess. Only resection of the mass was performed, and the patient was discharged without any complications.
Forty days after the discharge, he was admitted again with anemia, abdominal distension, and melana. The colonoscopy revealed the hematoma and the stenosis of the lumen directly above the cecum. The abdominal CT scan showed large volume of blood in the abdomen and multiple peritoneal nodules. The angiography and 99 mTc labeled RBC scan showed active bleeding around the ileocecal valve. Emergent laparotomy was performed and multiple nodules were found on the wall of ileum, liver, mesentery and peritoneum. In the distal ileum, two nodular lesions with 3 cm and 2 cm in size were bleeding actively, and they were adhered to each other. The nodules were diagnosed as sarcoma through the frozen biopsy, and the distal ileum including the pathologic lesion was resected. Seven days later, reoperation was performed due to substantial hemorrhage from the peritoneum, the mesentery, and the small intestine wall. Two days after the last surgery, the patient expired of uncontrollable bleeding due to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
On the macroscopic examination of resected ileum, there were two ill-defined tan solid tumors with mucosal ulceration, each measured 3 × 1.5 cm and 2 cm in diameter, involving the entire intestinal wall and extending to the subserosa of adhered loop. (Figure ).
Under microscope, spindle-shaped or epithelioid cells were arranged as a plate and the rudimentary vessel lumen were detected occasionally (Figure ). Separated from these two lesions, several small angiosarcomas containing foreign body granulomas were found in the subserosal layer of the intestine. Also, the nodules of liver and mesentery were diagnosed as metastatic angiosarcomas.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed and tumor cells were positive for CD31, CD34, and vimentin (Figure ), whereas negative for factor antigen, CD117, and S-100. The tumor cells were also negative for cytokeratin (AE1/3) and EMA. The foreign body granulomas were surrounded by CD31 positive cells, partially or entirely.
The previously resected mass, which was diagnosed as abscess, was reviewed. In a low magnification field, abscess in the center and fibrosis with vascular proliferation in the periphery were noted (Figure ). However, when the periphery was examined under the high magnification, spindle-shaped or epithelioid cells were arranged as plate patterns, in some area, well-differentiated vessels were formed as similar to the lesions from the ileum. The additional serial sections revealed more foreign materials surrounded by epithelioid tumor cells and the invasion of tumor cells to the blood vessel. The tumor cells were positive for CD31 and CD34, and negative for cytokeratin. This supported the final diagnosis of a foreign body granuloma associated-angiosarcoma.","[[61.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['periumbilical area', 'intestinal', 'small bowel', 'distal ileum', 'anteromedial aspect of the ascending colon', 'whole intestine', 'abdominal cavity', 'anteromedial aspect of ascending colon', 'ascending colon', 'distal ileum', 'abdominal', 'lumen directly above the cecum', 'abdominal', 'abdomen', 'peritoneal', 'ileocecal valve', 'wall of ileum', 'liver', 'mesentery', 'peritoneum', 'distal ileum', 'distal ileum', 'peritoneum', 'mesentery', 'small intestine wall', 'intravascular', 'ileum', 'mucosal', 'entire intestinal wall', 'intestinal wall', 'subserosa of adhered loop', 'spindle-shaped', 'epithelioid cells', 'rudimentary vessel lumen', 'subserosal layer of the intestine', 'liver', 'mesentery', 'periphery', 'periphery', 'spindle-shaped', 'vessels', 'ileum', 'blood vessel']","['constipation', 'mass', 'perforative appendicitis', 'intestinal obstruction', 'radiation or occupational exposure to chemicals', 'external compressive lesion', 'mass', 'foreign body granuloma', 'gauze', 'gossypibioma', 'adhesion', 'ascites', 'blood', 'encapsulated mass', 'mass', 'mass', 'abscess', 'granulation tissue', 'abscess', 'mass', 'complications', 'anemia', 'abdominal distension', 'melana', 'hematoma', 'stenosis of the lumen directly above the cecum', 'blood', 'peritoneal nodules', 'bleeding around the ileocecal valve', 'nodules', 'nodular lesions', 'nodules', 'sarcoma', 'pathologic lesion', 'hemorrhage', 'expired', 'bleeding', 'intravascular coagulopathy', 'solid tumors', 'mucosal ulceration', 'spindle-shaped or epithelioid cells were arranged as a plate', 'lesions', 'angiosarcomas', 'foreign body granulomas', 'nodules', 'metastatic angiosarcomas', 'tumor cells', 'tumor cells', 'foreign body granulomas', 'CD31 positive cells', 'mass', 'abscess', 'abscess', 'fibrosis', 'vascular proliferation', 'spindle-shaped or epithelioid cells were arranged as plate patterns', 'well-differentiated vessels', 'lesions', 'foreign materials', 'epithelioid tumor cells', 'invasion of tumor cells', 'tumor cells', 'foreign body granuloma', 'angiosarcoma']",[],['61'],"['surgery', 'small bowel series', 'computerized tomographic (CT) scan', 'exploratory laparotomy', 'frozen biopsy', 'resection of the mass', 'colonoscopy', 'abdominal CT scan', 'angiography', '99 mTc labeled RBC scan', 'Emergent laparotomy', 'laparotomy', 'frozen biopsy', 'distal ileum including the pathologic lesion was resected', 'reoperation', 'surgery', 'macroscopic examination of resected ileum', 'Immunohistochemical staining', 'CD31', 'CD34', 'vimentin', 'factor antigen', 'CD117', 'S-100', 'cytokeratin', 'AE1/3', 'EMA', 'resected mass', 'CD31', 'CD34', 'cytokeratin']","['20 years ago', '20 years ago', 'Seven days later', 'Two days']"

The patient did not recall a tick bite but he visited hunting areas 15 days before the fever started and kept exotic birds (golden pheasants, partridges and guinea fowls) at his house for two years. The patient showed abnormal liver (462 mU/ml alkaline phosphatase, normal range (nr) = 98–280; 1.20 mg/dl total bilirubin, nr = 0.16–1.10; 0.35 mg/dl direct bilirubin, nr = 0.0–0.2) and renal (1.5 mg/dl creatinine, nr = 0.5–1.2) functions and low hemoglobin (9.9 g/dl; nr = 12–18). Pulmonary, cardiac and immunological involvement was absent. Cell counts and serum C-reactive protein levels were normal.
On September 13, 2004 the patient was admitted to the hospital for a second time. In addition to previous findings, the patient showed a mild splenomegaly, hemorrhoids, osteopenia, hiatal hernia, gastritis and inflammation of duodenum. Systemic inflammatory pathology and neoplasia were ruled out. Doctors suspected a depressive syndrome and the patient was treated with antidepressants.
Serum antibodies were determined for Lyme borreliosis, Rickettsia conorii, Coxiella burnetii and A. phagocytophilum (Fuller Laboratories, Fullerton, CA, USA), and Ehrlichia chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum (Focus Technologies, Cypress, CA, USA) following manufacturer's recommendations. FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and IgM (Aliphadia S.A., Wavre, Belgium) were used as secondary antibodies. The immunofluorescence tests for A. phagocytophilum use antigens derived from human HL-60 cells infected with the HGE-1 isolate and samples were considered negative when no fluoresce was detected at 1:80 (Fuller Laboratories) or 1:64 (Focus Technologies) dilution of the test serum, as recommended by the manufacturer. DNA was purified using GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma) or TriReagent (Sigma) from patient's blood samples collected in September 8 and October 8, 2004. PCR analysis for R. conorii, C. burnetii, E. chaffeensis, Theileria spp., Babesia spp. and Anaplasma spp. were conducted on both DNA samples as previously described [-]. PCRs were conducted with 1 μl (0.1–10 ng) DNA using 10 pmol of each primer in a 50-μl volume (1.5 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM dNTP, 1 × AMV/Tfl 5 × reaction buffer, 5u Tfl DNA polymerase) employing the Access RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Reactions were performed in an automated DNA thermal cycler for 35 cycles. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels to check the size of amplified fragments by comparison to a DNA molecular weight marker (1 Kb DNA Ladder, Promega). Control reactions were done without the addition of DNA to rule out contaminations during PCR.

231,1253509-1,16162299,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1253509.xml,Giant cell tumor of the temporal bone – a case report,"A 26 year old male was admitted with impaired hearing and tinnitus on the right side and swelling of the right temporal region which was gradually progressive for the last two years. His general physical examination was normal. Neurological examination revealed a severe right conductive hearing loss with a Grade II House-Brackman facial nerve paresis. A diffuse swelling was noted in the right temporal and preauricular region. CT scan of the brain showed a large well defined hyperdense contrast enhancing lesion originating from the right temporal bone – squamous and petrous portions with a large intracranial extension causing uncal herniation [Fig. &].
The patient was taken up for surgery with an intention of radical removal. Control of the right external carotid artery (ECA) was obtained in the neck [Fig. inset]. Right frontotemporal scalp flap was raised. The temporalis muscle was seen to be infiltrated by the tumor and was excised seperately. The tumor was firm, reddish brown and vascular. It had destroyed the squamous temporal bone, lateral petrous portion, zygomatic arch and was seen invading the cranium pushing the temporal bone superiorly and medially along with the dura [Fig. ]. Dura was not transgressed. Piecemeal total removal of the tumor was achieved with temporary clamping of the right ECA. The tumor was adherent to the dura but could be peeled off the dura [Fig. ]. Biopsy was taken from surrounding bone, muscle and dura from 4 different sites. A drain was left in the large dead space created by the removal of the tumor. Cranioplasty was planned for a later date.
Postoperatively the patient developed a right total LMN VII nerve palsy (Grade VI House-Brackman). Hence a right tarsorrhaphy was done to prevent exposure keratitis one week after the first operation. At the same sitting the external auditory canal was also closed to prevent communication of the dead space in the cranium with the external auditory canal after confirming the absence of any collection in the intracranial dead space. The postoperative period was otherwise uneventful. Histopathological examination revealed a neoplasm composed of numerous osteoclast like giant cells amidst a background of mononuclear plump spindle cells suggestive of a GCT [Fig. ]. The histopathological examination of the other 4 areas of bone, dura and muscle did not reveal any tumor infiltration. Postoperative CT scan confirmed a total excision of the tumor [Fig. ]. Since a radical excision of the tumor had been achieved it was decided to defer radiotherapy. Three months after surgery patient was normal but for the deafness and facial palsy. Follow up CT at 6 months and 12 months did not reveal any recurrence.
Neoplasia of the skull bones are uncommon accounting for only 2.4% – 2.6% of all primary bone tumors []. The majority of giant cell tumors occur in the long bones usually the distal femur, proximal tibia and fibula, distal radius and ulna []. The skull is a rare location for GCT. In the cranium the sphenoid bone is the commonest site followed by the temporal bone [,-]. This can be explained by the fact that the tumor genesis occurs in the endochondral bone instead of intramembranous bone [,-]. The temporal bone has two main components – squamous and petromastoid. The squamous portion develops by intramembranous ossification, while the petreomastoid portion develops from cartilage (endochondral bone). GCTs are commonly seen to arise from the petromastoid portion as was noted in the present case. GCT is commonly seen in the 30–50 years age group with only 16% of patients below 20 years of age [,]. A mild female preponderance is seen but this is more pronounced in the younger age group []. Typically, the tumor presents as an enlarging mass associated with local pain over a period of few weeks to years []. GCT of the sphenoid may present with headache, visual field defects, blindness, diplopia, second through eighth cranial nerve dysfunction, endocrinopathy and change of mental status []. Temporal bone tumors present with pain usually behind the affected ear, deafness and facial weakness as in the present case []. Temporal bone GCT may invade the infratemporal fossa, paranasal sinuses and nasopharynx []. Intracranial extension as in our case may also be present. Dural penetration with invasion into the brain has also been seen [,]. Plain radiography shows radiolucent lesion of the skull and cannot be generally differentiated from other radiolucent lesions. On CT it is seen as a lytic lesion expanding the bony cortex []. Generally these tumors are contrast enhancing due to their vascular nature as seen in our patient.
These tumors generally tend to expand and attenuate the bony cortex rather than erode it []. GCT may be vascular and an external carotid angiogram may be required to demonstrate the arterial supply. In our patient the tumor was vascular but no angiogram was performed. However, temporary clamping of the external carotid artery during excision reduced the intraoperative bleeding. Grossly, these tumors are grey to yellow-brown, soft or firm and friable. Small cystic areas and grey-white necrotic foci may be seen. Microscopically, GCT consists of plump spindle shaped or ovoid cells with admixed multinucleated, cytologically benign giant cells. Variable numbers of benign multinucleated cells are seen amidst sheets of benign mononuclear spindle shaped cells with similar nuclear features. The nuclei are generally hypochromatic with inconspicuous nucleoli and mitotic figures are uncommon []. Histological differentiation of GCT may be challenging. The differential diagnoses consist of central giant cell granuloma (CGCG), aneurysmal bone cyst, chondroblastoma, hyperparathyroidism and fibrous dysplasia []. CGCG is a reactive bone lesion that occurs mainly in the jaws []. CGCG and GCT are histologically very similar and the main significant difference is the greater number of nuclei in the giant cells of the GCT [,]. CGCGs are distinguished from true GCTs by their fibrogenic, relatively acellular stroma, extensive osseous metaplasia and the clustering of giant cells around areas of hemorrhage or necrosis []. A key point in the differential diagnosis is that in GCT the stromal cells and giant cells resemble each other particularly with regard to their nuclei, whereas in giant cell reparative granuloma, the osteoclasts and the stromal cells of the fibroblastic type are distinctly different []. Jaffe has subclassified GCT into three grades but such a grading has not been found to correlate with subsequent tumor behaviour or sarcomatous transformation [,].
The precise ontogeny of GCT is unresolved. GCT and CGCG are histologically and pathogenetically similar []. Cell cycle associated proteins like MDM2, Ki-67 and PCNA have been seen to be widely expressed in CGCG and GCT. The percentage of Ki-67 and PCNA positive cells are higher in CGCG[]. This means that CGCGs show a higher proliferative activity than GCTs. GCT cells are also seen to produce both MMP-9 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) []. Studies suggest that TNF-alpha secreted by the multinucleated giant cells up-regulates MMP-9 expression in GCT stromal cells by the induction of certain transcription factors, which in turn enhanced the rate of transcription of MMP-9 gene. An essential cell-cell interaction in the regulation of MMP-9 expression exists in GCT []. Although it is the giant cell which is the most prominent feature of these lesions it is the mononuclear spindle cell which is the proliferating cell. Several pathways to induce osteoclast like giant cell formation from monocytes have been reported. The spindle cell recruits monocytes and induces them to differentiate into osteoclastic giant cells through release of cytokines [,]. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) ligand is also reported to play a crucial role in osteoclastic cell genesis [-]. It is possible that the soluble RANKL is released from the tumor derived cells and the soluble factor interacts with RANK expressed in monocytes resulting in osteoclast-like cell formation in cooperation with macrophage colony stimulating factor secreted from the cells []. SDF-1 has also been incriminated as one of the significant chemo-attractant factors involved in the recruitment of hematopoietic osteoclast precursor cells during tumor-induced osteoclastogenesis []. The histopathogenesis of GCT and CGCG thus appears to be identical but the biological and clinical behavior of GCT is more aggressive than the latter.
The treatment of choice is complete surgical excision which if achieved can be curative [,,]. However the skull base location of these tumors can make total surgical excision hazardous and not possible [,]. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in eliminating residual tumor tissue is controversial. Some authors claim that GCT is not radiosensitive and radiation may provoke a sarcomatous transformation in the residual tumor tissue [,]. However, other authors recommend a single course of moderate dose super voltage radiation in achieving a high success rate and at the same time lowering the likelihood of malignant transformation [-,]. Radiotherapy remains the only option for unresectable tumors. In our patient radiotherapy was deferred for the present as radical surgical excision was achieved with no residual tumor.
Treatment of GCT and CGCG with calcitonin and osteoprotegrin has received attention. Osteoclasts express calcitonin receptors and can be inhibited by calcitonin. In GCT and CGCG, tumor giant cells and their precursors also express calcitonin receptors. Clinical studies on treatment of CGCG with calcitonin have shown positive results probably due to control of osteoclastogenesis []. Osteoprotegrin ligand was also selectively overexpressed in GCTs and may indicate another possible target to which antitumor therapy could be directed []. Osteoprotegrin influences osteoclastogenesis and may be used for the treatment of GCT and CGCG. Osteoprotegrin is a ""decoy"" receptor for RANKL and therefore inhibits the RANK-RANKL interaction, which is a necessary step in the osteoclastogenesis. This is the rationale for a probable therapeutic use of Osteoprotegrin. Its utility is however unproven [].
GCT can recur especially where only a curettage is employed [,]. Prosser et al recommend primary curettage for intraosseous giant-cell tumors without adjuvant treatment or filling agents, but tumors with soft tissue extension or with local recurrence require more aggressive treatment []. Metastases occur in only 2% of cases and are usually to the lungs but spread to rare areas like lymph nodes, mediastinum, skin, scalp and pelvis has been reported [,]. Our patient is on regular clinical follow up every 3 months and 6 monthly CT scan. He is recurrence free at the end of 12 months.","[[26.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['right temporal region', 'Neurological', 'facial nerve', 'right temporal', 'preauricular region', 'brain', 'right temporal

His pain was associated with subjective fevers, nausea and vomiting. There was no gross hematuria or dysuria. His blood pressure was 140/78 mmHg, heart rate 130 beats per minute, temperature 39.5 °C, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute and his oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Pertinent exam findings included severe right costovertebral angle tenderness, diffuse right-sided abdominal pain and a positive psoas sign on the right. Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 14 × 109/L (76% neutrophils), serum creatinine 1.4 mg/dL (124 μmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 704 U/L and serum creatinine kinase (CPK) 259 U/L. A urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria, 1 to 3 red blood cells per high power field and no white blood cells or casts. Urine toxicology confirmed the presence of cocaine. A Computerized Tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed a sharply-demarcated heterogenous area of focal decreased enhancement in the anterior right kidney consistent with renal infarct, but pyelonephritis could not be completely ruled out (figure ). Volume-rendered Single Photon Emission-Computed Tomography (SPECT) image of a gallium scan showed no evidence of tracer localization in the right kidney to suggest an infection. It did reveal absence of tracer localization in the upper pole of the right kidney suggesting absence of perfusion to that area (figure ). Blood and urine cultures were negative. A trans-thoracic and a subsequent trans-esophageal echocardiogram showed no evidence of intra-cardiac thrombus or valvular vegetations. Further screening tests for hypercoagulability (factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene, protein C and protein S, anti-thrombin III, anti-phospholipid antibody and homocysteine); collagen vascular disease (rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody); and lipid disorders were within normal limits.

The pain started gradually over an 8–10 week period, with the intensity being most prevalent during the 2 weeks prior to presentation. The patient was employed as a factory worker; a job that required combined repetitive shoulder movements and periods of administrative keyboard work.
The pain was described as a constant, deep, dull and nagging ache with an intensity of 5/10 (VAS scale). No neurological symptoms were reported, there were no dermatomal/sclerotomal pain referral patterns, although a slight diffuse aching sensation was mentioned in the right elbow and more prominently right ""military badge"" area. Together with the shoulder pain the patient reported a less intense (4/10) dull sensation specifically at the base of the cervical spine on the right and a vague headache like sensation at the base of the skull.
The right shoulder felt subjectively weaker with inability to lift the arm above shoulder level without pain. The pain was aggravated by specific arm postures and lying on the right side. There was no pertinent medical/family/social history.
Examination revealed a painful arc with onset of pain at 70 degrees abduction, external rotation being restricted at 70 degrees with a catching sensation at the end of motion. Reproduction of the pain was elicited with a Hawkins test and on supraspinatus muscle testing (""Empty can"" test) revealing a grade 4 weakness and pain. Other routine shoulder tests revealed no abnormal findings.
Right cervical rotation restriction (65 degrees) was noted on the right, with a right Kemps joint stress test (combined right cervical rotation, lateral flexion and extension) reproducing the low cervical pain but no shoulder pain.
Palpation revealed muscle tenderness in the right supraspinatus, upper trapezius, levator scapulae and infraspinatus muscle groups. A trigger point was palpated in the infraspinatus muscle, which upon applying pressure reproduced the right upper arm diffuse ache. Palpating the rotator cuff insertion on the humerus and coracoacromial ligament caused significant tenderness. Motion palpation revealed likely joint restriction at the right C5/6 cervical facet joint, T2/3 and acromio-clavicular joint. Of interest was the postural presentation of a ""rounded shoulder"" and increased thoracic kyphosis.

234,1253520-2,16168053,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1253520.xml,A multi-modal treatment approach for the shoulder: A 4 patient case series,"The fourth patient presenting was a 40-year-old Caucasian female. She presented with right-sided anterior shoulder pain, which was nagging, aching and accompanied by a catching sensation on specific movements. The aching pain was constant with an intensity of 6.5/10 (VAS scale), while the catching pain was slightly more intense at 8/10. No neurological sensations were reported. The patient reported a diffuse aching pain in the posterior aspect of the shoulder over the scapula. Nothing relieved the pain, while arm elevation, driving, prolonged sitting behind the computer and poor posture made the pain worse.
The pain started 4 days prior to presentation after spending most of the weekend cleaning the walls at home with a sponge prior to painting. The patient had not had this pain before although due to her work (accountant) she often complains of posterior shoulder tension. The patient had been treated previously for an unrelated complaint (right sided sacroiliac area pain). The medical, family and social histories were unremarkable.
The physical examination revealed restriction in external rotation (60 degrees), and abduction with pain/catching at 90 degrees. Internal rotation was also tight and sore especially with the Hawkins test. The impingement sign was present with reproduction of the anterior pain with a Hawkins and Neers test.
Scapula dysfunction was also noted with a positive right-sided lateral glide test. It should be noted that no major difference was seen with the lateral glide test on the previous 3 patients.
Of importance was the postural presentation of anteriorly rotated shoulders, increased thoracic kyphosis and forward head carriage. A scoliotic curve was also noted with an apex convex to the right in the mid thoracic region. Palpation revealed muscle spasm in the right posterior shoulder girdle muscles with increased muscular tension and sensitivity to palpation in the right supraspinatus and infraspinatus compared to the left. Infraspinatus palpation revealed local muscle spasm with a reproduction of the posterior ache on specific pressure. Increased tenderness was noted whilst palpating the coracoacromial ligament and supraspinatus insertion on the humerus. Specific joint motion palpation revealed likely restriction in the right C5/6 joint, T3/4 and acromioclavicular joint.
A likely working diagnosis of a Grade ll, Primary Shoulder Rotator Cuff Impingement (Neer classification- refer to Table []) was determined. Of note was the secondary contribution of the scapula to this process. The working diagnosis also included the presence an active infraspinatus myofascial pain syndrome.
The 4 patients were admitted to a multimodal treatment protocol, which included the following interventions: soft tissue therapy, ultrasound phonophoresis, manipulation and exercise.
All of the patients received soft tissue therapy that involved the application of ischaemic pressure to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, as well as the rhomboids, upper trapezius and levator scapulae. The application involved palpating the muscle bellies and applying a sustained pressure into areas of muscle spasm until a release of the barrier of resistance was felt. Release meaning the relaxation of the point of muscle spasm with a decrease in the sensitivity and muscle tone after re-palpating the area. The pressure was applied repetitively, using a myofascial T-bar (a plastic, T shaped hand held tool with a rubber tip attached to the end in contact with the skin). Care was taken not to cause increased discomfort to the patient (to the level of pain tolerance).
Longitudinal and transverse friction massage was applied to the posterior tenomuscular junction of the infraspinatus muscle, the coracoacromial ligament (postero-inferior aspect) and the insertion of the supraspinatus on the greater tuberosity of the humerus. The friction massage application was achieved by palpating the capsular or tendinous adhesions and frictioning over its surface with the practitioner's index finger. This was maintained until friction anaesthesia was achieved and the patient could not feel any discomfort. A new point was then chosen and the process repeated. Once again care was taken to not cause excessive discomfort to the patient. At the end of the treatment sessions ice application was advised at a frequency of three applications of 15 minutes with two 20-minute breaks.
Ultrasound phonophoresis was applied to the areas that previously underwent friction massage with a topical corticosteroid [1% sigmacort]. Ultrasound was applied with a continuous wave form for 7 minutes at a setting of 2.2 W/cm2 to the rotator cuff insertion on the anterior-inferior aspect of the humerus and posterior inferior aspect of the acromioclavicular joint.
Peripheral thrust manual manipulation was applied to the glenohumeral joints in external rotation (progressive) and inferiorly to the acromioclavicular joint and anterior to posterior to the sternoclavicular joint in all of the patients where a likely motion restriction was detected.
Mechanically assisted manipulations were also used with the Activator 2 apparatus in humeral external rotation or inferior through the AC joint. This particular technique was chosen for one of the female patients (fourth patient as an alternative) who expressed concern with peripheral manual manipulation after the first treatment session as an alternative technique.
Diversified spinal manipulations were used to manipulate the thoracic and cervical spines at the level of T3/4 and C5/6. All patients were given a basic exercise program with initial emphasis on isometric strengthening of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. This was implemented once a reduction in pain and improved range of motion was noted at a frequency of 4 sets of 10 repetitions, 2–3 times per day. Theraband (extendable elastic) exercises were also implemented at the same frequency after the initial isometric strengthening period. This also included shoulder shrugs, wall push-ups and scapula retraction exercises.","[[40.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['right-sided anterior shoulder', 'neurological', 'posterior aspect of the shoulder over the scapula', 'arm', 'posterior shoulder', 'right sided sacroiliac area', 'Scapula', 'shoulders', 'thoracic', 'head', 'mid thoracic region', 'muscle', 'right posterior shoulder girdle muscles', 'muscular', 'right supraspinatus', 'infraspinatus', 'Infraspinatus', 'muscle', 'coracoacromial ligament', 'supraspinatus insertion', 'supraspinatus insertion on the humerus', 'joint', 'right C5/6 joint', 'T3/4', 'acromioclavicular joint', 'Shoulder Rotator Cuff', 'scapula', 'infraspinatus myofascial', 'myofascial', 'soft tissue', 'soft tissue', 'supraspinatus', 'supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles', 'infraspinatus muscles', 'rhomboids', 'upper trapezius', 'levator scapulae', 'muscle bellies', 'muscle spasm', 'muscle', 'muscle spasm', 'muscle', 'skin', 'posterior tenomuscular junction of the infraspinatus muscle', 'coracoacromial ligament', 'supraspinatus on the greater tuberosity of the humerus', 'capsular', 'tendinous', 'index finger', 'rotator cuff insertion on the anterior-inferior aspect of the humerus', 'posterior inferior aspect of the acromioclavicular joint', 'acromioclavicular joint', 'glenohumeral joints', 'inferiorly to the acromioclavicular joint', 'anterior to posterior to the sternoclavicular joint', 'humeral external rotation', 'inferior through the AC joint', 'spinal', 'thoracic', 'cervical spines', 'T3/4', 'C5/6', 'supraspinatus', 'supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles', 'shoulder', 'wall', 'scapula']","['right-sided anterior shoulder pain', 'aching pain', 'catching pain', 'neurological sensations', 'pain', 'pain', 'pain', 'pain', 'pain', 'posterior shoulder tension', 'right sided sacroiliac area pain', 'restriction in external rotation', 'abduction', 'pain', 'catching', 'Internal rotation was also tight', 'sore', 'impingement sign', 'anterior pain', 'Scapula dysfunction', 'right-sided lateral glide test', 'major difference', 'anteriorly rotated shoulders', 'thoracic kyphosis', 'forward head carriage', 'scoliotic curve', 'apex convex to the right in the mid thoracic region', 'muscle spasm', 'muscular tension', 'sensitivity to palpation', 'Infraspinatus palpation', 'local muscle spasm', 'posterior ache', 'tenderness', 'joint motion palpation', 'restriction', 'Shoulder Rotator Cuff Impingement', 'infraspinatus myofascial pain syndrome', 'myofascial pain syndrome', 'discomfort', 'adhesions', 'discomfort', 'discomfort', 'motion restriction', 'peripheral manual manipulation', 'pain', 'range of motion']",['sigmacort'],"['40', 'accountant']","['VAS scale', 'physical examination', 'Hawkins test', 'Hawkins', 'Hawkins and Neers test', 'lateral glide test', 'multimodal treatment protocol', 'soft tissue therapy', 'ultrasound phonophoresis', 'manipulation', 'exercise', 'soft tissue therapy', 'Longitudinal and transverse friction massage', ""friction massage application was achieved by palpating the capsular or tendinous adhesions and frictioning over its surface with the practitioner's index finger"", 'friction anaesthesia', 'ice application', 'Ultrasound phonophoresis', 'friction massage', 'corticosteroid', 'Ultrasound', 'Peripheral thrust manual manipulation was applied to the glenohumeral joints in external rotation (progressive) and inferiorly to the acromioclavicular joint and anterior to posterior to the sternoclavicular joint', 'Mechanically assisted manipulations were also used with the Activator 2 apparatus in humeral external rotation or inferior through the AC joint', 'peripheral manual manipulation', 'treatment', 'Diversified spinal manipulations', 'basic exercise program', 'isometric strengthening of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles', 'range of motion', 'Theraband (extendable elastic) exercises', 'shoulder shrugs', 'wall push-ups', 'scapula retraction exercises']","['4 days', 'prior to presentation']"

The patient reported that the lesion had been present and intermittently tender over several years prior to presentation. The lesion was initially thought to be a simple cyst and was aspirated by the treating physician; antibiotics were also prescribed. The lesion did not resolve and was subsequently biopsied, revealing squamous cell carcinoma in situ ( and ).
The patient was referred to a surgeon; a definitive excision was performed, with subsequent completion of postoperative localized radiation therapy. The lesion did not recur.
The patient gave a history of having worked for a railroad company for 30 years before noting the skin lesion; most of this time had been spent on the “building and bridges” unit. This work involved the replacement of railroad track ties and the repair and construction of bridges and trestles, all of which involved the use of, and nearly daily handling of, coal tar creosote–treated ties and lumber. He reported that on a nearly daily basis, he carried, handled, kneeled on, or sat on this treated lumber. He also reported that the ties and timbers were heavily coated with creosote and that creosote commonly coated his work clothes at the end of his work shifts. He gave a history of wearing overalls, leather work-gloves, and long sleeves for a majority of his time at work. He stated that, despite wearing protective work clothes, he generally found creosote that had “filtered through” his clothing, particularly on his hands, wrists, and knees, and that he noticed this discoloration on his hands and knees at the end of most workdays. He was not aware of any other rashes or skin changes related to the exposures in these areas.
He had no history of other occupational exposures and reported having no significant sun exposure to the area of the lesion. He had no personal or family history of other skin disease or skin cancers. He was otherwise healthy, was a lifelong nonsmoker, and had no other significant medical history.
The physical examination revealed a healthy-appearing 50-year-old male with no medical concerns other than the skin lesion. Physical findings were unremarkable, with the exception of a well-healed 2-cm scar on the anteromedial aspect of the right knee (the focus of medial pressure upon kneeling).

This compound had been prepared by her son and kept in the refrigerator in a bottle for later use in the greenhouse. AMF drank a glass, thinking it was a refreshment. Half an hour later, she was taken to the hospital by her husband, suffering from physical discomfort. Upon the arrival at the emergency room, she presented a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15, and her symptoms included perspiration, tremors, myosis, respiratory problems, sialorrhea, and vomiting. The patient did not present hypoxia, coma, or loss of consciousness [butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) levels shown in ]. She was treated in the hospital with gastric lavage, activated charcoal, cathartics, and antiemetics. She was released 1 week later without further medical treatment. No neurological or physical disturbances were observed. Once at home, she reported slowness, subtle disorientation, and attention and memory problems in daily activities, such as recalling telephone numbers or cooking.
A year later in a medical follow-up visit, she reported that she felt well: Orientation and speed had improved, as had competency in routine abilities such as cooking, but memory problems remained. No other physical problems were recorded. The brain computed tomography (CT) done at this time was considered normal.
AMF underwent a broad-based clinical neuropsychological examination in April 1998 and April 1999. For some of the tests [Logical Memory test and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning tests ()], an alternative form was used in the second evaluation, to avoid effects of learning and practice. During the interview, AMF reported a low level of education, not having finished obligatory primary school. Her primary role was as a housewife, managing money and the home, raising her children, and sometimes helping in agricultural work. Her estimated IQ was 95 (), and her corrected score on the Mini Mental State Examination () was 28, indicating the absence of dementia. She adequately performed tests of single-word reading, basic written arithmetic, and semantic knowledge. Her writing skills were not evaluated, except for her name. Each outcome was evaluated in relation to her educational level, sex, estimated IQ, and age, bearing in mind that the variable “education” has an influence on an individual’s overall neuropsychological performance.
In the first assessment, her performance was below expectation for her estimated pre-morbid IQ in the domains of attention, memory, motor skill, and constructional abilities ().

PVM attended the emergency room at the Hospital de Poniente (Almería, Spain) because of cephalalgia, abdominal pain, and vomiting. His GCS was 15 (BuChE levels shown in ). He was given a 2-week prescription for atropine (1.2 mg) and antiemetics and was released the next day. He had been poisoned with OPs and carbamates six times previously (all due to the absence of personal safety equipment), with three of them documented. The first took place in June 1996 while he was spraying with methomyl; upon arrival at the hospital, his symptoms were dizziness and perspiration. The second happened in September 1996 while he was working with a mixture of methomyl and chlorpyrifos (OP); in addition to cholinesterase inhibition, the patient showed tremors, perspiration, respiratory problems, sialorrhea, and vomiting. The third documented poisoning event happened in December 1996 when he was spraying with a mixture of methomyl and chlorpyrifos; his symptoms were vomiting, myosis, abdominal pain, perspiration, and respiratory problems. In these four events, the medical diagnosis was overcholinergic syndrome. No coma, hypoxia, or convulsions were recorded in any of these events. In all cases, treatment in the hospital was gastric lavage and atropine, and the poisonings were resolved in < 24 hr.
PVM underwent cognitive testing in May 1998 and May 1999. During the first interview, he reported mnesic problems, such as remembering telephone numbers and the events of the previous day, but complained of no physical symptoms. He had completed secondary school and had been working in agriculture for 10 years. His estimated IQ was 105, and he obtained a score of 30 in the Mini Mental State Examination. Each outcome was evaluated in relation to his educational level, estimated IQ, sex, and age. Tests of single-word reading, writing skills, basic mental, and written arithmetic and semantic knowledge were completed correctly. Physical and neurological assessment did not show any alteration at the time of the neuropsychological testing. He did not receive pharmacological treatment.
During the second assessment in May 1999, he reported that he continued working in the greenhouse. No further poisoning events had been recorded during this time. The magnetic resonance image (MRI) taken a year after the last poisoning event did not reveal any evidence of brain injury. He reported no physical complaints.
In 1998, PVM’s performance was below expectation for estimated premorbid abilities in the domains of motor skills and short and long-term memory. Deficits at the level of learning new information were detected on several tasks, but he showed forgetting of information over a delay only in visuospatial tasks. His outcomes reflected slowness in the copying of a complex figure or the fulfillment of a complex attentional task ().
When comparing his 1999 performance with that of 1998, the speed of processing appeared to improve, although probably due to a practice effect. Yet, disturbances remained in the short- and long-term logical memory, as well as in visual memory, and in motor tasks such as alternation and coordination, which implies programming and motor regulation injury. His score for depression was in the normal range, whereas the Taylor Anxiety Scale score () showed a subtle increase, although still in normal range. During the assessment sessions, the patient was cooperative but very worried about the possibility of sequelae.","[[26.0, 'year']]",M,2005-06,"['abdominal', 'respiratory', 'abdominal', 'respiratory', 'gastric', 'brain']","['poisoned', 'cephalalgia', 'abdominal pain', 'vomiting', 'poisoned', 'dizziness', 'perspiration', 'tremors', 'perspiration', 'respiratory problems', 'sialorrhea', 'vomiting', 'poisoning event', 'spraying with a mixture of methomyl and chlorpyrifos', 'vomiting', 'myosis', 'abdominal pain', 'perspiration', 'respiratory problems', 'overcholinergic syndrome', 'coma', 'hypoxia', 'convulsions', 'poisonings', 'mnesic problems', 'remembering telephone numbers and the events of the previous day', 'physical symptoms', 'alteration', 'poisoning events', 'poisoning event', 'brain injury', 'physical complaints', 'Deficits at the level of learning new information', 'forgetting of information over a delay only in visuospatial tasks', 'slowness in the copying of a complex figure', 'fulfillment of a complex attentional task', 'speed of processing appeared to improve', 'practice effect', 'disturbances remained in the short- and long-term logical memory', 'visual memory', 'motor tasks such as alternation and coordination', 'programming and motor regulation injury', 'depression', 'subtle increase', 'cooperative', 'worried', 'sequelae']","['carbamate', 'methomyl', 'pyrethroid', 'cypermethrin', 'atropine', 'methomyl', 'methomyl', 'chlorpyrifos', 'methomyl', 'chlorpyrifos', 'atropine']","['PVM', '26', 'February 1998', 'emergency room', 'June 1996', 'September 1996', 'December 1996', 'May 1998', 'May 1999', 'May 1999', 'greenhouse', '1998', '1999', '1998']","['GCS', 'BuChE levels', 'antiemetics', 'cholinesterase inhibition', 'gastric lavage', 'cognitive testing', 'estimated IQ', 'Mini Mental State Examination', 'estimated IQ', 'single-word reading', 'writing skills', 'basic mental', 'written arithmetic', 'semantic knowledge', 'Physical and neurological assessment', 'neuropsychological testing', 'pharmacological treatment', 'magnetic resonance image', 'magnetic resonance image (MRI)', 'MRI', 'score for depression', 'Taylor Anxiety Scale score']","['recently', 'February 1998', 'six times previously', 'December 1996', '24 hr.', 'May 1998', 'May 1999', 'during this time', 'a year']"

He was a nonsmoker and denied taking any medication. He did not use hair dye or reside in an area with endemic blackfoot disease (arsenic intoxication). Social alcohol drinking was noted.
Microscopic hematuria was noted in the periodic health examinations for about 2 years, but the patient ignored it. Two months before admission, he developed nocturia about five times per night. Paroxysmal painless hematuria was also noted. Gross hematuria accompanied by lower abdominal distress occurred 2 weeks before admission. His body weight had decreased from 75 kg to 72 kg over the previous 3 months. He visited the hospital, and an intravenous urogram (IVU) showed a mass occupying half of the bladder capacity. Cystoscopy revealed a mass over the left dome area of the bladder. Cystoscopic biopsy specimens revealed a grade 3/3 invasive transitional cell carcinoma with marked necrosis. Radical cystectomy with ileal conduit combined with radiotherapy was performed because the bladder tissue showed lymphovascular permeation with lymph node metastasis. The worker is still on medical leave because of disease.
The manufacturing of MBOCA includes the reaction, neutralization, washing, purification, and packing processes. Briefly, o-chloroaniline is reacted with sulfuric acid and formaldehyde under the catalyst of stannous chloride for 3–4 hr. The MBOCA products are then neutralized with an alkali, sodium hydroxide, at a high temperature. After washing and purification, the solid MBOCA is cut into pellets. Although most of the processes are done in closed systems and are automatic, leakage of products from pipes and tanks has been reported. The work schedule in the factory where our patient worked has three 8-hr shifts, and three or four workers in each shift are assigned to each manufacturing line.
The patient was a farmer until he began working at this factory. He worked in the purification area of this MBOCA-producing company for 14 years (1987–2001), and he did not wear any personal protective equipment during work. He denied working for any chemical company other than his present company. He occasionally applied pesticides during agricultural work.
An area sampling program to monitor MBOCA levels in the work environment of this MBOCA manufacturing factory was initiated by the Taiwan Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), Council of Labor Affairs (IOSH 2003a). The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) Analytic Method 24 was adopted in this study (OSHA 1981). Briefly, an impinger filled with 0.1N HCl was used for sampling. The sampling rate was 1 L/min. The sampling time was > 6 hr or > 100 L air. The solution was then analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) detector. The detection limit was 0.056 μg/mL. A quality assurance and quality control program was implemented during the sampling and analysis procedures. All quality tests were shown to be adequate (IOSH 2003a).
Two consecutive days’ air samples were collected in the MBOCA-manufacturing factory, in the areas where the reaction, neutralization, washing, purification, and cutting/packing processes took place. The concentration of MBOCA was highest in the purification area (0.23–0.41 mg/m3, n = 2), followed by the washing area (< 0.02–0.08 mg/m3, n = 7) and the neutralization area (< 0.05–0.06 mg/m3, n = 2) (IOSH 2003a). The concentrations of MBOCA were within OSHA permissible exposure level (0.22 mg/m3) except for the purification area, where levels exceeded permissible levels.
In addition to environmental monitoring, the Taiwan IOSH also collected workers’ urine to monitor MBOCA concentrations. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) analytic method 8302 (NIOSH 1994) and the method used by were adopted in this study. Briefly, sulfamic acid (10 g/L) was used as urine preservative, and urine was neutralized by sodium hydroxide (0.05 g/mL). After cleaning with the Extrelut NT3 column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and evaporating with methanol, the concentrated urine was analyzed by HPLC with a 254 nm UV detector. The limit of detection was 9.54 μg/L.
Urine from 10 workers in this MBOCA-manufacturing company was analyzed. The total urine MBOCA concentrations ranged from 267.9 to 15701.1 μg/g creatinine, with a mean of 5,544 μg/g creatinine (IOSH 2003b). All the urine MBOCA concentrations far exceeded the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) reference value of 100 μg/L ().","[[52.0, 'year']]",M,2005-06,"['lower abdominal', 'bladder', 'left dome area of the bladder', 'bladder tissue', 'lymphovascular', 'lymph node', 'washing area']","['paroxysmal microscopic hematuria', 'nocturia', 'gross hematuria', 'nonsmoker', 'use hair dye', 'reside in an area with endemic blackfoot disease', 'arsenic intoxication', 'alcohol drinking', 'hematuria', 'nocturia', 'Paroxysmal painless hematuria', 'hematuria', 'lower abdominal distress', 'mass', 'mass', 'invasive transitional cell carcinoma', 'transitional cell carcinoma', 'necrosis', 'lymphovascular permeation', 'lymph node metastasis', 'disease']","['o-chloroaniline', 'sulfuric acid', 'formaldehyde', 'stannous chloride', 'MBOCA', 'alkali', 'sodium hydroxide', 'HCl', 'sulfamic acid', 'sodium hydroxide', 'methanol']","['52', 'farmer', 'factory', '1987–2001', 'Taiwan Institute', 'Council of Labor Affairs', '2003a', 'U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s', 'OSHA) Analytic', '1981', 'U.S. National Institute', '1994', 'California']","['medication', 'hair dye', 'periodic health examinations', 'body weight', 'intravenous urogram (IVU)', 'Cystoscopy', 'Cystoscopic biopsy', 'Radical cystectomy with ileal conduit combined with radiotherapy', 'After washing and purification, the solid MBOCA is cut into pellets', 'personal protective equipment', 'pesticides', 'MBOCA levels', 'sampling', 'sampling rate', 'quality tests', 'IOSH', 'air samples', 'concentrations of MBOCA', 'MBOCA concentrations', 'cleaning with the Extrelut NT3 column', 'concentrated urine', 'HPLC', 'limit of detection', 'Urine', 'total urine MBOCA concentrations', 'creatinine', 'mean', 'creatinine', 'urine MBOCA concentrations']","['about 2 years', 'about five times per night', 'about five times per night', '2 months', '2 months', 'about 2 years', 'Two months before admission', '2 weeks before admission', '2 weeks before admission', 'over the previous 3 months']"
240,1257651-1,16002378,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1257651.xml,Grand Rounds: Latex-Induced Occupational Asthma in a Surgical Pathologist,"A 46-year-old male surgical pathologist presented to our clinic complaining of a 4-year history of increasing shortness of breath. He had been in good health until 20 years prior while in medical school, when he noted a pruritic, erythematous rash on the dorsal aspect of his hands whenever he wore latex gloves. He often applied steroid cream to the rash, but it usually did not resolve unless he refrained from using latex gloves. This rash, associated with latex glove use, persisted during his internal medicine residency. Approximately 14 years before presentation, at the beginning of his pathology residency, he noted that the rash involved his arms. He developed an episodic, nonproductive cough, wheezing, and occasional chest tightness, which occurred at work when he used powdered latex gloves. These symptoms were mild and did not interfere with his vigorous exercise program. He did not seek medical attention.
After completing his residency, the patient worked as a hospital-based surgical pathologist. Typical daily activities involved cutting tissue and frozen sections and preparing slides. He changed gloves several times each day. He did reasonably well until 4 years before presentation (1993), when his symptoms worsened. He then experienced cough and dyspnea within 30 min of starting work. These symptoms, which continued throughout the workday and improved once he left work, seemed especially severe on the first day of the workweek and worsened as the week progressed. The use of xylene and formaldehyde exacerbated his symptoms. He noted an intermittent rash on his upper extremities and torso, occasional flushing with exposure to latex, postnasal drip, progressive dyspnea on exertion, and dyspnea and coughing when he laughed. He noted heavy breathing if he “flipped” his gloves off, and he described an episode of “passing out” 1 year earlier when he “flipped” his gloves off and placed his hands over his mouth and nose. He was taken to a local emergency department, where he was diagnosed as having had a vasovagal episode. He was returned to work without intervention.
The patient’s wife and co-workers started commenting on his cough, noting that he “breathed heavily.” He became self-conscious about his cough and about constantly having to clear his throat. There was no seasonal variation to his symptoms. The patient attempted to reduce his exposure to powdered natural rubber latex (NRL) gloves, formaldehyde, and xylene. For example, he switched to non-powdered latex gloves, although his co-workers continued to use the powdered form. He replaced eyecups on the microscope once he realized that they contained latex. He instructed his staff to allow an hour for drying slides fixed with formaldehyde and xylene before sending them to him to be read. His symptoms persisted, however, prompting him to seek medical attention.
The patient subsequently consulted with an allergist, an otorhinolaryngologist, and a dermatologist. Skin biopsy of his rash revealed changes consistent with acute urticaria. Latex skin prick tests were positive to latex glove extracts. Skin prick tests were positive to dust, cat dander, and mold antigens, and a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the sinuses revealed nasal polyps in the maxillary sinus. He was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. Treatment included antibiotics and a steroid taper. The patient was started on Serevent (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC), Flovent (GlaxoSmithKline), and Proventil (Schering, Kenilworth, NJ) inhalers and returned to work with the recommendation that he use a surgical mask while at work. His symptoms continued to progress, and he presented to us 2 months later, by which time he was experiencing single-flight dyspnea.
The patient’s past medical history was remarkable for hypertension, nasal polyps, and near syncope. He denied any previous diagnosis of asthma, allergy, hives, or anaphylaxis. His family history was remarkable for asthma in a sister and a paternal uncle. He denied use of alcohol, cigarettes, or illegal drugs and denied allergies to medications or environmental substances. He gave a history of chest tightness when he ate fruit such as banana, avocado, and kiwi. His occupational history was remarkable for work in the medical field (). On physical examination, he was a well-nourished, well-developed white male in no acute distress whose vital signs were within normal limits. His examination was remarkable for a body mass index of 30, hyperemic conjunctivae, boggy nasal mucosa, an erythematous urticarial rash on his right shoulder, and diffuse expiratory wheezing.
Laboratory evaluation revealed a normal electrocardiogram. Chest X ray showed poor inspiration; CT of the chest showed mild bronchial wall thickening consistent with mild airways disease; pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were remarkable for mild obstruction with acute bronchodilator response (); and a radioallergoimmuno-absorbent assay (RAST) test for latex IgE antibody was negative. His peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) diary during an 11-day work period and a subsequent 6-day vacation period showed significant improvement (20% in the morning, 22% in the evening) while he was away from work () and progressive improvement during successive days of vacation ().
The provision of a latex-safe environment was explored with hospital administration and deemed not feasible at that time. A full-face dual-cartridge respirator was recommended and tried in consultation with a certified industrial hygienist. However, it interfered with the patient’s ability to communicate, and he was unable to tolerate wearing it for an 8-hr day. We felt that he was at risk for potentially fatal anaphylaxis, as well as irreversible and impending structural damage to his lungs, given his long history of exposure and disease severity. In order to eliminate exposure to NRL, the patient was removed from the work-place. He was advised to avoid contact with latex, carry injectable epinephrine, and wear a MedicAlert bracelet (MedicAlert Foundation International, Turlock, CA). Despite removal from the workplace shortly after presentation, the patient’s pulmonary status did not improve. He is maintained on steroids and immunosuppressive agents and has not been able to return to work as a surgical pathologist.","[[46.0, 'year']]",M,2005-07,"['dorsal aspect of his hands', 'arms', 'chest', 'tissue', 'upper extremities', 'torso', 'postnasal', 'hands', 'mouth', 'nose', 'throat', 'eyecups', 'Skin', 'skin', 'Skin', 'sinuses', 'nasal', 'maxillary sinus', 'nasal', 'chest', 'conjunctivae', 'nasal mucosa', 'urticarial', 'right shoulder', 'Chest', 'chest', 'bronchial wall', 'airways', 'pulmonary', 'lungs', 'pulmonary']","['shortness of breath', 'good health', 'pruritic', 'erythematous rash', 'rash', 'rash', 'rash', 'latex glove use', 'rash', 'cough', 'wheezing', 'chest tightness', 'tightness', 'symptoms', 'changed gloves several times each day', 'reasonably well', 'symptoms', 'cough', 'dyspnea', 'symptoms', 'symptoms', 'rash', 'flushing', 'postnasal drip', 'dyspnea', 'dyspnea', 'coughing', 'heavy breathing', 'vasovagal episode', 'cough', 'self-conscious', 'cough', 'having to clear his throat', 'seasonal variation', 'symptoms', 'symptoms', 'rash', 'changes', 'urticaria', 'latex glove extracts', 'dust', 'cat dander', 'mold antigens', 'nasal polyps', 'sinusitis', 'asthma', 'allergic rhinitis', 'symptoms', 'dyspnea', 'hypertension', 'nasal polyps', 'near syncope', 'asthma', 'allergy', 'hives', 'anaphylaxis', 'asthma', 'use of alcohol, cigarettes', 'use of alcohol, cigarettes, or illegal drugs', 'chest tightness', 'well-nourished', 'well-developed', 'acute distress', 'hyperemic conjunctivae', 'boggy nasal mucosa', 'erythematous', 'erythematous urticarial rash', 'expiratory wheezing', 'poor inspiration', 'bronchial wall thickening', 'airways disease', 'obstruction', 'bronchodilator response', 'improvement', 'improvement', 'unable to tolerate wearing it', 'fatal anaphylaxis', 'structural damage', 'exposure', 'disease', 'pulmonary status did not improve']","['xylene', 'formaldehyde', 'formaldehyde', 'xylene', 'Serevent', 'Flovent', 'Proventil', 'epinephrine']","['46', 'surgical pathologist', 'medical school', 'hospital-based surgical pathologist', '1993', 'emergency department', 'surgical pathologist']","['steroid cream', 'vigorous exercise program', 'medical attention', 'intervention', 'switched to non-powdered latex gloves', 'replaced eyecups', 'replaced eyecups on the microscope', 'Skin biopsy', 'Latex skin prick tests', 'Skin prick tests', 'computerized tomography (CT) scan of the sinuses', 'Treatment', 'antibiotics', 'steroid', 'inhalers', 'use a surgical mask', 'physical examination', 'vital signs', 'body mass index', 'Laboratory', 'electrocardiogram', 'Chest X ray', 'CT of the chest', 'pulmonary function tests', 'pulmonary function tests (PFTs)', 'radioallergoimmuno-absorbent assay (RAST) test for latex IgE antibody', 'peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)', 'peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) diary', 'latex-safe environment', 'full-face dual-cartridge respirator', 'avoid contact with latex', 'wear a MedicAlert bracelet', 'steroids', 'immunosuppressive agents']","['4-year', 'until 20 years prior', 'until 4 years before presentation (1993)', 'within 30 min of starting work', 'within 30 min of starting work', '2 months later', '11-day', '11-day work period', 'subsequent 6-day vacation period', 'at that time', '8-hr day']"

She was put on zidovudine in 1995, when her CD4 lymphocyte count steadily declined. She took the drug intermittently until 1997, when she was still asymptomatic, with CD4 lymphocytes <100/μL and a high HIV1 viral load (>500 000 copies/mL). In July 1997, she started her first line HAART regimen including stavudine 30 mg twice a day (bid), lamivudine 150 mg bid and indinavir 800 mg 3 times a day. At that time her body weight was stable, her body shape was lean and preserved, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.3. Adherence and response to treatment were optimal; she reached undetectable viremia (< 400 copies/mL) and a >200/μL CD4 lymphocyte gain by the 12th week of treatment. Since April 1998, the patient complained about remarkable breast size increase, fat accumulation at waist, and a fat pad grown over her lumbar spine. The pad was 7 × 10 × 3 cm in size by July, 1998. At that time indinavir was replaced with ritonavir/saquinavir 400/400 mg bid due to renal stones. Rapidly progressive, severe lipoatrophy at limbs, buttocks and face ensued in the following months, together with a further increase in size of her fat pads. HIV1 viremia remained constantly undetectable; metabolic parameters were normal throughout follow-up, with an isolated abnormal value of triglycerides (306 mg/dL) in August 1998. Adherence to treatment was full until April 2000, when the CD4 lymphocyte count was >500/μL. The patient was offered a simplified regimen, which she refused, preferring a sharp interruption of HAART. At that time, she did not allow us to take pictures. After interrupting HAART, HIV1 viremia rebounded to lower than baseline, remaining <100 000 copies/mL (mode, 25 000 copies/mL) thereafter. CD4 lymphocyte counts declined very slowly; the patient remained asymptomatic, regularly attending her follow-up visits. Her metabolic parameters, including triglycerides, remained within the normal range at all further checks. She decided to carry on without any treatment for over 4 years, until July 2004, when the CD4 lymphocyte count had dropped to 84/μL. Pads of fat accumulation at waist had reverted to nearly normal appearance; the lumbar pad was no longer appreciable; breasts were still enlarged, although to a lesser extent (Fig. ). At variance, lipoatrophy was still well evident; the patient admitted partial improvement at upper extremities, whereas she found no improvement at all for buttocks (Fig. ) and legs (Fig. and ). Her BMI had dropped to 17.3. The patient was offered a new HAART regimen including nevirapine 200 mg bid, tenofovir diproxil 300 mg once a day and lamivudine 150 mg bid; adherence was full until her last visit, on December 23th, 2004, with a CD4 lymphocyte count of 250/μL and a viral load of 1250 copies/mL.
Our observation provides pictorial evidence that severe combined lipodystrophy in our patient was only partially reversible, even under the ideal condition of a long lasting and safe interruption of HAART. Recent reports indicate that the loss of CD4 lymphocytes during treatment interruptions is frequently rapid in patients with a Nadir CD4 lymphocyte count <200/μL and a high rate of cell gain under treatment, irrespective of the level of CD4 lymphocyte count at the interruption of HAART [,]. In spite of that, our patient could safely carry her interruption on for over 4 years, remaining asymptomatic throughout the period, with >200 CD4 T-lymphocytes/μL until late in 2003. She did eat a light and balanced diet; she reported taking L-carnitine (5 grams/daily) since June, 2000, until June, 2001, whereas she denied taking any other drug or supplement possibly interfering with lipid metabolism thereafter. Under these extremely favourable circumstances, sites of lumbar and waist fat accumulation reverted to nearly normal appearance, whereas breasts showed partial improvement (Fig. ). Such a clear-cut reversal of fat accumulation has not been reported in controlled trials investigating the efficacy of therapy switches [-], probably because of persistent interference with lipid metabolism caused by the new antiretroviral drugs [-].
Severe lipoatrophy at buttocks and legs, instead, was unchanged both on patient's and on our judgment (Fig. and ). Although it is plausible that instrumental measurements at the affected sites might have detected partial improvements, our observation suggests that the loss of peripheral adipose tissue caused by HAART [-,] may not be fully reversible after treatment interruption, even in the long run.","[[35.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['body', 'body', 'breast', 'waist', 'lumbar', 'lumbar spine', 'renal', 'limbs', 'buttocks', 'face', 'waist', 'lumbar pad', 'breasts', 'upper extremities', 'buttocks', 'legs', 'sites of lumbar', 'waist', 'breasts', 'buttocks', 'legs', 'peripheral adipose tissue']","['infected with HIV1', 'HIV1', 'CD4 lymphocyte count steadily declined', 'asymptomatic', 'body weight was stable', 'body shape was lean and preserved', 'Adherence and response to treatment were optimal', 'viremia', 'remarkable breast size increase', 'fat accumulation', 'fat accumulation at waist', 'fat pad grown', 'pad', 'renal stones', 'lipoatrophy', 'fat pads', 'HIV1 viremia', 'Adherence to treatment was full', 'HIV1 viremia', 'asymptomatic', 'Pads of fat accumulation', 'lumbar pad was no longer appreciable', 'breasts were still enlarged', 'lipoatrophy', 'improvement', 'improvement', 'combined lipodystrophy', 'loss of CD4 lymphocytes', 'high rate of cell gain', 'asymptomatic', 'interfering with lipid metabolism', 'fat accumulation', 'improvement', 'reversal of fat accumulation', 'interference with lipid metabolism', 'lipoatrophy', 'partial improvements', 'loss of peripheral adipose tissue']","['zidovudine', 'stavudine', 'lamivudine', 'indinavir', 'indinavir', 'ritonavir', 'saquinavir', 'nevirapine', 'tenofovir diproxil', 'lamivudine', 'L-carnitine']","['35', '1989', '1995', '1997', 'July 1997', 'April 1998', 'July, 1998', 'August 1998', 'April 2000', 'July 2004', 'December 23th, 2004', '2003', 'June, 2000', 'June, 2001']","['CD4 lymphocyte count', 'CD4 lymphocytes', 'HIV1 viral load', 'HAART regimen', 'body mass index', 'BMI', 'CD4 lymphocyte gain', 'treatment', 'metabolic parameters', 'triglycerides', 'CD4 lymphocyte count', 'regimen', 'HAART', 'HAART', 'CD4 lymphocyte counts', 'metabolic parameters', 'triglycerides', 'treatment', 'CD4 lymphocyte count', 'BMI', 'HAART regimen', 'CD4 lymphocyte count', 'viral load', 'HAART', 'Nadir CD4 lymphocyte count', 'treatment', 'CD4 lymphocyte count', 'HAART', 'eat a light and balanced diet', 'supplement', 'therapy', 'antiretroviral drugs', 'HAART']","['1989', '1989', '1995', 'At that time', '12th week', 'Since April 1998', 'Since April 1998', 'Since April 1998', 'July, 1998', 'At that time', 'August 1998', 'April 2000', 'July 2004', 'June, 2000', 'June, 2001']"

There was no nausea or vomiting. She had developed non-Insulin dependant diabetes 18 months previously. On examination she was overweight and there was epigastric tenderness, but no mass was palpable. All haematological and biochemical parameters were within normal limits.
Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated a 5 × 3 cm partially cystic mass in distal pancreas with a possibility of a cystic neoplasm. A contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2 cm mass in the body of pancreas (Figure ). Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 4 cm cystic lesion in the body of Pancreas suggestive of a mucinous cyst adenocarcinoma (Figure ). No liver or abdominal metastases were detected on either the ultrasound or CT examination.
The patient underwent staging laparoscopy which showed no metastases. Laparotomy was performed. An en-block distal pancreatectomy, including the pancreatic mass, and splenectomy was performed with full clearance of peri-pancreatic and coeliac nodes. The patient made an uneventful recovery.
On gross examination the pancreatic tumour was oval, 7.0 cm in diameter, and was surrounded by a fibrous pseudocapsule. Its cut surface showed solid and cystic spaces (Figure ). On microscopy, the solid portion of the tumour revealed sheets of uniform polygonal cells as well as dyscohesive papillae arranged around fine fibrovascular cores. The cyst wall was composed of dense acellular fibrous tissue within which the tumour cells were arranged as cords and trabeculae set within a mucinous background (Figure ).
No invasion of the tumour into surrounding normal tissue was present.

One year before, penis growth had started to accelerate rapidly and 2 months prior to admission, his height had started to increase tremendously, pubic hair had started to grow, his voice had started breaking, and sweat production had increased. Furthermore, he often had erections during the day, got interested in older girls, and started reading magazines that contained pictures of naked women.
At clinical examination, his length was 120 cm (more than 2.5 SD above average) and he weighed 24.6 kg (weight/height ratio +1 SD). His sexual development had reached Tanner stages P3, G3 [], with no underarm hair growth. Examination of his genitals showed a left testis of 2 ml and a right testis of 6 ml, firm and painless. Further clinical examination was negative, except for glue ears. X-rays of his hand showed that his skeletal age was 5 years ahead of his calendar age. His testosterone level (10.6 nmol/l) was raised to a pubertal level, as well as his DHEA-S level (1.30 μmol/l). Tumour markers carcino-embryonal antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein, and beta human choriogonadotropin (β-HCG) were negative. Ultrasound of the testes showed a testicular tumour. Neither abdominal ultrasound nor abdominal CT or full bonescan (209MBq TC99M) showed signs of metastases.
Pseudo pubertas praecox based on a testicular tumour was diagnosed. After unilateral orchidectomy, pathological examination showed a Leydig Cell Tumour. One week after orchidectomy, hormone levels had normalized (testosterone < 0.10 nmol/l, DHEA-S < 0.20 μmol/l), he stopped having erections, and sweat production decreased, as did his sexual interest. His mother reported he had become more of a child again.
Because of anxiety, some behavioural problems, and delayed speech development, the boy was referred to our outpatient unit for child and adolescent psychiatry. At psychiatric examination, January 2003, we saw a boy who was anxious and withdrawn, had problems in social interaction, and a delayed speech development. Parents reported he had always been very quiet, however, since the beginning of 2002 he had started withdrawing himself more and more from social interactions, both at home and in school. To obtain standardized ratings of psychopathology, both parents, as well as the schoolteacher, were asked to fill out the Child Behaviour Checklist for ages 1 1/2–5 (CBCL 1 1/2–5) and the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form for ages 1 1/2–5 (C-TRF 1 1/2–5) []. The mother and the father scored the patient in the clinical range of the Withdrawn Behaviour, Anxious/Depressed Behaviour, and Somatic Complaint scales, but not on the Emotionally Reactive Behaviour, Sleep Problems, Attention Problems, and Aggressive Behaviour scales. The clinical cut-off corresponds with the 98th percentile score in a general population sample []. Although the schoolteacher described the boy as quiet and withdrawn, and mentioned delayed speech development, C-TRF syndrome scores were not in the clinical range. No symptoms of externalizing behaviour (aggression, hyperactive behaviour or attention problems) were reported by the parents or the teacher, nor seen during psychiatric assessment. Further psychological testing showed that the boy's intellectual functioning was below average (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence – Revised []: Total IQ = 84; Verbal IQ = 82; Performance IQ = 92).

245,1262727-1,16202173,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1262727.xml,Citalopram associated with acute angle-closure glaucoma: case report,"We describe the case of a 54 year old, non-smoker, Caucasian woman, a computer programmer, who was admitted to the General Hospital in June 2003, following an episode of overdose with Citalopram and alcohol. At the time of her admission, she gave a history of depression and suicidal ideation for six months. She was not known to the local psychiatric service.
The patient was discovered by her twin sister soon after the overdose. Initially, she had disclosed to the medical doctor admitting her that she had taken approximately 14 tablets of 20 mgs of Citalopram along with 2 bottles of red wine. However, later on she informed us that she might have taken up to 30 tablets of 20 mgs Citalopram. The actual amount ingested remains unclear.
Soon after her admission, she complained of painful left eye with blurred vision, and was seen by the Ophthalmologist, who found that our patient had an intra-ocular pressure of 23 mmHg in the right eye and 60 mmHg of mercury in the left eye (Normal IOP-10–20 mm Hg), with left corneal edema, and fixed dilated pupils. She was not hypermetripic and had averaged sized eyes. She was noted to have shallow anterior chambers (central and peripheral depth not available) in both of her eyes. A diagnosis of left angle-closure glaucoma was made and medications were commenced to reduce the elevated IOP. Further investigations including routine blood investigations revealed no abnormalities. Her pulse rate and blood pressure were normal. She had a blood alcohol level of 85 mgs/dl (Less than 10 indicates safe levels and 50–100 indicates toxic levels). Her blood test did not reveal any detectable levels paracetamol or salicylates.
With regard to her background history, there was previous episode of overdose with paracetamol tablets in 1978. There was no history suggestive of physical illness, and specifically, no history of previous eye problems. There was no family history of eye related conditions. In December 2002, her general practitioner had diagnosed her to be suffering from depression with harmful misuse of alcohol, and commenced her on Citalopram 20 mgs daily. Later, she informed us that she had not taken any of this prescribed medication prior to her overdose and had only been taking Estrogens, given for hormone replacement (Prempak-C).
Approximately 48 hours after the overdose, on examination of her eyes, she was found to have left subhyaloid and retinal hemorrhages. After 72 hours, the visual acuity in the right eye was 6/9 and hand movements in the left eye. The intraocular pressures were reasonably controlled and she had bilateral Yag laser iridotomies. Subsequently, she was discharged to the local psychiatric unit as she continued to express suicidal thoughts and was low in mood. Apart from receiving treatment for her eye problems at the general hospital, she was commenced on a reducing regime of chlordiazepoxide for her alcohol dependence. On discharge from the general hospital, she was advised to continue on Timolol, pilocarpine and dexamethasone eye drops for further 14 days.
She remained free of anti-depressants and her mood improved gradually in the absence of alcohol. After 14 days, her visual acuity was noted to be 6/18 in the left eye, which improved to 6/12 on pinhole. Her ocular condition was noted to be stable. Her ocular pressures were 14 mmHg in the right eye and 15 mmHg in the left eye, but still had retinal hemorrhages on the left eye, with a clearing vitreous hemorrhage.
She was followed-up by the Ophthalmologists and discharged from the psychiatric hospital after 4 weeks with further community support.
In August 2004, her right eye visual acuity was noted to be 6/9, which improved to 6/6 with pinhole and her left eye vision was 6/24, which did not improve with pinhole. She had a left afferent papillary deficit. The pre-retinal and retinal hemorrhages had cleared, but she still had some residual vitreous hemorrhage. Her right eye Intra-ocular pressure was 18 mmHg and left was 19 mmHg without any treatment.

246,1262735-1,16202133,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1262735.xml,An unusual clinical presentation resembling superior vena cava syndrome post heart surgery,"A 72-year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation, temporal arteritis, and avascular necrosis of the right hip requiring hemiarthroplasty that was complicated by deep venous thrombosis in the past, now presents with new onset left upper extremity clumsiness. A head computed tomography (CT) scan and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging study revealed a hemorrhage into the right parietal and occipital regions of the brain. In view of these findings, warfarin therapy was discontinued and as part of the workup a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed and revealed a 4 × 6 mm mass on the aortic valve and a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with bidirectional shunting (right to left after the intravenous injection of agitated saline), mild bi-atrial enlargement, mildly dilated but normally functioning right ventricle, normal left ventricular systolic function and no significant valvular regurgitation. The patient was afebrile and blood cultures were negative. The patient was referred to our institution for surgical evaluation given the TEE findings and the patient clinical presentation. Surgical resection of the aortic valve mass and closure of the PFO were recommended.
Upon examination of the aortic valve, a filamentous mass was identified on the leading edge of the noncoronary cusp midway between the ranula and the commisure. The mass was excised with sharp dissection. A second 2 × 3 mm mass was also observed on the underside of the leaflet and was excised in a similar fashion. Lesions were also observed at the commisure and on the left coronary cusp and were also excised. Pathologic examination subsequently revealed that these lesions were small fragments of myxoid tissue with hyalinization. A modified Maze procedure was also performed at the time of surgery and it required mobilization of the pulmonary veins bilaterally with application of radiofrequency lesions just proximal to the entrance of the left and right pulmonary veins. Another radiofrequency lesion was placed at the base of the left atrial appendage and this was then excised and then over sewn. Finally, the right atrium was then opened in a longitudinal fashion, the PFO was identified at the cephalad portion of the fossa ovalis and was then closed in a running fashion.
The patient was weaned from bypass without incident and a TEE performed in the operating room revealed no residual masses on the aortic valve or right to left shunt. However, a mild degree of tricuspid regurgitation was now identified for the first time. Both right ventricular size and systolic function remained normal. The patient was taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition and the immediate post-operative course was unremarkable. There was no need for either vasopressor or ionotropic support and the patient was extubated on the first post-operative day and subsequently transferred to a step down unit.
The patient did well until the night of the second post-operative day when she developed oliguria that progressively worsened followed by tachycardia and hypotension. At this time, a pronounced jugular venous distention was noted and a bedside transthoracic echo was immediately obtained to rule out the presence of pericardial tamponade. No pericardial effusion was noted; however, severe tricuspid regurgitation was now noted with dilatation and dysfunction of the right ventricle. In view of these findings, a spiral chest CT was requested but there was no evidence of pulmonary embolus; however, both superior as well as inferior vena cavae were dilated. The pericardium thickness was reported as normal. Because the clinical deterioration persisted, the patient was taken back to the operating room for mediastinal exploration; only a small amount of pericardial fluid was removed. Although the pericardial sac appeared to be under tension, no clot was found after extensive exploration.
Despite a trial of medical management, the patient's cardiac index remained low and all facial and neck veins became progressively and markedly engorged. A repeated TEE demonstrated marked dilatation of the right-sided chambers with severe reduction in right ventricular systolic function (Figure ) and severe tricuspid regurgitation as a result of an incomplete coaptation of the tricuspid valve leaflets (Figure ). During this TEE, normal left ventricular contractility was noted with no regional wall motion abnormalities, with the exception of a paradoxical septal wall motion as expected post recent surgery, and normal left ventricular systolic function. In addition, pulsed interrogation of all four pulmonary veins showed normal velocities in order to rule out post-surgical Maze procedure pulmonary vein stenosis. No visible alteration in either the main or secondary pulmonary arteries was seen by TEE or CT. Although a clear unifying mechanism that would encompass the hemodynamic deterioration as well as the disproportionate symptoms of dyspnea with the rapidly progressive dilatation of all superficial neck and facial veins could not be given, it was clearly evident that the incomplete coaptation of the tricuspid valve leaflets, as seen on TEE, would certainly continue to further deteriorate the current clinical condition. Therefore, the patient was taken to the operating room again and upon opening the right atrium, the dilatation of the tricuspid valve annulus was confirmed resulting in failure of coaptation of the otherwise normal appearing tricuspid leaflets. Tricuspid annuloplasty with a 34 mm Cosgrove band was performed with marked improvement in cardiac output not requiring further inotropic support. A postoperative TEE revealed no evidence of residual tricuspid regurgitation and the chest was closed. The remainder of the patient's post-operative course was uncomplicated.

One year ago the dentist diagnosed a cyst with a ectopic lower right canine tooth by an x-ray. Beside an uneventful medical history the patient presented no conspicuous intraoral clinical findings except the absence of the tooth 43. Radiologically, he showed a 3 cm unicystic radiolucent image with a comparatively clear demarcation. The tooth 43 was located on the floor of this process. No resorption of the root apices was observed (Fig. ).
Under general anesthesia the lesion was enucleated and afterwards filled with pelvic spongiosa. Separating the lesion from mandibular bone caused no problems. The postoperative course was uneventful.
After the operation, the specimen was fixed in 4 per cent formal saline and prepared for histological examination. Some sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin.
Histologically, the tumor is solid and there is a cyst formation (Fig. ). The epithelium is in the form of whorled masses of spindle cells as well as sheets and plexiform strands. Rings of columnar cells give rise to duct-like appearance (Fig. ). Calcification is sometimes seen and may be extensive (Fig. ).
Half a year after surgery a clinical and radiographic follow-up examination was performed. There was no evidence of recurrence and no apical resorption of the adjacent teeth could be observed (Fig. ).

The ankle was noted to be swollen with discolouration (Fig. ). There was localised tenderness at the lateral malleolus. X-Rays of the ankle did not reveal any bony injury. A presumed diagnosis of ligament damage was made and the patient reassured and discharged.
He re-presented to the accident and emergency department 5 days later, having developed an area of skin ulceration 1 cm proximal to the lateral malleolus. Ultrasound Doppler studies were performed, which demonstrated the presence of an anterior tibial artery aneurysm, confirmed by transfemoral arteriogram (Fig ).
This aneurysm was injected with Thrombin 5000 iu and collagen 200 mg, after written, informed, consent was obtained from the patient, in order to attempt to manage the aneurysm by a percutaneous route using a method well established for the treatment of other pseudoaneurysms. This had a good radiological result with thrombosis of the aneurysm on both duplex and arteriogram.
Progress was monitored via duplex imaging and on day 3 the aneurysm was noted to be partially patent. The patient elected to proceed to surgery with ligation of the anterior tibial artery proximal to the aneurysm.

Childhood was unremarkable for medical conditions, starting at the age of 17 she had recurrent episodes of prolonged abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. During multiple admissions to the emergency department, abdominal X-rays showed repeatedly intestinal obstruction. No further investigation regarding the cause for this abdominal pain was undertaken until the age of 24. During an abdominal gynecological laparatomy -conducted because of recurrent abdominal pain and dysmenorrhoe- multiple polypoid pedunculated lesions on the large bowels were seen (see Figure ), biopsy was not carried out because the lesions were well vascularized. On surgical abdominal exploratory laparotomy about 50 fibromatous tumors were found and removed from the serosal surfaces, small and large bowels, omentum and from the uterus. Histopathological analysis of these tumors revealed benign spindle cell tumors, classified as leiomyoma. Electron microscopy showed peculiar nodules consisting of mature fibroblasts, abundant collagen with a few admixed myofibroblasts. At the age of 29 the patient had another episode of severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting and abdominal distension, partial small bowel obstruction was seen again on abdominal X-rays. The patient had no further episode of abdominal discomfort until now and presented to us for further evaluation with abdominal bloating and discomfort. Other recorded medical conditions include Raynaud's disease (diagnosed at the age of 19), Prurigo nodularis with lichenification of the skin (onset of symptoms in adolescence, see Figure ) and recently diagnosed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (diagnosed at age 44).
Her clinical exam of the abdomen revealed nothing except abdominal distension, no masses or tenderness were noted. Inspection of the skin revealed dry lichenificated skin on all extremities with prominent itching nodules (see Figure ). Laboratory findings were normal at admission.
The mother of the patient (III10) is now at age 82 and was diagnosed with Leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata at the age of 25. She also had recurrent episodes of severe prolonged abdominal pain and underwent exploratory laparotomy due to a ruptured appendix. Incidentally a large number of tumorous lesions was found, which were later on classified as leiomyomas. Interestingly this patient also was diagnosed with Raynaud's disease and has Prurigo nodularis-like skin lesions. The sister of this patient (III13) died at age 16 of peritonitis and sepsis. On post mortem examination intestinal obstruction due to multiple tumorous lesions was found as origin of peritonitis. Another brother (III17) died of peritonitis and gangrene of the bowels at the age of 20, resulting from intestinal obstruction of multiple pedunculated tumors (as reported by operating surgeon, 1939).
The grandfather (II3) of the propositus never was diagnosed LPD but has a past medical history of abdominal problems, including intestinal obstructions. Unfortunately no further information was available.
Three more members of the family are affected by LPD and furthermore have been diagnosed with Raynaud's disease and show Prurigo nodularis with skin lichenification. All three patients (IV2, IV3, IV4) had abdominal problems (e.g. prolonged severe abdominal pain) in their late teenage years and underwent explorative laparotomy, which showed more than 50 tumors in every case. The receptor status for progesteron- and estrogen-receptors was negative in these three patients. Patient V1 is the 10 year old son of patient IV2 and already had a complete intestinal obstruction, on explorative laparotomy more than 100 pedunculated tumors have been found in the abdominal cavity.
Patients IV5, IV7 and V2 reportedly have or had abdominal problems, but no confirmed diagnosis was available.

He stated that due to the shrinkage he remained weak, anxious and sleepless. He continuously brooded over it. He got panicky whenever he saw his penis, as he felt that it is shrinking back, and remained perturbed for days together after that. Due to this he consciously avoided to see or contact his penis, even in bathroom. He explained that it was due to his nocturnal emissions and a couple of masturbatory acts in middle adolescence. He was extremely religious and attended religious institutions (like that of Satsang and Brahmakumaris). He considered penis as sacred and its gradual shrinkage as an omen of his ultimate destruction and death. He believed that this was due to sinful (anti-religious) incidences of nocturnal emission and masturbatory acts. He had decided not to marry in order to avoid any possible retraction. He remained preoccupied with these thoughts, avoided company, and interaction with females. He requested for medicines that would stop further retraction.
He had been given anxiolytics, sedatives, antidepressants and anti-psychotics at various point of time by many practitioners and had been counselled. His symptoms persisted with intermittent exacerbations without much relief.
Unlike obsession his thoughts were never resisted. His belief had influenced his behaviour and way of life, was shakeable, and appeared more like overvalued ideas. His mood state was predominantly anxious with occasional panic attacks associated with somatic equivalents. He did not have any other major psychiatric syndrome.
A 41-year-old unmarried, unemployed male from a business family, presented with the complaints of gradual retraction of penis and scrotum into the abdomen. He had frequent panic attacks feeling that the end had come. The symptoms had persisted more than 15 years with a waxing and waning course. During exacerbations he spent most of his time measuring the penis by a scale and pulling it in order to bring it out of abdomen. He tied a string around it and attached it to a hook above to prevent its shrinkage during night. There was a history of excessive sexual indulgence in the early twenties with prostitutes and he had suffered repeatedly from sexually transmitted diseases characterised by discharges (probably gonorrhoea) and ulcers (probably syphilis). He was adequately treated for that. He did not have remorse or guilt over those happenings. He continued visiting prostitutes occasionally and described no inadequacy in sex. He engaged his partner in fellatio in order to bring the penis out. He refused marriage, as he feared that his life was at stake due to this shrinkage as he had had many experiences of nearing death due to that. He did not have regular work and was mostly dependent on the family.
He had been treated with anxiolytics and occasionally with antipsychotic medications with minimal benefit. He had received psycho-education. He frequently engaged in doctor shopping and tried to see doctors before the appointment day expressing concern over his symptoms. He often used medicines from other fields of medicine (homeopathy, Ayurveda, unani) to prevent the retraction.","[[30.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['penis', 'penis', 'penis', 'penis', 'psychiatric', 'penis', 'scrotum', 'abdomen', 'penis', 'abdomen', 'penis']","['fear', 'shrinking', 'shrinkage', 'weak', 'anxious', 'sleepless', 'panicky', 'shrinking back', 'perturbed', 'consciously avoided to see or contact his penis', 'nocturnal emissions', 'masturbatory acts', 'shrinkage', 'omen of his ultimate destruction', 'ultimate destruction', 'death', 'nocturnal emission', 'masturbatory acts', 'preoccupied with these thoughts', 'avoided company', 'interaction with females', 'symptoms', 'relief', 'obsession', 'thoughts were never resisted', 'belief had influenced his behaviour and way of life', 'mood state was predominantly anxious', 'anxious', 'panic attacks', 'somatic equivalents', 'major psychiatric syndrome', 'retraction', 'panic attacks', 'symptoms', 'sexual indulgence', 'sexually transmitted diseases', 'discharges', 'gonorrhoea', 'ulcers', 'syphilis', 'remorse', 'guilt', 'inadequacy in sex', 'shrinkage', 'nearing death', 'symptoms']",[],"['30', 'clerk', '41', 'unmarried', 'unemployed', 'business family', 'fellatio']","['medicines', 'anxiolytics', 'sedatives', 'antidepressants', 'anti-psychotics', 'adequately treated', 'anxiolytics', 'antipsychotic medications', 'psycho-education', 'medicines', 'homeopathy', 'Ayurveda', 'unani']","['last 12 years', 'days', 'more than 15 years']"

This procedure incidentally detected marked dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) in the distal region of the pancreas. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed MPD dilatation and a multi-lobular cystic lesion. ERCP confirmed these findings, and no extraluminal leakage of the contrast medium was observed (Figure ). Cytology on pancreatic fluid indicated non-neoplastic epithelia. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) identified 8 mm papillary projections in the cystic lesion, which was a key indication for surgery. A routine gastroscopy performed simultaneously with EUS showed no significant findings.
Following the ERCP, the patient complained of abdominal pain and showed hyperamylasemia and leukocytosis. Distinct swelling of the pancreas and thickening of the gastric wall were subsequently observed by abdominal CT (Figure ), which indicated a mild post-ERCP pancreatitis. Gastroscopy performed for the assessment of gastric wall thickness revealed a small ulceration in the body of the stomach (Figure ), which was accompanied by a mucinous discharge suggesting the presence of a fistula opening into the MPD. These findings, along with abdominal angiography data indicating encasement of the splenic artery suggested a malignant invasion into the stomach by the primary lesion. All other laboratory data, including tumor marker expression (e.g., CEA and CA19-9), were within normal limits.
A laparotomy was performed 1 month after the ERCP. Firm fibrous tissue between the pancreas and the mesenterium of the transverse colon suggested the pancreatic neoplasm was of an invasive nature. An en bloc resection of the distal pancreas, spleen, stomach and part of the transverse colon was performed. Postoperative histopathology showed the distal pancreas had an IPMN whose lining epithelia showed only ""borderline-malignancy"" and no apparent invasion of adjacent tissues or organs. Light microscopy examination revealed inflammatory cellular infiltration consisting mainly of neutrophils around a pancreatogastric fistula which had no neoplastic epithelia (Figure ).

He had a fever of 39°C that lasted for two weeks, anorexia, a weight loss of 7 kg since December 2002, a stroke with intracranial haemorrhage, and femoral arterial emboli. He had had an aortic replacement by a bioprosthesis in March 2002 for aortic insufficiency. In February 2003, the patient was hospitalized for undulating fever (38.5°C) that had lasted for the previous 3 months. The transeosophageal echocardiography showed neither valvular dysfunction nor vegetation. Six blood cultures were negative. The patient was treated with amoxicillin (1 g twice a day orally) for 8 days. The fever decreased but persisted at a level of 37.8°C. In July 2003, upon his admission, the echocardiography (multiplane transesophageal echocardiography) showed a vegetation on the aortic bioprothesis valve measuring 30 mm at its maximum, and a grade IV valvular regurgitation. The white blood cell count was of 14.36 × 109/L (92.7% polymorphonuclears, 5.0% lymphocytes, 2.3% monocytes), the haemoglobin level was of 90 g/L, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was of 50 mm/h (first hour), the C reactive protein level was of 208 mg/l. No rheumatoid factor was detected. All three aerobic blood cultures, as well as the removed femoral arterial thrombus yielded Pseudomonas luteola (P. luteola) within 48 h of culture. The microorganism was identified using both the API 20 E (Biomerieux,Marcy l'Etoile, France) and API 20 NE galeries (Biomerieux). The identification was confirmed by sequencing its 16S rDNA using the fD1 (AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and rP2 (ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT) primers as previously described [,-]. The nucleotide sequence (GenBank accession number ) was compared with sequences available in GenBank using the BLAST version 2.2.9 software (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and showed 99.7% similarity with the 16S rDNA sequence of P. luteola (GenBank accession number ). The patient's isolate was susceptible to ampicillin, ureidopenicillin, third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. The patient was treated intravenously with ticarcillin + clavulanic acid (3 g five times per day) for 60 days, and gentamicin (210 mg once a day) for 15 days. The high dose of ticarcillin + clavulanic acid was justified by the cerebral involvement. In the course of antibiotic therapy, the fever resumed and the patient's condition improved. However, worsening aortic insufficiency led to the replacement of the aortic bioprothetic valve 76 days following admission. Macroscopic examination of the removed valve showed extensive aortic vegetation. Microscopic examination showed features typical of infectious endocarditis []. The bacterial culture of the valve was negative. The 16S rDNA PCR performed on valvular tissue was negative. Following cardiac surgery under extracorporeal circulation, the patient developed haemodynamic instability and renal insufficiency that required a prolonged hospitalization. The patient was released from hospital in February 2004, 7 months following admission.
Reported human P. luteola infections are rare. These have included a septicemia in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus under corticosteroid therapy who developed haemorrhagic pancreatitis complicated by a pancreatic abscess []; one case of bacteremia in a previously healthy patient with granulomatous hepatitis []; a bacteremia in a patient with peritonitis []; and non-bacteremic cases of peritonitis associated with gangrenous appendititis [] and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [].

The patient's chest computed tomography (CT) findings showed a mass measuring 5.0 cm in size spreading from the left upper mediastinum to the left supraclavicular area, which pressed against both the trachea and esophagus and it seemed to involve the left common carotid artery (Figure ). Based on these findings, and cytology findings a clinical diagnosis of stage IIIB (T4N3M0) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) originating from the apex of the left lung involving both the mediastinum and the supraclavicular lymph nodes was made []. The patient received concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (cisplatin 80 mg/m2 for days 8 and 36 + UFT 400 mg/m2, both on days 1–14 and on days 29–42 plus radiotherapy, 2 Gy/day on days 1–20 for a total of 40 Gy) []. After this treatment regimen, the tumor size decreased by 35.0%. Thereafter, the patient underwent a surgical resection though a median sternotomy with a combined resection of the left clavicle. During the operation, an encapsulated tumor was detected in the mediastinum. Although the tumor was easily ablated from the left common carotid artery, it involved both the left vagus and the sympathetic nerves. As a result, both nerves had to be sacrificed in order to achieve a complete resection of the tumor. Grossly, the tumor was in continuity of the vagus nerve was whitish in color and oval shaped measuring 5 × 3 cm in diameter (Figure ). Both cytological and histological examinations revealed 1) Continuity between the vagus nerve and tumor was seen, while the no continuity between the tumor and the sympathetic nerve was found. 2) The findings of aspiration cytology of the tumor diagnosing it to be undifferentiated carcinoma before the treatment included an atypical spindle cell. (Figure ). ) The predominantly tumor consisted of necrotic tissue and a few viable atypical spindle cells (Figure ) which were positive for S-100 protein (Figure ). As a result, the tumor was considered to arise from the left vagus nerve while invading the left sympathetic ganglion, and was therefore diagnosed it to be a malignant schwannoma.

She was diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) elsewhere and referred. The investigations at our hospital revealed normal hematological and biochemical parameters. The urine microscopy showed deformed RBC. The computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a large irregular well defined heterogeneous lesion occupying the left hypochondrium, lumbar and supra umbilical regions, measuring approximately 16 × 13.6 × 12.1 cm, and showed presence of predominant cystic portions with no obvious calcifications (figure &). The mass was contiguously involving the upper half of the kidney. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the mass was suggestive of sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma. The metastatic work-up including bone scan, and CT scan of the thorax were essentially normal. With a provisional diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma surgery was planned. Intra operatively a huge mass was observed in the retroperitoneal region arising from the left kidney and attempts to separate the mass from the kidney were unsuccessful. Hence, left nephrectomy with adrenalectomy was performed with complete excision of the tumor mass. Histopathology showed large encapsulated mass 16 × 17 × 12 cm attached to kidney on its posterior aspect. The tumor showed a predominantly spindle cell pattern consisting of cellular fascicles showing mild atypia, with a diffuse sprinkling of lymphocytes and plasma cells and a few lymphoid aggregates. Only an occasional mitosis was identified in these areas. Hypocellular areas with sparse cells and a collagenous stroma were also present. One area of the tumor showed features of malignant transformation, with sheets of bi and multinucleated and multilobed cells in a background of atypical spindle cells with interspersed inflammatory cells (figure ). Mitoses in this area were 3–4/high power field and focal necrosis was present. Immunohistochemisty for desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin (CK), CD68, HMB45 and ALK were performed.

256,1281282-1,16203249,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1281282.xml,Case Report: Occupationally Related Recurrent Varicella (Chickenpox) in a Hospital Nurse,"A 25-year-old nurse, who had childhood chickenpox, was diagnosed with varicella without mention of complication [International Classification of Diseases, Revision 9 (ICD-9) code 052.9; ] by a dermatologic physician in a teaching general hospital after she cared for a 62-year-old male paraparesis patient who developed herpes zoster during hospitalization. She graduated from nursing school in July 2001, passed the licensing board, and then started to work in the neurologic surgery ward of a general teaching hospital in Taipei, Taiwan.
Toward the end of June, we conducted a study of occupational VZV hazards to health care workers in this hospital. The nurse was one of the volunteers who carried an air sampler for several hours in rotation with her colleagues on 9 July 2002. Saliva was collected simultaneously. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) VZV DNA results were negative both in the personal air samples and in saliva.
On 13 July 2002, a 62-year-old man was sent to the emergency room due to paraparesis after he received Chinese traditional chiropractic treatment from a nonprofessional. He was diagnosed with spondylitis with a T8 compression fracture and T9 myelopathy, suspected tuberculosis (TB) of the spine, and paraparesis and was transferred to a neurologic (internal medicine) ward in the evening. The next day he underwent surgery for total laminectomy (from T8 to T9) and hook system (from T6 to T11), and was sent to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for 5 days. On 18 July 2002, the patient was transferred to the neurologic surgery ward where the nurse worked.
Because the patient was suspected of having TB of the spine, he underwent pleural and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) biopsy on 1 August. According to the nurse’s observation, the patient was worried, anxious, and under a great deal of stress regarding his health because his income was the primary financial resource of his family. On 3 August, multiple pruritic rash and vesicles were found over the patient’s abdomen and lower back flank area. Herpes zoster was confirmed by a dermatologic physician.
During the patient’s hospitalization in the neurologic surgery ward, the nurse attended the patient for several days (on 19–22 July, 29 July, 31 July–1 August, and 4–5 August 2002) before she resigned from the job on 12 August. Her regular nursing care tasks included measuring body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse; administering medicine; asking how the patient was feeling; and helping the patient to change his bed rest position.
At the age of 5 years, the nurse had been infected with chickenpox by her kindergarten-age sister, who herself was previously infected by her kindergarten classmates. At that time, the nurse, her sister, and her brother had multiple chickenpox vesicles on their faces simultaneously. Because of her previous chickenpox history, it was supposed that the nurse was immune to the VZV; while caring for the patient, she did not wear gloves, a mask, or an isolation gown before the herpes zoster was confirmed.
Because she had passed the admission examination for graduate study in a medical school, the nurse planned to resign her job to become a full-time student by 15 August. Before she resigned, she took a short vacation to her hometown in Ping-Tung County, in the south of Taiwan, on 6 August. However, on 8 August, she developed a high fever (39.5°C, 103.1°F), malaise, and headache. She went to a private clinic and was diagnosed with influenza by a physician in her hometown. The next day, in addition to the prodromal symptoms, pruritic rash started to appear on her face, neck, and trunk. She came back to the teaching general hospital in Taipei on 9 August and was diagnosed with varicella without mention of complication (ICD-9 code 052.9) by another dermatologic physician (not the herpes zoster patient’s dermatologic physician). The nurse received treatment with Allegra (fexofenadine, 60 mg twice per day; Hoechst, Kansas City, MO, USA), chlorpheniramine (4 mg three time per day; Mine Ta Chemistry Pharmacy Co., Ltd., Tai Chung, Taiwan), and Scanol (acetominophen, 500 mg three times per day; Scanpharm, Birkerød, Denmark) for 14 days. Because her clinical symptoms were very clear, no laboratory confirmation testing was performed at that time. However, to confirm this second varicella episode before reporting this case, we invited the nurse to take serologic tests for varicella antibody on 4 April 2005. The results indicated that VZV-specific IgM was negative [< 1:20; Merifluor VZV IgM indirect fluorescent antibody, (IFA); Meridian Bioscience Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA], but the VZV IgG was positive (1:80 on the basis of > 1:10, Merifluor VZV IgG IFA), with high sensitivity (93.9% for IgM and 100% for IgG) and high specificity (100% for both antibodies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Negative specific serum IgM and positive specific serum IgG indicated a past VZV infection. Because varicella and herpes zoster both resulted from the same antigen, the VZV IgG-positive reaction was excluded from the herpes zoster. It was also excluded because the nurse did not get herpes zoster from the second episode of varicella on 9 August 2002 to 4 April 2005. The nurse is now convalescing.","[[25.0, 'year']]",M,2005-10,"['T8', 'T9', 'spine', 'T8 to T9', 'T6 to T11', 'spine', 'pleural', 'abdomen', 'lower back flank area', 'faces', 'face', 'neck', 'trunk']","['chickenpox', 'varicella', 'complication', 'paraparesis', 'herpes zoster', 'VZV DNA', 'paraparesis', 'spondylitis', 'T8 compression fracture', 'T9 myelopathy', 'tuberculosis', 'TB', 'paraparesis', 'TB of the spine', 'worried', 'anxious', 'stress', 'pruritic rash', 'vesicles', 'Herpes zoster', 'infected with chickenpox', 'infected', 'chickenpox vesicles', 'chickenpox', 'immune to the VZV', 'herpes zoster', 'fever', 'malaise', 'headache', 'influenza', 'prodromal symptoms', 'pruritic rash', 'varicella', 'complication', 'herpes zoster', 'symptoms', 'varicella episode', 'VZV infection', 'varicella', 'herpes zoster', 'VZV IgG-positive reaction', 'herpes zoster', 'herpes zoster', 'varicella']","['Allegra', 'fexofenadine', 'chlorpheniramine', 'Scanol', 'acetominophen']","['25', 'nurse', '62', 'July 2001', 'licensing board', 'Taipei, Taiwan', 'nurse', '9 July 2002', '13 July 2002', '62', 'emergency room', 'internal medicine', 'ward', 'surgical intensive care unit', 'SICU', '18 July 2002', 'neurologic surgery ward', 'July, 29 July, 31 July–1 August', 'August 2002', '5', 'nurse', 'kindergarten classmates', 'nurse', 'medical school', 'nurse', 'resign', 'full-time student', '15 August', 'Ping-Tung County', 'south of Taiwan', 'August.

Her previous medical history was uneventfull and Pap smear was normal. Transvaginal ultrasonography identified a cystic mass adjacent to the right ovary. Serum CA 125 was 5.1 U/ml (reference range: < 35 U/ml). At laparoscopy a dilated fallopian tube with bluish discoloration was found. The contralateral fallopian tube, ovaries and uterus were unremarkable. Exploration of the abdomino-pelvic cavity revealed smooth and shiny peritoneal surphace. Obtained peritoneal and pelvic washing were negative. Fine needle aspiration of dilated part of the fallopian tube revealed a 4 ml of bloody content. Cytological findings were consistent with hematosalpinx. Right salpingectomy was performed without using endoscopic bag. The patient was followed up by means of ultrasonography and serum CA 125 for 4.6 years. During this period she had no evidence of the disease.
Grossly, a 7.0 cm long fallopian tube was irregularly dilated up to 4.4 cm in diameter at the ampulary region. The fimbriae were intact. The serosal surphace was smooth. Sections of the dilated part of the fallopian tube revealed a cystic tumor with focally yellow to tan, soft papillary excrescences protruding into the lumen (Fig. ) and foci of intracystic hemorrhage. On microscopic examination the papillae were covered by serous type of epithelium, displaying stratification and budding with focal nuclear atypia (Fig. ). Three types of cells were recognised; ciliated cells, hob-nail cells and mesothelium-like cells. Small foci of tumor tissue necroses and hemorrhage were noted.

He had been in good health and had arrived Bangkok 6 days earlier. Three days prior to admission, he developed fever and difficulty in swallowing. He also had pruritus of his right leg and buttock which resulted in extensive excoriation. He had became intermittently confused and refused to eat or drink. There were episodes of agitation and he was reported to have complained of shortness of breath incited by fanning.
One day prior to entry, he was unable to swallow his saliva. His mental status alternated between normal periods and confusion. He gave a history of dog bite 10 years previously but no post exposure vaccination was administered and he denied any recent animal bites or contact with bats.
On admission, he was conscious and well co-operative. He complained of a severely sore throat. He insisted on sitting and continuously spitting out saliva. His body temperature was 39.1°C, blood pressure 130/70 mmHg, heart rate 120 and respiration 30 per minute. There was crepitus on the left side of his neck without signs of inflammation. There were no focal neurological signs. His palatopharyngeal muscle functions were intact but the gag reflex was hyperactive. Aero- and hydrophobic spasms could not be induced. Indirect laryngoscopic examination showed no abnormality. Laboratory studies revealed a leucocytosis of 28,400 with 89.6% of neutrophils. His serum amylase level was slightly elevated (443 U/L, normal range 28–100 U/L). The computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain was unremarkable. Lumbar puncture revealed an acellular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and normal protein and sugar levels. Lateral neck radiographs showed air in retropharyngeal space (Figure ) and a chest x-ray performed at the same time showed evidence of pneumomediastinum (Figure ). A liquid barium esophagogram failed to show any point of leakage. Surgical consultation was obtained for exploration. Between admission and operation, his mental state was clear and he showed no signs of aggression and the differential diagnosis of possible rabies was disregarded.
Operative findings were unremarkable. There was no evidence of perforation in upper esophagus and oropharynx. Retropharyngeal area was normal without any accumulation of fluid or purulent discharge.
He required assisted ventilation postoperatively but was able to move limbs voluntarily. He remained rational and cooperative. His hypernatremia (Na 157 mOsm/L) was rapidly corrected to140 mOsm/L within the following 11 hours. On the second postoperative day, he developed brief generalized tonic- clonic seizures. Intravenous phenytoin was initiated. Serial seizures developed on day 6. Repeated lumbar puncture and CT scan were unremarkable. He was conscious but failed to communicate. Paralysis of all limbs with absence of deep tendon reflexes was noted on the same day. He became comatose on day 9. Paralytic rabies was then suspected and rabies virus RNA was demonstrable in saliva but not in the urine by nucleic acid sequence based amplification technique (3).

This was the only episode of symptoms associated with guinea pig exposure; she had handled the pet previously without exhibiting symptoms. Within minutes of holding the guinea pig, she developed ocular itching, lacrimation, and periorbital angioedema. Symptoms rapidly progressed to facial urticaria and angioedema, rhinorrhea, throat tightness, and dyspnea. She had difficulty speaking, repeatedly attempted to clear her throat, and expressed feelings of impending doom. There was no coughing or audible wheezing.
Treatment within 20 minutes included diphenhydramine 25 mg, followed by nebulized albuterol at an urgent care clinic. Although her vital signs were not available, her mother denied she had low blood pressure. The symptoms resolved within two hours without recurrence. Epinephrine and corticosteroids were not administered.
She has since avoided guinea pig exposure and has had no further symptoms other than those related to EIA. She reported previous casual exposure to guinea pigs without adverse reaction, but had not kept any rodents as pets. She denied symptoms on previous exposures to dogs, cats, and other caged rodents.
Her past medical history was significant for episodic bronchitis, croup, sinusitis, and migraine headaches. She had no history of perennial or seasonal rhinitis. Her only medication was propranolol for migraine prophylaxis. Prior and current spirometry was normal. An exercise challenge within the past year was consistent with EIA.

Within minutes of cleaning her pet guinea pig's cage, she developed throat tightness, severe dyspnea, and anxious feelings. She denied coughing, wheezing, and urticaria. A feeling of ""impending doom"" was not specifically stated. Her symptoms resolved spontaneously one hour after departing outdoors. She did not take medication or seek medical attention.
Her past medical history was significant for irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Daily medication included sertraline, nasal fluticasone, and oral contraceptives.

261,1282588-1,16250914,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1282588.xml,Small bowel Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors can physiologically alter gut motility before causing mechanical obstruction,"A 69 year old lady presented 11 years ago with pain of mild to moderate severity on the right side of her abdomen. This pain was intermittent, described as 'no more than a dull ache' and associated with nausea, bloating and flatulence. She also suffered from constipation and experienced partial relief of her symptoms following defeacation. She reported worsening of her symptoms after a heavy meal, and experienced occasional bouts of steatorrhea. Physical examination revealed mild right-sided abdominal tenderness only.
Apart from the above she was a healthy lady without any co morbidity and no history of previous abdominal surgery. Initial investigations included an abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan and an oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD), which did not reveal any abnormality. Flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy were also unremarkable. Her pain was thought to be due to a slow transit colon and she was advised to take laxatives on a regular basis, which resulted in partial and temporary relief of her symptoms. Although her condition did not impact her lifestyle significantly, her symptoms never subsided completely and almost two years following initial presentation she underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a cream absorption test, wheat intolerance test and a CT scan of her abdomen. All of these did not reveal any abnormality and thus irritable bowel syndrome was thought to represent best her condition. She was also advised to take antispasmodics together with various combinations of laxatives and a course of Pancrelipase (Creon) tablets for presumed pancreatic insufficiency, which resulted in only temporary relief.
An opinion of a gastroenterology consultant physician was sought, resulting in another abdominal USS and OGD, as well as a barium follow through study which were all normal and thus she continued to take symptomatic treatment.
Finally, 11 years from presentation, the patient was admitted to hospital with acute small bowel obstruction and underwent a laparotomy within 24 hours of admission after adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement. At the operation a sizable mid-ileum, obstructing tumor was revealed, that was wedge resected with adequate gross margins followed by end to end hand sewn anastomosis. The rest of the laparotomy was unremarkable with no evidence of macroscopic spread of disease.
Histopathological analysis revealed a densely crowded spindle and polygonal cell tumour showing moderate nuclear pleomorphism (Figures and ) . No mitoses were found and the tumour spread into the mucosa and outwards into the serosa. There was no lymph nodal spread. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated positive staining for CD117 (cKit) (figure ), and negative staining for broad range cytokeratins (MNF 116), CD34, desmin, S-100 and chromogranin. Although there were no mitoses, based on the size (80 × 40 × 50 mm), the tumour was classified as a GIST of intermediate malignant potential.
The patient made an uneventful recovery and remarkably, all her previous abdominal symptoms were completely resolved. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis performed subsequently did not reveal the presence of metastatic disease. Her case was discussed in our multidisciplinary team meeting and it was decided not to proceed with any adjuvant treatment. At one year follow up our patient was a very happy lady completely free of her abdominal symptoms.","[[69.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['right side of her abdomen', 'right-sided abdominal', 'abdominal', 'abdominal', 'colon', 'abdomen', 'bowel', 'pancreatic', 'abdominal', 'small bowel', 'mid-ileum', 'spindle', 'polygonal cell', 'mucosa', 'serosa', 'lymph nodal', 'abdominal', 'chest', 'abdomen', 'pelvis', 'abdominal']","['pain', 'pain', 'nausea', 'bloating', 'flatulence', 'constipation', 'symptoms', 'defeacation', 'symptoms', 'steatorrhea', 'right-sided abdominal tenderness', 'healthy', 'co morbidity', 'abnormality', 'pain', 'slow transit colon', 'symptoms', 'symptoms', 'abnormality', 'irritable bowel syndrome', 'pancreatic insufficiency', 'small bowel obstruction', 'sizable mid-ileum', 'tumor', 'rest of the laparotomy was unremarkable', 'macroscopic spread of disease', 'crowded spindle', 'polygonal cell tumour', 'nuclear pleomorphism', 'mitoses', 'tumour', 'lymph nodal spread', 'mitoses', 'tumour', 'GIST', 'abdominal symptoms', 'metastatic disease', 'abdominal symptoms']","['Pancrelipase', 'Creon']",['69'],"['Physical examination', 'abdominal surgery', 'abdominal ultrasound scan', 'USS', 'hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan', 'oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy', 'OGD', 'Flexible sigmoidoscopy', 'colonoscopy', 'laxatives', 'endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography', 'ERCP', 'cream absorption test', 'wheat intolerance test', 'CT scan of her abdomen', 'antispasmodics', 'laxatives', 'abdominal USS', 'OGD', 'barium', 'symptomatic treatment', 'laparotomy', 'fluid and electrolyte replacement', 'wedge resected with adequate gross margins', 'end to end hand sewn anastomosis', 'Histopathological analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'CD117', 'cKit', 'broad range cytokeratins', 'CD34', 'desmin', 'S-100', 'chromogranin', 'CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis', 'adjuvant treatment']","['11 years ago', 'within 24 hours of admission']"

The patient was complaining of typical coronary chest pain during the last twelve hours. He had a history of dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking habit and a transient ischemic attack without any sensitive or motor squele one year ago. On admission, his blood pressure was 100/60 and heart rate was 110 beats per minute. Cardiac examination revealed jugular vein distension, and no significant heart murmurs. The ECG showed significant Q waves in II, III and aVf leads with mild ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVf and V4R. The chest radiograph revealed no cardiomegaly and clear lung fields. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed showing akinetic inferoseptal, inferior, and inferolateral segments with estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%, right ventricle showed a global hipokinesia with severe systolic dysfunction and inferior vena cava plethora. The patient was initially treated with aspirin, low-molecular-weight heparin, dobutamine and saline infusions, and was scheduled for early catheterization. Coronary angiography showed total occlusion of right coronary artery proximal segment and two additional 70% stenoses in the first diagonal and obtuse marginal branches. Percutaneous revascularization was dismissed after a failed attempt of right coronary artery opening, then, the patient was treated using conservative medical therapy (aspirin 100 mg/day, clopidogrel 75 mg/day, simvastatin 20 mg/day and enalapril 10 mg/day), anticoagulation was maintained for 72 hours, and beta blocker therapy was not started because Mobitz I atrioventricular block phases were detected in continuous ECG monitoring. The later clinical outcome in the Coronary Care Unit was favourable, and the patient was discharged six days after to cardiology hospitalization unit. Nine days after hospital admission, the patient complained about sudden chest pain and rest dyspnea, his blood pressure was 80/40 and cardiac examination revealed a new harsh, holosystolic murmur along the left sternal border. Transthoracic echocardiography was immediately performed showing complex ventricular septal defect with a dissection tract that originated on left side of the basal inferoseptal akinetic segments, extended beyond the septum dissecting the right ventricular wall, and subsequently re-entered into the right ventricle chamber (figures , and ). No significant right ventricle outflow tract obstruction was present. The patient was scheduled for immediate surgical intervention, and hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with myocardial protection was established in the following two hours. The septal rupture was approached through the infarct, and prosthetic material (Gore-Tex® patch) was used to reconstruct the septum, additionally, two bypasses using vein grafts were done in first diagonal and posterior descending arteries. Postoperative evolution was favourable with rapid resolution of cardiogenic shock situation. One month later transesophageal echocardiography was performed (figure , Panel C) showing neither right ventricle dissecting tract or residual shunt. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%, and right ventricular systolic function was only mildly depressed. At six-month follow-up the patient remains stable and without any cardiac symptoms.","[[59.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['myocardial', 'coronary chest', 'Cardiac', 'jugular vein', 'heart', 'chest', 'lung fields', 'Transthoracic', 'inferoseptal, inferior, and inferolateral segments', 'left ventricular', 'right ventricle', 'inferior vena cava', 'Coronary', 'right coronary artery proximal segment', 'first diagonal', 'obtuse marginal branches', 'right coronary artery', 'atrioventricular', 'chest', 'cardiac', 'left sternal border', 'ventricular septal', 'left side of the basal inferoseptal akinetic segments', 'septum', 'right ventricular wall', 'right ventricle chamber', 'right ventricle outflow tract', 'cardiopulmonary', 'myocardial', 'septal', 'septum', 'vein', 'first diagonal and posterior descending arteries', 'transesophageal', 'right ventricle', 'right ventricular', 'cardiac']","['ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction', 'coronary chest pain', 'dyslipidemia', 'diabetes mellitus', 'transient ischemic attack', 'sensitive', 'motor squele', 'jugular vein distension', 'heart murmurs', 'Q waves in II, III and aVf leads', 'ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVf and V4R', 'cardiomegaly', 'clear lung fields', 'akinetic', 'global hipokinesia', 'systolic dysfunction', 'inferior vena cava plethora', 'total occlusion of right coronary artery proximal segment', 'stenoses', 'Mobitz I atrioventricular block phases', 'chest pain', 'rest dyspnea', 'holosystolic murmur', 'ventricular septal defect', 'dissection tract', 'septum dissecting the right ventricular wall', 'right ventricle outflow tract obstruction', 'septal rupture', 'infarct', 'rapid resolution of cardiogenic shock situation', 'right ventricle dissecting tract', 'residual shunt', 'right ventricular systolic function was only mildly depressed', 'cardiac symptoms']","['aspirin', 'low-molecular-weight heparin', 'heparin', 'dobutamine', 'saline', 'aspirin', 'clopidogrel', 'simvastatin', 'enalapril']","['59', 'cardiology hospitalization unit']","['blood pressure', 'heart rate', 'ECG', 'chest radiograph', 'Transthoracic echocardiography', 'estimated left ventricular ejection fraction', 'catheterization', 'Coronary angiography', 'Percutaneous revascularization', 'right coronary artery opening', 'conservative medical therapy', 'anticoagulation', 'beta blocker therapy', 'ECG', 'blood pressure', 'cardiac examination', 'Transthoracic echocardiography', 'surgical intervention', 'hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with myocardial protection was established', 'prosthetic material (Gore-Tex® patch) was used to reconstruct', 'prosthetic material (Gore-Tex® patch) was used to reconstruct the septum', 'bypasses using vein grafts were done in first diagonal and posterior descending arteries', 'transesophageal echocardiography', 'Left ventricular ejection fraction']","['last twelve hours', 'one year ago', 'one year ago', 'two hours', 'Postoperative', 'One month']"

She developed progressive inter-scapular pain followed by lower extremity paresthesias. On the day of admission she noted severe weakness in both legs which developed over the course of 3–4 hours, resulting in the inability to ambulate. She denied fever, rigors, nausea, emesis, or diarrhea prior to admission. She also reported urinary hesitancy for 2–3 days prior to admission, with loss of bladder control on the day of admission. There was no loss of bowel control. At the time of hospital presentation, she was awake, alert, oriented, and not in acute cardiopulmonary distress. The vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 134/82 mmHg, temperature 97.8°F, pulse 76/minute, and a respiratory rate of 18/minute. She was unable to stand or ambulate. Physical exam revealed ascending sensory deficits to the T4 region below her breasts. Ankle reflexes were absent bilaterally. Patellar reflexes were 1/4 bilaterally and Babinski reflexes were up-going bilaterally. Initial laboratory data revealed a leukocytosis of 18,600/μL (normal 3,700–9,700/μL) hemoglobin of 10.4 gm/dL (normal 12.0–15,0 gm/dl), and electrolytes were within normal limits. Blood cultures were not obtained at time of admission.
An MRI of the thoracic spine, performed at the time of presentation, revealed an irregular mass-like density predominantly at the T1 and T2 levels, with a hyper-intense and serpiginous contour demonstrated in the epidural space (Figure ). Spinal cord volume loss due to compression was noted in the upper thoracic segments. Owing to the spinal cord compression and associated neurologic symptoms, an emergent laminectomy was performed. Operative tissue samples were sent for pathology and microbiologic analysis. Histopathology revealed nonspecific chronic, active inflammation. Gram stain of the specimens was negative. Operative wound cultures grew Streptococcus milleri on the 3rd post-operative day. Two sets (2 anaerobic and 2 aerobic collection bottles) of blood cultures obtained upon receiving the results of the wound cultures and prior to initiating antibiotic therapy were negative. Vaginal cultures were not obtained either prior or post-operatively to determine if the patient was colonized with SMG.
The patient was treated with ceftriaxone 2 gm IV daily for 28 days. An MRI of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no focal fluid collections or abscesses. A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no valvular pathology. She was discharged to home after 21 days and was able to ambulate with the assistance of a walker. At the time of hospital discharge, partial improvement in the sensory deficit was noted. Six weeks after initial therapy, residual sensory and motor deficits persisted, requiring the patient to ambulate with the aid of a walker. The patient gave birth to a healthy baby boy by vaginal delivery. Ten months after the initial presentation, the patient was ambulating without a walker and had near complete recovery of both the motor and sensory deficits.","[[25.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['inter-scapular', 'lower extremity', 'both legs', 'urinary', 'bladder', 'bowel', 'cardiopulmonary', 'T4 region below her breasts', 'Ankle', 'Patellar', 'thoracic spine', 'T1 and T2 levels', 'epidural space', 'Spinal cord', 'upper thoracic segments', 'spinal cord', 'neurologic', 'tissue', 'Vaginal', 'abdomen', 'pelvis', 'transesophageal', 'valvular', 'sensory', 'motor', 'vaginal']","['G2P1', 'gestation', 'usual state of good health', 'inter-scapular pain', 'lower extremity paresthesias', 'weakness', 'inability to ambulate', 'fever', 'rigors', 'nausea', 'emesis', 'diarrhea', 'urinary hesitancy', 'loss of bladder control', 'loss of bowel control', 'awake', 'alert', 'oriented', 'cardiopulmonary distress', 'unable to stand or ambulate', 'ascending sensory deficits', 'Ankle reflexes', 'Patellar reflexes', 'Babinski reflexes', 'mass-like density', 'hyper-intense', 'serpiginous contour', 'Spinal cord volume loss', 'compression', 'spinal cord compression', 'neurologic symptoms', 'inflammation', 'Streptococcus milleri', 'colonized', 'colonized with SMG', 'focal fluid collections', 'abscesses', 'valvular pathology', 'able to ambulate', 'sensory deficit', 'sensory and motor deficits', 'deficits', 'ambulate', 'healthy baby boy', 'vaginal delivery', 'ambulating', 'motor and sensory deficits']",['ceftriaxone'],['25'],"['vital signs', 'blood pressure', 'temperature', 'pulse', 'respiratory rate', 'Physical exam', 'laboratory data', 'leukocytosis', 'hemoglobin', 'electrolytes', 'Blood cultures', 'MRI of the thoracic spine', 'emergent laminectomy', 'pathology', 'microbiologic analysis', 'Histopathology', 'Gram stain', 'wound cultures', 'blood cultures', 'wound cultures', 'Vaginal cultures', 'cultures', 'MRI of the abdomen and pelvis', 'transesophageal echocardiogram', 'initial therapy', 'therapy']","['20 weeks', 'until 2 weeks', 'prior to hospital presentation', 'day of admission', 'over the course of 3–4 hours', 'prior to admission', 'prior to admission', 'prior to admission', 'prior to admission', 'prior to admission', '2–3 days', 'prior to admission', 'on the day of admission', 'at time of admission', '3rd post-operative day', 'prior to initiating antibiotic therapy', 'prior or post-operatively', 'prior or post-operatively', '21 days', 'At the time of hospital discharge', 'Six weeks', 'Six weeks', 'Ten months']"

At the end of this exhausting trip he complained of dizziness, finally falling into an 'apathic' state. On the arrival of the emergency physician, the patient suffered from a generalized epileptic seizure. Subsequently, the comatose patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 6 (E 1, V 1, M 4)) developed respiratory insufficiency and cardiovascular failure (blood pressure 60/20 mmHg, heart rate 166/min). He was immediately intubated (using fentanyl (0.3 mg), etomidate (40 mg) and midazolam (20 mg)) and transported to our neurological intensive care unit (NICU).
On admission, the patient was deeply sedated and under analgesia, but still suffering from hypotension requiring immediate use of catecholamines (norepinephrine). The patient had normal weight (body mass index = 24) and no significant previous medical history. The initial cerebral computed tomography (CT) scan in combination with CT angiography did not reveal any pathologies and, to exclude an infectious origin for the central nervous system dysfunction, a lumbar puncture was carried out yielding normal cerebrospinal fluid. An initial extensive laboratory work up revealed impaired liver function (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 312U/l (normal range: 10 to 50 U/l), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 244 U/l (normal range: 10 to 50 U/l), gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 94 U/l (normal range: 10 to 66 U/l) and a prothrombin time of 60% (normal range: 70 to 130%). Serum creatinine levels as well as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were elevated (creatinine 2.6 mg/100 ml (normal range: 0.8 to 1.3 mg/100 ml) and BUN 30 mg/100 ml (normal range: 5 to 25 mg/100 ml)) indicating the beginning of renal failure. This situation was further complicated by rhabdomyolysis with elevation of myoglobin and creatine kinase (CK) (myoglobin peak level 33.124 μg/l (day 2), normal range: 0 to 116 μg/l) and CK peak level 102.4 U/l (day 4), normal range: 38 to 174 U/l.
At the time of admission, core body temperature measured by urinary bladder probe (Foley catheter; Kendall Curity, Mansfield, MA, USA), was 40.8°C. During the first 20 h of treatment, conventional temperature control methods including high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (acetylsalicylic acid 1000 mg and paracetamol 2000 mg) and opioids (pethidine 100 mg), as well as external cooling devices such as cooling blankets (Blanketrol II®, Cincinnati Sub-Zero, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and Bair Hugger® (Arizant Healthcare Inc, Eden Prairie, MN, USA), which were applied for 8 h, did not lead to any significant decrease in core body temperature (Figure ). Because of subsequent deterioration of the patient's condition and insufficient conventional temperature control, an aggressive treatment approach with a novel intravascular cooling system (CoolGard 3000® and Cool Line™, Alsius, Irvine, CA, USA) was begun. The heat-exchange catheter (Cool Line™) was placed into the left superior vena cava and cooled saline was infused through a closed loop system into two heat-exchange balloons located near the distal end of the catheter. The temperature of the saline solution was adjusted automatically by the CoolGard 3000®, which is an external temperature control unit, according to feedback to the external pump/refrigerant device from a microthermister attached to a Foley bladder catheter. Target temperature was set at 37°C for the first 25 h of intravascular treatment and subsequently at 37.5°C. Target temperature was reached within 7 h at a maximum cooling rate of 0.6°C/h and 'cooling' was prolonged at this level.
Multiple organ dysfunction and secondary rhabdomyolysis led to increased levels of myoglobin and CK (myoglobin peak level 33.124 μg/l (day 2), CK peak level 102.4 U/l (day 4)). To prevent imminent renal failure, forced diuresis was initiated and continued for 40 h using high-dose furosemide and fluids, resulting in an urinary excretion rate of more than 400 ml/h, leading to a fluid turnover of up to 24,000 ml/24 h. With this aggressive measure, we suceeded in avoiding the use of extracorporal hemofiltration and the renal parameters returned to normal values within 3 days.
Core body temperature was maintained at about 37°C and subsequently maintained at 37.5°C (± 0.2°C) with the use of the intravascular catheter over the next 5 days (Figure ). Several attempts to stop the active cooling within this period (Figure ) led to an immediate steep increase of core body temperature, which forced us to prolong this very efficacious endovascular treatment. Finally, after 111.5 h, CoolGard® treatment was stopped, since most of the laboratory parameters had stabilized; the patient did not suffer from hyperthermia thereafter.
To confirm the diagnosis of severe heat stroke and to measure the systemic inflammatory response [], we analyzed levels of plasma cytokines and serum chemokines 60 h after admission. The results are shown in Table : soluble interleukin (IL) receptor (sIL-2R) 1500 pg/ml, IL-4 3 pg/ml, IL-6 204 pg/ml, IL-8 40 pg/ml and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) 38 pg/ml (IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha analyzed by immunoenzymometric assay, Biosource, Nivelles, Belgium; IL-2R analyzed by immunoenzymometric assay, Immunotec, Marseille, France). On days 5 and 7 after admission, the values of IL-6 had decreased to 96 pg/ml (day 5) and 34 pg/ml (day 7), respectively.
Initially diagnosed aspiration pneumonia as well as sinusitis maxillaris diagnosed on the initial cerebral CT scan, were treated with tazobactam/piperacilline and clindamycin.

Two months after the surgical intervention she presented to another hospital with syncope. On presentation, it was described that this obese patient was bradycardic with a heart rate of 40 beats per minute with stable blood pressure readings. No jugular venous distention was noted and occasional cannon A waves were noted. Examination of the lungs revealed adequate aeration in all fields with no crackles or wheezing. Point of maximum impulse was not displaced. Regular heart sounds with variable intensity were noted with no atrial or ventricular gallops but an early systolic murmur grade II/VI was described noted at the left sternal border. Due to the symptomatic bradycardia a dual chamber pacemaker was recommended and placed without complications. The patient was subsequently discharged home 24 hours after the pacemaker implantation. Four months post pacemaker implantation she was seen in follow-up and she doing fine and reported no complaints. An echocardiogram was obtained and it was reported that normal left ventricular systolic function as well as prosthetic aortic valve function were noted, with no other abnormalities.
The patient then relocated and was seen a year later for the first time at our institution. An echocardiogram obtained at the time of her initial visit, while still asymptomatic, showed normal left ventricular chamber dimensions, systolic function, and bioprosthetic valve function. In addition, a pacer wire that was correctly positioned in the right ventricular apex was also seen. However, an abnormal color flow signal arising from the interventricular septum with a predominant flow away from the transducer into the left ventricular cavity was noted. Continuous and pulse wave Doppler interrogation demonstrated a continuous flow with a predominant diastolic component, as shown in Figures , and , all these findings consistent with coronary arterial flow. This abnormal color flow signal, traversing the interventricular septum, was never identified in previous studies.
The patient presented in this case was asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis and consequently no intervention was recommended.

There was no history of gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea or vomiting and the bowel habits were normal. There was no history of seizures, mental retardation, behaviour problems, and skin abnormalities suggestive of tuberous sclerosis. She had undergone a caesarean section, seven months back. On examination there was a midline reducible incisional hernia with minimal tenderness in the right iliac fossa.
Computed tomography scan demonstrated an unexplained right iliac fossa density, which could represent a caecal or pericaecal abnormality (figure ). An infraumbilical incisional hernia containing bowel loops was also seen. Colonoscopy showed erythema at the ileo-caecal junction. Biopsies from this area were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of the mass in the right iliac fossa. It was separate from the caecum and lying inferior to it. The differential diagnosis was an inflammatory mass or a pedunculated lesion from the small bowel such as a pedunculated tumour or even a Meckel's diverticulum. Both ovaries were normal. Operative findings were that of a retroperitoneal mass. Excision of the mass was done with repair of the hernia.
Macroscopically, the tumour was well circumscribed with a thin fibrous capsule and the consistency was soft. The cut surface showed lobules of fatty tissue with bands and nodules of firm white tissue with a whorled appearance (figure ).
Microscopic examination (figure ) showed a lesion composed of lobules of mature fatty tissue harbouring multiple variable sized nodules of smooth muscle fibres. The smooth muscle fibres were arranged in broad interlacing fascicles. No cytological atypia was seen and only one mitotic figure was identified in the multiple sections examined and no necrosis. No proliferation of medium-sized arteries with thick muscular walls was observed. The spindle cells were positive for smooth muscle actin and desmin and negative for CD34 and CD117 (figure ). The staining for HMB-45 was not performed, as blocks were not available.

She had no systemic symptoms. A year before, she had had a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Since then, she had been on hormone replacement therapy with estrogen. Six months ago, during her routine follow-up, elevation of transaminase levels was noted. This elevation persisted for the next 6 months. She was then referred to our department for further investigation.
Laboratory features of the patient regarding this period are shown in Table . Detailed questioning of the patient revealed no history of past alcohol abuse. Screening for viral antigens and for antibodies against them, as well as screening for viral nucleotide-acid sequences (including HCV-RNA/-cDNA PCR), found no evidence of infection. Levels of auto-antibodies, serum transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, serum ceruloplasmin, serum copper, serum α1-antitrypsin, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion were either negative or within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography was unremarkable. Doppler ultrasound imaging of portal and hepatic veins and the hepatic artery revealed no thrombosis.
A liver biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed focal necrosis and mild fibrotic activity. Macrovesicular steatosis affecting 5% of hepatocytes, in addition to several foci of prominent nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromasia were also noted. However, the most remarkable finding was the presence of abundant intracytoplasmic, sharply bordered, pale eosinophilic inclusions that exhibited a ground-glass appearance (Figure ). Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), diastase-treated PAS and colloidal iron stains were applied. Immunohistochemistry for hepatitis B surface (mouse monoclonal antibody clone: Tg, Neomarkers) and core (mouse monoclonal antibody clone: Tordji-22, Signet) antigens, α1-antitrypsin (rabbit antibody, Zymed), fibrinogen (rabbit anti-human antibody, Dako), α fetoprotein (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Signet), complement 3 (mouse monoclonal antibody clone: HAV 3–4, Dako) and complement 4 (rabbit anti-human antibody, Dako) were performed. A three-step streptavidin biotin method using AEC as chromogen was applied in the immunohistochemical procedure. The inclusions were negative to PAS and colloidal iron. No reactivity with antibodies against hepatitis antigens, α1-antitrypsin and complement 3 was observed. Diffuse and strong positivity was observed for fibrinogen in cytoplasmic inclusions (Figure ). We also detected less positivity for complement 4 and α-fetoprotein.
Paraffin-embedded tissue was processed for electron microscopic examination. Ultrastructurally, the inclusions were found to be moderately electron-dense, finely granular, homogenous bodies that are encircled by membranes, corresponding to a dilated endoplasmic reticulum (Figure ). There were no parallel arrays of tubular structures in the inclusions.
Serum fibrinogen level was within normal limits. We performed tests for qualitative fibrinogen function. Prothrombine time, partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time were also within normal limits. The patient had no history of prolonged bleeding episodes, menorrhagia, or epistaxis. Since infectious, auto-immune or metabolic diseases were excluded, a drug effect was suspected. Therefore, estrogen therapy was ceased and the patient was followed monthly in order to check transaminase levels. Her serum transaminase levels decreased gradually at each monthly visit and normalized at the third month. Then we decided to perform a control liver biopsy. Parenchymal and portal inflammation, steatosis and necroinflammatory activity were remarkably reduced in the second liver biopsy (Figure ). Again, the same staining procedures were applied. Compared to the first biopsy, fibrinogen positive inclusions decreased dramatically to the point where only one hepatocyte contained an inclusion.

The 2.3 cm invasive carcinoma was well to moderately differentiated with intermediate nuclear grade. Well-formed ducts comprised greater than 90% of the invasive carcinoma (Figure ). In some areas, tumor cells assumed a linear growth pattern and contained intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles (Figure , inset). The invasive carcinoma was estrogen and progesterone receptor positive by immunohistochemistry. Lobular carcinoma in-situ (LCIS), mostly of the classical type with some foci having pleomorphic features and apocrine cytology was also present. In areas, classical LCIS extended into adjacent ducts in a pagetoid distribution. A single axillary lymph node was involved by metastatic carcinoma composed of tumor cells in a diffuse, discohesive pattern characteristic of metastatic lobular carcinoma. Focal gland formation was also evident in this metastatic deposit. Intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles were readily identified within tumor cells.
An E-cadherin immunohistochemical stain was performed on representative samples of invasive, in-situ, and metastatic carcinoma. No cell membrane reactivity was demonstrated in the primary invasive carcinoma or in the nodal metastasis including areas of glandular differentiation (Figure and ).

The lumpectomy specimen contained an 8 mm invasive well-differentiated duct carcinoma. Although greater than 90% of the tumor exhibited glandular differentiation, very focal areas with a single cell and linear growth pattern were also present (Figure ). The invasive carcinoma was estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and negative for HER-2/neu protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. In-situ carcinoma was ductal in type with cribriform architecture and low nuclear grade arising predominantly in a background of typical and atypical columnar cell hyperplasia. Classical LCIS that expanded lobules with central discohesion was also present. The re-excisional specimen revealed additional foci of LCIS and no invasive carcinoma. An ipsilateral sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. The lymph node was involved by metastatic carcinoma with a diffuse, discohesive growth pattern characteristic of lobular carcinoma. A minority of the tumor (<5%) also showed glandular differentiation.
The immunohistochemical stain for E-cadherin showed weak cell membrane reactivity in areas of the primary invasive carcinoma exhibiting a ductal phenotype (Figure ). In contrast, areas of invasive carcinoma with a linear, ""lobular"" phenotype displayed strong, uniform cell membrane staining (not shown). Diffuse, strong and uniform immunoreactivity was also seen in the nodal metastasis (Figure ).
Foci of intraductal carcinoma demonstrated moderate positivity for E-cadherin while those of classical LCIS were negative for this antigen.

Stereotactic needle core biopsy revealed an invasive, moderately differentiated carcinoma that was classified as ductal. Subsequent wide local excision included the needle core biopsy site as well as an area of radiographic density not previously sampled.
The excisional biopsy revealed two separate invasive tumors measuring 8 and 5 mm, respectively. Well-formed glands comprised 80–90% of both tumors. Adjacent classical LCIS was also present. The larger tumor was strongly positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors by immunohistochemistry. No membrane expression for HER-2/neu was appreciated. A single ipsilateral sentinel lymph node contained several cytokeratin-positive cells. Five additional axillary lymph nodes were free of metastatic disease.
The immunohistochemical stain for E-cadherin of the larger tumor was weak and discontinuous (Figure ). There was no E-cadherin cell membrane reactivity in the smaller invasive carcinoma (Figure ) or in adjacent LCIS (not shown). An E-cadherin stain was not performed on the sentinel lymph node.
Aberrant E-cadherin protein expression in this case consisted of predominantly negative immunoreactivity in invasive tumors exhibiting a ductal histological phenotype.
A 57 year-old woman presented with a mass in the left breast.
The excised specimen contained a 2.9 cm invasive and in-situ poorly differentiated carcinoma. More than 90% of the tumor consisted of invasive carcinoma which exhibited predominantly alveolar and solid growth patterns, absence of gland formation, and intermediate-high nuclear grade (Figure , left). In-situ carcinoma comprised the remainder of the tumor mass and had a solid growth pattern, apocrine features, and intermediate-high nuclear grade. Both invasive and in-situ carcinoma formed signet-ring cells containing bluish-tinged, intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles and together with the nuclear atypia, had the appearance of pleomorphic lobular carcinoma. The invasive carcinoma showed nuclear reactivity for estrogen and progesterone receptors by immunohistochemistry. The subsequent left mastectomy specimen revealed residual invasive carcinoma. A single, 2.2 cm left axillary lymph node contained metastatic carcinoma with extranodal extension. Morphologically, the metastatic deposit showed a ""lobular phenotype"" in the form of signet-ring cells growing in a diffuse distribution and absence of glandular differentiation (Figure , left).
An E-cadherin immunohistochemical stain performed on the primary invasive carcinoma revealed a heterogeneous staining pattern. Tumor areas with alveolar and solid growth patterns exhibited strong, continuous cell membrane immunoreactivity (Figure , right) while those having a linear growth pattern had relatively weaker, discontinuous positivity (not shown). Additionally, some tumor cells demonstrated a punctate staining pattern either within the cell membrane or cytoplasm (Figure ). Overall, the E-cadherin reactivity was interpreted as positive in areas of invasive carcinoma despite heterogeneous staining in some areas. Metastatic carcinoma involving the lymph node demonstrated strong, continuous membrane staining (Figure , right).
Aberrant staining in this case consisted of strong E-cadherin protein expression in areas of primary invasive carcinoma morphologically resembling pleomorphic lobular carcinoma. Weaker, discontinuous E-cadherin positivity was observed in other areas of the invasive carcinoma resembling classical type of lobular carcinoma. Punctate membrane or cytoplasmic staining by E-cadherin was also observed in some tumor cells.

The chest X-ray showed total atelectasis of the left lung (Figure ), and the thoracic CT-scan revealed a mass of the left hemithorax, which probably originated in the mediastinum and extended to the whole left pleural space (Figure ). The mass showed heterogeneous density containing soft tissue elements, fat, cystic areas and foci of calcification, which is the classic imaging appearance of a benign teratoma on CT. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to specify the anatomic relationships and confirm the tumor morphologic features. The MRI yielded useful information about the vital structures of the mediastinum, whether invaded or externally compressed by the tumor. Specifically, the MRI confirmed a round, non-homogeneous, well circumscribed mass of a 12 cm diameter, exerting compression on the mediastinum great vessels and the left hilar structures (vessels and airway) (Figure ). The bronchoscopy found stenosis of the trachea by external compression, and narrowing in the foramen of the left main bronchus resulting in difficulty in the insertion of the bronchoscope. The mediastinal tumor markers (α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin) were both normal. As the findings of CT and MRI suggested a benign teratoma, a complete resection was contemplated. Since the mass was supposed to be respectable, surgical management was first in the priority list of therapeutic options. The cytological examination through transcutaneous needle aspiration or biopsy of the tumor were considered redundant and were omitted, because of the dispersion risk and the necessity for total removal so as to ameliorate the respiratory function and re-expand the left lung. Moreover, needle biopsy allows examination of only a small amount of tissue and may be inadequate for definitive diagnosis []. As already underlined in the literature, diagnosis and therapy rely on surgical excision, and even with large sized tumors whose complete resection is impossible, partial resection still relieves symptoms, frequently without relapse []. Pulmonary function tests were impaired: FVC 1.19 (36.7% of predicted) and FEV1 1.01 (41.5% of predicted), whereas a-FP, βCG were normal.
The patient underwent a total resection of the mediastinal mass via a left posterolateral thoracotomy. Entry into the pleural space was performed through the fifth intercostal space, and, because of the tumor large size, extension of the incision was necessary to obtain safe visualization of the cavity and proceed to tumor mobilization. Approaching via left thoracotomy makes access to the mediastinal structures difficult but permits control of the whole hemithorax up to the hilar structures. Many adhesions existed with the left pulmonary artery, the left main bronchus, the pericardium, the aorta, and the diaphragm, and a combination of blunt and sharp dissection for the division was applied uneventfully. Because of difficulty in the mobilization of such a huge mass, a purse string suture permitted aspiration of sebaceous content via a small incision in the wall. As the size diminished, manipulation was facilitated. The tumor, excised en block, was white-gray colored, well circumscribed, and thick capsuled. A tube thoracostomy was introduced, the collapsed left lung was easily re-expanded, and the patient was extubated. The patient recovered well from the operation and was discharged on the 2nd postoperative day. Preoperative atelectasis of the left lung was totally resolved (Figure ), and the pathological examination revealed a benign mature teratoma with dermoid cyst characteristics, containing sebaceous and gelatinous material. Two years later, the patient is doing well out of recurrence.","[[40.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['pulmonary', 'chest', 'left lung', 'thoracic', 'left hemithorax', 'mediastinum', 'whole left pleural space', 'soft tissue', 'vital structures of the mediastinum', 'mediastinum great vessels', 'vessels', 'left hilar structures', 'vessels', 'airway', 'trachea', 'foramen of the left main bronchus', 'mediastinal', 'respiratory', 'left lung', 'tissue', 'Pulmonary', 'mediastinal', 'left posterolateral', 'pleural space', 'fifth intercostal space', 'cavity', 'mediastinal structures', 'whole hemithorax', 'hilar structures', 'left pulmonary artery', 'left main bronchus', 'pericardium', 'aorta', 'diaphragm', 'sebaceous content', 'wall', 'left lung']","['cough', 'dyspnea', 'pulmonary infections', 'total atelectasis of the left lung', 'mass of the left hemithorax', 'mass', 'heterogeneous density', 'soft tissue elements', 'fat', 'cystic areas', 'foci of calcification', 'teratoma', 'tumor morphologic features', 'invaded', 'externally compressed by the tumor', 'mass', 'exerting compression', 'stenosis of the trachea', 'external compression', 'narrowing', 'teratoma', 'mass', 'tumor', 'dispersion', 'ameliorate the respiratory function', 'tumors', 'relieves symptoms', 'relapse', 'mediastinal mass', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'adhesions', 'mass', 'size diminished', 'tumor', 'gray colored', 'well circumscribed', 'thick capsuled', 'recovered well', 'atelectasis of the left lung', 'teratoma', 'dermoid cyst characteristics', 'sebaceous and gelatinous material']",[],['40'],"['chest X-ray', 'thoracic CT-scan', 'CT.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'MRI', 'MRI', 'MRI', 'bronchoscopy', 'mediastinal tumor markers', 'fetoprotein', 'human chorionic gonadotropin', 'CT', 'MRI', 'complete resection', 'surgical management', 'cytological examination', 'transcutaneous needle aspiration', 'biopsy of the tumor', 'total removal', 're-expand the left lung', 'needle biopsy', 'therapy', 'surgical excision', 'complete resection', 'resection', 'partial resection', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'FVC', 'FEV1', 'a-FP', 'total resection of the mediastinal mass via a left posterolateral thoracotomy', 'extension of the incision', 'tumor mobilization', 'left thoracotomy', 'combination of blunt and sharp dissection for the division was applied uneventfully', 'purse string suture permitted aspiration', 'purse string suture permitted aspiration of sebaceous content via a small incision in the wall', 'manipulation was facilitated', 'tumor, excised en block', 'tube thoracostomy was introduced', 'collapsed left lung was easily re-expanded', 'extubated', 'pathological examination']","['previous 2 months', 'Preoperative']"

He denied any history of recent trauma to the hand, fever, weight loss, or other systemic symptoms, but did note an occasional dry cough. He had traveled repeatedly between his native country Ivory Coast, West Africa and the United States. He was not taking antiretroviral medications at the time of presentation. On physical exam his fifth digit was swollen and erythematous at the proximal intraphalangeal joint [figure ]. His laboratory values on admission were as follows: white blood cell count 5000 cells/mm3, hemoglobin 11.6 grams/dl, hematocrit 33.9%, platelets 280,000 platelets/mm3, eosinophils 9.0%, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 60 mm/hour. Left hand radiography was significant for soft tissue swelling over the left finger with joint space narrowing and cortical lucencies with cystic degenerative changes in the proximal phalanx [figure ]. Admission chest radiography demonstrated right hilar lymph node enlargement with multiple scattered nodules and a resolving right lower lobe infiltrate. Computed tomography scan of the chest revealed multiple pulmonary nodules [figure ], necrotic lymph nodes, and splenomegaly. The patient underwent incision, drainage, and biopsy of the affected finger. Operative findings were significant for purulent, mottled, soft, yellow bone.
Rare acid-fast bacilli were demonstrated on biopsy of the both phalanx and synovial fluid samples [figure ]. We used the Gen-PROBE® Amplified Mycobacterium tuberculosis Direct Test which employs a transcription-mediated amplification and hybridization protection assay to qualitatively detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Several weeks later cultures of all surgical material grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis [figure ]. Multiple Ziehl-Neelsen stains of induced sputum samples were negative for acid-fast bacilli, but all specimens sent for sputum culture grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antituberculous treatment was initiated with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrizinamide, and ethambutol prior to culture results.

The patient had suffered from an electrical burn at the age of 5 with delayed and incomplete healing of the wound and subsequent baldness in the healed area. The wound had never been completely healed and ulcerated again 8 weeks before admission to the hospital. The patient, a professor of philosophy, wore a turban for decades to hide the chronic wound. Due to personal neglect and the circumstance that he had been living on his own for many years, without any relatives or a partner kept him from seeing a doctor. The disease only received medical attention when he suddenly experienced a complete aphasia during lectures.
Clinically there was a palpable mass adherent to the skull. Nuclear magnetic resonance and computed tomography imaging revealed a tumour with infiltration of the cranium and the brain (Fig. ). Radical resection of the tumour including the cranium, as well as dura mater and the affected parts of the frontal cortex was performed. The dural defect was closed with an autologous fascia lata patch from the right thigh, and as recipient vessels, the superficial temporal artery and vein were dissected. A radial forearm flap with a 10 × 10 cm skin paddle was harvested with an adequately long vascular pedicle. Radial artery and vein were anastomosed end-to-end to the superficial temporal vessels above the zygomatic arch. The donor site was covered with a split thickness skin graft from the thigh (Fig. ). Histology of the specimen revealed a squamous cell carcinoma and free resectional margins. Postoperative healing was uneventful and the patient regained his speech immediately after the operation (Fig. ). Six weeks later, the patient was referred to our unit again with multiple satellite nodules around the radial forearm free flap (Fig. ). Incision biopsy revealed recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma. In a second operation, radical excision of the scalp with wide margins was performed, requiring sufficient soft tissue coverage. The skin and soft tissue of the radial forearm flap was completely resected, but the proximal part of the radial vessels which were in sufficient distance from the tumour were preserved. Thus radial artery and vein served as recipient vessels for a latissimus dorsi free flap. After the second operation postoperative healing was uneventful again, and the patient recovered well initially for the first three weeks (Fig. and ). Postoperatively, radiation therapy with single focus dose of 14 Gray was administered and one cycle of combined chemotherapy was conducted with cisplatin 180 mg i.v. on day 1 and 5-fluorouracil 1800 mg i.v. on days 1–5 continuously. However despite these efforts, six weeks after the second resection the patient again developed multiple recurrent metastatic lesions around the latissimus dorsi flap, and cerebral symptoms. Clinically, the general condition of the patient dramatically worsened and he died within two more weeks.","[[63.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['scalp', 'healed area', 'skull', 'cranium', 'brain', 'Radical', 'cranium', 'dura mater', 'affected parts of the frontal cortex', 'dural', 'fascia lata', 'right thigh', 'recipient vessels', 'superficial temporal artery', 'vein', 'radial forearm', 'skin', 'Radial artery', 'vein', 'superficial temporal vessels above the zygomatic arch', 'donor site', 'skin', 'thigh', 'radial forearm free flap', 'scalp', 'soft tissue', 'skin', 'soft tissue of the radial forearm flap', 'radial forearm flap', 'proximal part of the radial vessels', 'radial artery', 'vein', 'vessels', 'latissimus dorsi', 'around the latissimus dorsi flap', 'cerebral']","['tumour of the scalp', 'electrical burn', 'wound', 'baldness', 'wound', 'wound', 'disease', 'complete aphasia', 'aphasia', 'mass adherent', 'mass adherent to the skull', 'tumour', 'infiltration', 'tumour', 'dural defect', 'squamous cell carcinoma', 'free resectional margins', 'healing was uneventful', 'regained his speech', 'satellite nodules', 'squamous cell carcinoma', 'sufficient distance from the tumour', 'healing was uneventful', 'recovered well', 'metastatic lesions', 'cerebral symptoms', 'dramatically worsened', 'died']","['cisplatin', 'fluorouracil']","['63', '5', 'professor']","['wore a turban', 'Nuclear magnetic resonance', 'computed tomography imaging', 'Radical resection of the tumour including the cranium', 'dural defect was closed with an autologous fascia lata patch from the right thigh', 'dissected', 'Radial artery and vein were anastomosed end-to-end to the superficial temporal vessels above the zygomatic arch', 'donor site was covered with a split thickness skin graft from the thigh', 'Histology', 'Incision biopsy', 'radical excision of the scalp with wide margins', 'skin and soft tissue of the radial forearm flap was completely resected', 'latissimus dorsi free flap', 'radiation therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'resection']","['8 weeks before admission', 'Postoperative', 'Six weeks later', 'postoperative', 'first three weeks', 'Postoperatively', 'six weeks', 'two more weeks']"

The patient had been treated for lymphoma since 3 months ago. Five days before admission, the patient was treated with the third cycle of CHOP plus rituximab (R-CHOP). She had no history of travel or contact with animals including cows or their products. Physical examination revealed high fever of 39.8°C. The patient had a subclavian cuffed-CVC(Hickman catheter) on the right side with no evidence of the inflammation at the exit site. Laboratory data and chest radiograph were within normal limits. Three sets of blood samples for cultures were drawn through CVC lines (2 sets) and a peripheral vein (1 set), respectively. The patient was treated empirically with vancomycin (1 g every 12 h intravenously). On the second hospital day, all 3 sets of blood cultures grew gram-positive, acid-fast bacilli. The cultures from the CVC became positive more than 2 hours earlier than that from a peripheral vein. Non-pigmented and pinpoint-shaped colonies were observed on blood or chocolate agar plate after 3 days of incubation at 37°C. It did not grow well on McConkey agar plate. As it grows, the color of the colonies becomes pale-yellow. Vancomycin was replaced by imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg every 6 h intravenously) and amikacin (375 mg every 12 h intravenously). On the sixth hospital day, the CVC was removed because of persistent fever. After removal of CVC, the patient became afebrile and the repeated blood cultures became negative. In vitro susceptibility test was performed by broth microdilution test as described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines []. The result of in vitro susceptibility test was shown in Table . The isolates were susceptible to most antimicrobial agents tested except vancomycin.

He kept on working and did not take a shower until > 1 hr later. He developed dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, limb numbness, slurred speech, slow motion, lack of concentration, and ataxia by the next morning, 13 hr after exposure. He was admitted to a local hospital, where a normal brain computerized tomogram was noted. Because of worsening clinical conditions, including “masked” face, irritability, awkwardness, and rocking from side to side while sitting on the bed, he was transferred to our hospital 3 days later. Physical examination revealed some abnormal neurologic findings. The patient was oriented as to time and place but was easily distracted. His speech was slurred. Normal muscle power was noted for all four limbs. He could stand on a wide base with assistance but deviated to both sides when attempting a tandem gait. Impairment on finger-to-nose and heel-to-knee tests was also noted. He denied any medical problems such as hypertension, diabetes, and neurologic diseases. He smoked one pack of cigarettes per day and drank alcohol occasionally.
A routine laboratory work-up including complete blood cell count, electrolytes, blood sugar, and hepatic and renal function tests was performed. Mild hyperventilation, with arterial blood gas of pH 7.510, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 30.6 mm Hg, partial pressure of oxygen 100 mm Hg, and bicarbonate 24.7 mmol/L, was found. No drug history, including use of herbal medicine, was noted for the last 3 months. Urinalysis did not detect any illegal drugs, central nervous system-acting drugs, or other medications. Normal blood and urine lead, mercury, and aluminum levels were also noted.
Eight days after chemical exposure, the patient’s electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Tests of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) for the left-side limbs were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the eighth day showed a symmetric increase in signal intensity on FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery), T2WI (T2-weighted intensity), and DWI (diffusion-weighted images), but low signal intensity on T1WI without postcontrast enhancement at bilateral cerebellar periventricular areas (). A steroid was prescribed for treatment of the possible acute inflammatory effects on neurons. The patient was discharged with stable neurologic function after 6 days of observation.
The pateint was readmitted to our neurology outpatient clinic 18 days after chemical exposure due to difficulty in walking and climbing. Physical examination revealed that the deep tendon reflexes of both knees were areflexic. Muscle power was mildly decreased in the distal and proximal parts of the upper right leg. Lower leg weakness and drop foot were also found bilaterally with muscle power of grade 2/5 in the right foot and 3/5 in the left foot. A nerve conduction study on the 29th day after poisoning showed decreased NCV and complex muscular action potential (CMAP) amplitudes for the left median, left ulnar, left peroneal, and left tibial nerves. H-reflex was absent bilaterally. Sensory conduction and sensory evoked potential tests of the nerves of the upper left and lower left limbs were normal. A brain MRI on the 37th day after poisoning showed that the previous lesions in the cerebellar dentate nuclei region had subsided ().
With active physical therapy, the patient could walk straight on a wide base 2 months after poisoning. No dysmetria was noted on the finger-to-nose test, but heel or toe gait was impaired. The muscle power was grade 3/5 in the flexor and extensor of the right foot; 4/5 in the flexor and extensor of the left foot, and others were all 5/5. Weakness in the flexor and extensor of both feet still remained. A repeat EEG was normal. A repeat NCV study revealed no change in polyneuropathy with motor predominant axonal degeneration.

She underwent an emergency surgical resection of the tumor followed by end sigmoid colostomy and closure of the rectal stump at 10 cm above the anal verge (Hartmann procedure). The pathology was reported as well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid without lymph node metastasis. Her postoperative course was uneventful. Asking for a restorative surgery four months later she was readmitted to the same hospital and operated by the same surgeon. There was no much adhesion in the pelvis and an end-to-end anastomosis was made using a circular stapler (Proximate® 29 mm, Ethicon). She was discharged from the hospital after three weeks. After her return to home she noticed passage of gas and later feces from vagina. She visited the surgeon's clinic again and had a check-up by the gynecologist. The gynecologist did not find her cervix uteri but a defect was found on her posterior vaginal wall five centimeter above the vaginal orifice with feces coming out. The surgeon denied any possibility of removal of her uterus during the surgery. At that point no treatment for rectovaginal fistula was given to the patient. Her case was presented to the medical malpractice committee for evaluation and she came to us to seek further treatment five months after her second operation.
Digital examination of the rectum revealed a 1.5 cm defect on the anterior anal wall 5 centimeters above the anal verge. Vaginal inspection showed three metal clips stapled both the anterior and posterior vaginal wall with small cleavages between the clips. Stool discharged from the vagina. The cervix uteri was not found. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the uterus was present closed to the sacrum. Before this admission she had had a colonoscopy undertaken in a university hospital in Shanghai which reported that the whole colon and the anastomotic site were otherwise normal but a fistula on the anterior rectal wall. The diagnosis of rectovaginal fistula was established and she was operated under epidural anesthesia. Transvaginal repair of rectovaginal fistula was performed. The patient was uneventful until the sixth postoperative day when she passed flatus and stool per vagina but not the rectum. Failure of repair was highly suspected and she was taken into the operation room and had an examination under anesthesia. A blind rectal remnant was found about ten centimeters above the anal orifice and the repaired rectovaginal fistula was all right. Vaginal examination found that after removal of the residual metal clips there was an opening at the anterior fornix of vagina which was three centimeters above the original rectovaginal fistula. The diagnosis of an inadvertent colovaginal anastomosis was established then and a laparotomy was undertaken. After dissection of dense adhesion in the low abdominal cavity and pelvis the uterus was found to be adhered to the sacropromotory and the sigmoid colon was located anteriorly across the left appendix uteri and ended in the anterior cul-de-sac. There was dense adhesion in this area indicating that there has been dissected during the previous surgery. The colovaginal anastomosis was identified by insertion of finger within the vagina. After detachment of the colovaginal anastomosis and repair of the anterior wall of vagina the sigmoid colon was anastomosed to the rectal remnant by a circular stapler (Proximate® 29 mm, Ethicon). Postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged from the hospital eight days after the final operation.

For cardiovascular and prothrombotic risk factors, she had a 25 years history of cigarette smoking (30–35 cigarettes/day), a history of 16 months of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) by oral intake of an estrogen-gestagen combination (Presomen, 0.6 mg/d for 16 months) and untreated hypercholesterolemia (5.90 mmol/L, reference: <5.2 mmol/L). She had no previous medical history of arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or stroke. Duplex sonographic examination of the arterial system of the limbs revealed the acute thromboembolic occlusion of the left popliteal artery. Diagnostic work up was initiated to determine the source of the embolism. The resting ECG and a holter monitoring for 24 h disclosed normal sinus rhythm without any pathologic findings. The transthoracic echocardiographic examination (TTE) showed no structural or functional cardiac abnormalities. Subsequently, a TEE was performed for evaluation of the cardiac cavities and of the thoracic aorta, revealing a large, pedunculated and hypermobile thrombus (Figure , Panl A and B) attached to a non-atherosclerotic aortic wall caudal of the left subclavian artery. CT scans of the thoraco-abdominal aorta (Figure ) confirmed the presence of the thrombus seen in TEE. The entire thoracic aorta had normal dimensions with no visible signs of atherosclerosis. For biochemical laboratory parameters, thrombocytes (530*109/L, reference: <410*109/L), fibrinogen (5.5 g/L, normal: <3.50 g/L) and total Cholesterol (5.90 mmol/L, reference: <5.2 mmol/L) were elevated. All other parameters including glucose (5.8 mmol/L) and homocysteine (8.6 μmol/L) levels were within the reference limit. An extensive serologic survey for hypercoagulability, including antiphospholipid antibodies, and vasculitis disorders was negative.
Because of the high risk for recurrent peripheral embolization due to the size and the hypermobility of the thrombus, the patient was admitted to the vascular surgery unit, where a 15 cm long thrombus in the thoracic aorta with its origin 5 cm distal of the left subclavian artery could be removed. During surgery no macroscopical signs of intimal lesions of the aorta could be detected. Histological evaluation of the thrombus revealed a red, parietal thrombus without any evidence of malignancy. The postoperative course was uneventfull and the patient was discharged 10 days after the surgical intervention. The patient was treated with vitamin-k-antagonist phenprocoumon (INR: 2.5–3.5) for secondary prevention of thromboembolism and with 10 mg/d of atorvastatin for hypercholesterolemia additional to cessation of smoking and oral intake of HRT. On this therapeutic regimen, the patient was asymptomatic with no pathologic findings in the imaging workup at six months follow up.","[[50.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['left foot', 'left popliteal', 'tibialis posterior', 'dorsalis pedis artery', 'cardiovascular', 'cardiovascular', 'heart', 'arterial system of the limbs', 'limbs', 'left popliteal artery', 'cardiac', 'cardiac cavities', 'thoracic aorta', 'aortic wall caudal of the left', 'aortic wall caudal of the left subclavian artery', 'thoracic aorta', 'thoracic aorta', 'origin 5 cm distal of the left subclavian artery', 'aorta', 'parietal']","['pain', 'coldness', 'anesthesia', 'Pulses', 'prothrombotic', 'cigarette smoking', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'arrhythmia', 'ischemic heart disease', 'diabetes mellitus', 'stroke', 'thromboembolic occlusion of the left popliteal artery', 'embolism', 'normal sinus rhythm', 'pathologic findings', 'structural or functional cardiac abnormalities', 'thrombus', 'non-atherosclerotic aortic wall caudal of the left', 'non-atherosclerotic aortic wall caudal of the left subclavian artery', 'thrombus', 'normal dimensions', 'atherosclerosis', 'hypercoagulability', 'antiphospholipid antibodies', 'vasculitis disorders', 'peripheral embolization', 'thrombus', 'thrombus', 'intimal lesions of the aorta', 'parietal thrombus', 'thrombus', 'malignancy', 'uneventfull', 'thromboembolism', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'asymptomatic', 'pathologic findings']","['Presomen', 'vitamin-k-antagonist phenprocoumon', 'atorvastatin']","['50', 'emergency department', 'vascular surgery unit']","['postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy', 'HRT', 'estrogen-gestagen combination', 'Duplex sonographic examination of the arterial system of the limbs', 'Diagnostic work up', 'ECG', 'holter monitoring', 'transthoracic echocardiographic examination (TTE)', 'TEE', 'CT scans of the thoraco-abdominal aorta', 'TEE', 'biochemical laboratory parameters', 'thrombocytes', 'fibrinogen', 'total Cholesterol', 'glucose', 'homocysteine', 'serologic survey', 'surgery', 'Histological evaluation of the thrombus', 'surgical intervention', 'INR', 'cessation of smoking', 'intake of HRT', 'HRT', 'therapeutic regimen', 'imaging workup']","['25 years', '16 months', '16 months', '24 h', '24 h', 'postoperative', '10 days', 'six months']"

Psoriasis, methotrexate and genetic hemochromatosis","A 47 year-old male patient presented to the dermatologist October 1998 following an episode of severe flare up of psoriasis, which he had had for 15 years. His condition improved with coal tar, hydrocortisone ointment and UVB. However, after stopping UVB, his flare up recurred. Methotrexate was introduced to his treatment regime. After a satisfactory baseline blood test and a trial dose of 2.5 mg, he started methotrexate (10 mg/week) in April 1999. Two weeks later the dose was increased to 15 mg/week. In June 1999, the dose was increased to 17.5 mg/week and then back to 15 mg/week in July 1999 with improvement of his psoriasis. There was no history of excess alcohol ingestion.
He had his first liver biopsy, six months later (October 1999) which showed moderate acinar zone 3 and 2 macrovesicular steatosis, with lesser amounts of microvesicular steatosis. Acinar zone 1, grade 1 parenchymal iron accumulation, with an acinar gradient, suggestive of heterozygous form of GH was seen with Perl's Prussian Blue (figure ); iron was not detected in sinusoidal Kupffer cells or macrophages. There was no evidence of fibrosis or, accumulation of copper or alpha 1 anti-trypsin. Genotypic studies confirmed heterozygosity for the HFE gene mutation H63D (in the absence of C282Y).
He had his second liver biopsy in November 2001; total cumulative methotrexate dose of 1.56 gm from his first liver biopsy.

Anastomosis of small intestine was performed in two layers (first runing chromic and second with simple separate silk sutures). On the 10th day after the operation while the patient was on normal diet and had no abdominal symptom or defecation disorder, fecaloid materials were found in urine and drained secretions. Enteropouch and entrocutaneous fistulae were confirmed using oral activated charcoal. The patient was put on fasting and TPN. Antibiotic therapy was initiated, consequently, urinary fecaloid drainage and enterocutoneous fistula improved. However enteropouch fistula remained unresolved even after one month of conservative management. The patient was discharged with free urinary drainage and low residue diet for another month, but the fistula persisted. Upper GI series revealed no pertinent information (fig. ), but pouchogram (fig. ) revealed that the fistula was proximal to the ileocecal junction and most probably on the bowel anastomosis.
Performing surgery, via previous surgical scar (lower midline) all adhesion bands were released and anastomosis (defined by silk sutures) was separated from the pouch, but no fistula was revealed. Thus, with intestine clamped on each side of anastomosis and saline was injected to the lumen, intraluminal pressure increased gradually and fistula appeared by leaking fluid through it.
Fistula repair was done in two layers (after freshing of its edges) in transverse fashion to decrease the risk of stricture. Omentum was interposed between the pouch and fistula without tension. The patient was on TPN and NPO for 5 days and free drainage for two weeks. After two weeks pouchogram was performed and no fistula was seen subsequently the patient was discharged with clean intermittent catheterization. Follow-up up to one year was indicative of favourable outcome.","[[52.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['muscle', 'radical', 'ileal', 'small intestine', 'abdominal', 'Enteropouch', 'entrocutaneous', 'urinary', 'urinary', 'urinary', 'Upper GI', 'proximal to the ileocecal junction', 'ileocecal junction', 'bowel', 'bowel anastomosis', 'pouch', 'intestine', 'anastomosis', 'lumen', 'intraluminal', 'Omentum', 'pouch', 'fistula']","['muscle invasive TCC', 'normal diet', 'abdominal symptom', 'defecation disorder', 'fecaloid materials', 'urine and drained secretions', 'Enteropouch and entrocutaneous fistulae', 'fistulae', 'urinary fecaloid drainage', 'enterocutoneous fistula', 'enteropouch fistula', 'free urinary drainage', 'fistula', 'fistula', 'surgical scar', 'fistula', 'intraluminal pressure increased gradually', 'fistula appeared by leaking fluid', 'leaking fluid', 'Fistula', 'stricture', 'pouch', 'fistula', 'tension', 'fistula']","['activated charcoal', 'saline']",['52'],"['radical cystectomy', 'ileal orthotopic pouch reconstruction', 'Anastomosis of small intestine was performed in two layers', 'operation', 'fasting', 'TPN', 'Antibiotic therapy', 'conservative management', 'low residue diet', 'Upper GI series', 'pouchogram', 'surgery', 'adhesion bands were released', 'anastomosis (defined by silk sutures) was separated from the pouch', 'intestine clamped on each side of anastomosis', 'Fistula repair', 'Fistula repair was done in two layers (after freshing of its edges) in transverse fashion', 'Omentum was interposed between the pouch and fistula without tension', 'TPN', 'NPO', 'free drainage', 'pouchogram', 'catheterization']",['10th day']

She had suffered from intermittent pain located in the right lower quadrant for 2 years, but denied chronic diarrhea. She was diagnosed as having Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum by ileocolonoscopy and histology. An upper gastrointestinal series excluded CD in the upper gastrointestinal tract.
After inductive therapy with azathioprine and corticosteroids, the patient was maintained with mesalazine 500 mg × 4 daily. Prednisone 50 mg/day was added only during acute phases; in the six years following the discharge, 2 episodes of abdominal pain and dyarrhea requiring steroid therapy were recorded. Seven years later the patient was admitted to our Institution for abdominal pain, nausea, iron deficiency anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and intestinal obstruction. On physical examination no masses in the abdomen were noted. Small bowel double-contrast enteroclysis (Fig. ) showed a stricture of the terminal ileum with a thickening of the wall without extravasation of the contrast material. CT scan performed by using intravenous and oral contrast material revealed thickening of the terminal ileum with stranding of the mesenteric fat. There was no clinical evidence of carcinoid tumor so biochemical tests for carcinoid syndrome were not carried out.
At operation, there was a stricturing lesion in the last 6 cm of the terminal ileum with proximal dilation. The wall of the affected ileal loop and caecum was thick and fibrous. Resection of the terminal ileum and caecum was performed. The intestinal continuity was obtained with an end-to-end ileocolic hand-sewn anastomosis.
The surgical specimen included 28 cm of the terminal ileum and caecum. Grossly, all the length of surgical resection showed diffuse thickness of the intestinal wall. There was no evidence of malignancy (Fig. ). Histologically, all resected surgical specimen was characterized by deep ulcers, marked proliferation of small lymph nodules involving all layers of the intestinal wall, sometimes with sarcoid-type granulomas and serosal inflammation. Moreover, two malignancies growing together were found in the ileal loop. The first showed glandular differentiation of large cells with round to oval nuclei sometimes with large nucleoli and abundant pale cytoplasm infiltrating the entire wall (pT2N0M0). The latter consisted of quite uniform medium size cells with round nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli growing in a trabecular or acinar pattern (Fig. ). Only the immunohistochemistry of this latter tumoral population showed strong and diffuse immunoreactivity to neuroendocrine markers such as Chromogranin A and Synaptophisin. All excised mesenteric lymph nodes were negative for malignant cells. The postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged in general good condition. At 18-months follow-up the patient, checked by colonoscopy and ileoscopy was well, free from malignancy relapse or recurrence of CD, and with normal 24-hour urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA).","[[64.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['abdominal', 'right lower quadrant', 'terminal ileum', 'upper gastrointestinal series', 'upper gastrointestinal tract', 'abdominal', 'abdominal', 'intestinal', 'abdomen', 'Small bowel', 'terminal ileum', 'wall', 'terminal ileum', 'mesenteric fat', 'last 6 cm of the terminal ileum', 'wall of the affected ileal loop', 'caecum', 'terminal ileum', 'caecum', 'intestinal', 'ileocolic', '28 cm of the terminal ileum', 'caecum', 'intestinal wall', 'all layers of the intestinal wall', 'serosal', 'ileal loop', 'glandular', 'entire wall', 'mesenteric lymph nodes']","['abdominal pain', 'nausea', 'weight loss', 'constipation', 'pain', 'diarrhea', ""Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum"", 'CD', 'abdominal pain', 'dyarrhea', 'abdominal pain', 'nausea', 'iron deficiency anemia', 'hypoalbuminemia', 'intestinal obstruction', 'masses', 'stricture of the terminal ileum', 'thickening of the wall', 'extravasation of the contrast material', 'thickening of the terminal ileum', 'stranding of the mesenteric fat', 'carcinoid tumor', 'carcinoid syndrome', 'stricturing lesion', 'proximal dilation', 'thick', 'fibrous', 'intestinal continuity', 'surgical specimen', 'thickness of the intestinal wall', 'malignancy', 'deep ulcers', 'lymph nodules', 'granulomas', 'serosal inflammation', 'malignancies', 'glandular differentiation of large cells', 'round to oval nuclei', 'nucleoli', 'cytoplasm infiltrating the entire wall', 'uniform medium size cells', 'medium size cells', 'round nuclei', 'inconspicuous nucleoli growing in a trabecular or acinar pattern', 'immunoreactivity to neuroendocrine markers', 'malignant cells', 'postoperative recovery was uneventful', 'general good condition', 'well', 'malignancy', 'CD', 'normal 24-hour urinary excretion']","['azathioprine', 'mesalazine', 'Prednisone']","['64-year', 'Gastroenterology Unit']","['ileocolonoscopy', 'histology', 'inductive therapy', 'corticosteroids', 'steroid therapy', 'physical examination', 'Small bowel double-contrast enteroclysis', 'CT scan', 'biochemical tests', 'Resection of the terminal ileum and caecum', 'end-to-end ileocolic hand-sewn anastomosis', 'Grossly, all the length of surgical resection', 'resected surgical specimen', 'immunohistochemistry', 'Chromogranin A', 'Synaptophisin', 'excised mesenteric lymph nodes', 'colonoscopy', 'ileoscopy', 'urinary excretion', '5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid', '5-HIAA']",['2 years']

Her personal anamnesis revealed three early pregnancy loss within 8 and 12 week of gestation and one extrauterine pregnancy. The patient did not revealed previous thromboembolic disease (arterial or venous) nor haemorragic disorders; moreover patient was not ongoing any type of pharmacological treatment. A thorough familial anamnesis did not show a trend toward thromboembolic and/or haemorragic disease.
To understand pathophysiology of her RPL the patient performed several laboratory and instrumental tests.
A normal ovarian function and ovulation were detected by normal values of Follicle-stimulating Hormone, Luteinising Hormone, oestradiol and progesterone and by ovarian ultrasound scan (data not shown). Uterine and salpinxes malformation was excluded by hysterosalpingography and hysteroscopy (data not shown). Endocrinological diseases such as diabetes and dysthyroidism were evaluated and excluded by normal values of glycaemia, thriiodothyronine (i.e. FT3), thyroxine (i.e. FT4) and Thyroid-stimulating Hormone (data not shown). Inflammatory chronic diseases were excluded by normal values of erythro-sedimentation rate and acute phase C reactive protein and immunopathological chronic disease, such as erytematosus systemic lupus, by normal level of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anitmithocondrial antibodies (AMA) and smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) too (data not shown); moreover patient did not suffer of chronic joint paint or fever or other related symptoms.
Yet, routine haemostatic tests showed normal value of prothrombin time, measured as International Normalised Ratio (PT INR, 1.15) and a prolonged activated thromboplastin time, measured as ratio (aPTT, 1.45) (table ). To confirm this laboratory alteration, after 15 days a second step of haemostatic parameters were tested and confirmed normal value of PT INR and prolonged aPTT (1.46, table and ), associated to normal levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (tested by an ELISA method; IgM 1.7 U/MPL and IgG 3.9 U/GPL) (table and ), fibrinogen and clotting factors V, VIII, IX, X, XI (table1), while a reduced plasmatic level of clotting factor XII was detected (65%, table and ). So, we tested for aPTT and factor XII first degree relatives (i.e. one sister and parents) but did not find alterations (data not shown). Yet, lupus anticoagulant and antibodies to β-2-glycoprotein I were absent (table and ). Furthermore, because RPL was associated to reduced clotting inhibitors also protein C, protein S and antithrombin III were analysed and resulted in normal range (table ) such as inherited thrombophilia associated to Factor V Leiden and prothrombin A20210G gene polymorphisms (table ). Moreover, to confirm factor XII deficiency, after one month the patient was evaluated again and results showed again prolonged aPTT (1.48), reduced factor XII (55%). So, we tested aPTT adding to the plasma patient's a normal plasma sample with a ratio of plasma patient's to pool plasma 1/1 v/v; results revealed a partial correction of aPTT (1.30) suggesting a possible presence of an acquired clotting inhibitor and/or antiphospholipid antibodies. A new evaluation of common antiphospholipid antibodies began with normal levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (tested again with an ELISA method; IgM 1.5 and IgG 3.8) and absence of antibodies to β-2-Glycoprotein I, but a positivity for lupus anticoagulant was detected (table ). Lupus anticoagulant was assayed according to recommendations of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Furthermore, at this time we tested again ANA that resulted again negative. Finally, because a transient positivity of lupus anticoagulant has been associated with factor XII deficiency in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome in rare cases [,], after one month the patient was evaluated one more time and in this time also antibodies to clotting factor XII were evaluated by an ELISA method. Results showed prolonged aPTT (1.44), reduced factor XII plasma levels (43%), normal range of anticardiolipin antibodies (IgM and IgG), absence of antibodies to β-2-Glycoprotein I, negativity for lupus anticoagulant, while antibodies to factor XII have been detected (table ). So, according to our data and data available in the Literature the patient was diagnosed an unusual form of primary antiphospholipid syndrome and an antithrombotic treatment was suggested.","[[34.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['extrauterine', 'arterial', 'venous', 'ovarian', 'ovarian', 'Uterine', 'salpinxes', 'joint']","['pregnancy loss', 'gestation', 'extrauterine pregnancy', 'thromboembolic disease', 'haemorragic disorders', 'thromboembolic', 'haemorragic disease', 'RPL', 'normal ovarian function and ovulation', 'malformation', 'Endocrinological diseases', 'diabetes', 'dysthyroidism', 'Inflammatory chronic diseases', 'joint paint', 'fever', 'symptoms', 'alterations', 'lupus anticoagulant', 'RPL', 'reduced clotting inhibitors', 'inherited thrombophilia', 'Factor V Leiden', 'prothrombin A20210G gene polymorphisms', 'factor XII deficiency', 'acquired clotting inhibitor', 'antiphospholipid antibodies', 'lupus anticoagulant', 'lupus anticoagulant', 'factor XII deficiency', 'antiphospholipid syndrome', 'lupus anticoagulant', 'primary antiphospholipid syndrome']",[],"['34', 'Sterility Center', 'ANA']","['personal anamnesis', 'pharmacological treatment', 'familial anamnesis', 'laboratory', 'instrumental tests', 'Follicle-stimulating Hormone', 'Luteinising Hormone', 'oestradiol', 'progesterone', 'ovarian ultrasound scan', 'hysterosalpingography', 'hysteroscopy', 'glycaemia', 'thriiodothyronine', 'FT3', 'thyroxine', 'FT4', 'Thyroid-stimulating Hormone', 'erythro-sedimentation rate', 'acute phase C reactive protein', 'immunopathological chronic disease', 'erytematosus systemic lupus', 'antinuclear antibodies (ANA)', 'anitmithocondrial antibodies (AMA)', 'smooth muscle antibodies', 'SMA', 'haemostatic tests', 'prothrombin time', 'International Normalised Ratio', 'PT INR', 'prolonged activated thromboplastin', 'prolonged activated thromboplastin time', 'aPTT', 'laboratory alteration', 'haemostatic parameters', 'PT', 'PT INR', 'INR', 'prolonged aPTT', 'anticardiolipin antibodies', 'IgM', 'IgG', 'fibrinogen', 'clotting factors V, VIII, IX, X', 'clotting factors V, VIII, IX, X, XI', 'plasmatic level of clotting factor XII', 'aPTT', 'factor XII', 'clotting inhibitors', 'protein C', 'protein S', 'antithrombin III', 'prolonged aPTT', 'reduced factor XII', 'aPTT', 'plasma', 'plasma sample', 'plasma', 'pool plasma', 'aPTT', 'common antiphospholipid antibodies', 'common antiphospholipid antibodies', 'anticardiolipin', 'anticardiolipin antibodies', 'ELISA', 'IgM', 'IgG', 'lupus anticoagulant', 'Lupus anticoagulant', 'ANA', 'antibodies to clotting factor XII', 'ELISA', 'prolonged aPTT', 'aPTT', 'factor XII', 'factor XII plasma levels', 'anticardiolipin antibodies (IgM and IgG)', 'lupus anticoagulant', 'antibodies to factor XII', 'antithrombotic treatment']","['8 and 12 week', 'in this time']"

She had a significant psychiatric history with multiple episodes of self harm and had previously been hospitalised with behavioural problems. The patient had a history of multiple admissions with cardiac sounding chest pain, all with normal ECG and cardiac troponin levels. An outpatient stress nuclear perfusion scan was normal. The patient also had a history of arterial hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was managed on a combination of amitriptyline, losartan, amlodipine and flecainide. During this admission she repeatedly denied taking an overdose.
On admission to the emergency room the patient was unresponsive with a GCS of 6. She rapidly regained consciousness but remained slightly drowsy. Pupil response was normal. Her pulse was 70 bpm and blood pressure 60/40 mmHg. The 12-lead ECG (figure ) revealed atrial fibrillation with a broad QRS complex (320 ms) with a sine wave appearance. An ECG had been performed 4 weeks previously and was normal. She had normal serum potassium (4.1 mmol/l). The presentation with chest pain led to a presumptive diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction and she was treated with thrombolysis with intravenous alteplase. Ten minutes later there was a significant change in her ECG (figure ). Inotropic support was instituted with dobutamine and subsequently with adrenaline to maintain her blood pressure. She remained hypotensive with poor urine output and was transferred to the regional cardiothoracic unit for further management. Blood was taken for paracetamol, salicylate levels which were normal. Flecanide levels were requested. Blood gases showed pH 7.37, pCO2 6.1kPa, pO2 11.7, bicarbonate 25.3 mmol/l
On arrival at our institution, transthoracic echocardiography revealed global moderate impairment of left ventricular function. Emergency coronary angiography was performed demonstrating normal epicardial coronary arteries and left ventriculography confirmed the echocardiography findings. An intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted with a rapid improvement in haemodynamics. Over the following 48 hours the patient was weaned from the inotropes and the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed. During this period her QRS duration gradually returned to normal (figure ) with left axis deviation and first degree heart block (which was present 12 months previously). Repeat echocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricular function.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an enhancing cystic lesion in the left temporal lobe. A partial resection of the left temporal mass, revealed a malignant neoplasm on frozen section and on final pathological evaluation, a diagnosis of GBM was made. Immunohistochemical results showed positive staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and no evidence of positive staining for cytokeratin. The patient received adjuvant external beam radiation therapy.
Approximately nine months later the patient returned with both speech and short-term memory problems. MRI revealed tumor recurrence in the left temporal area. Stereotactic biopsy demonstrated a necrotic tumor consistent with GBM on frozen section, a diagnosis confirmed on permanent sections. The stereotactic biopsy was followed by intraoperative injection of the chemotherapeutic agent DTI-015 []. Three months later, the patient returned with a 2.0 cm subcutaneous mass in the left parietal scalp, approximately six centimeters from the closest postoperative scar. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the left parietal scalp mass revealed a GBM. The lesion was excised a month later with histological confirmation of the diagnosis. Following excision of the scalp mass, a repeat MRI documented progression of the primary tumor. The patient died of pulmonary embolism one month after excision of the scalp mass.
FNA biopsy of the palpable left parietal subcutaneous scalp mass was performed by a pathologist, using a 23 gauge needle. Four smears and one cell block were prepared. The air dried smears were stained with a modified Wright stain (Diff-Quik®); the 95% ethanol fixed smears were stained with the Papanicolaou stain.
The smears were abundantly cellular with atypical cells arranged in loosely cohesive clusters, ranging from 5 to 40 cells per cluster, with overlapping nuclei (Fig. ). Scattered atypical mitoses were also present (Fig. ). Morphologically, the cells were polygonal to spindle-shaped with increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, moderate nuclear pleomorphism, coarsely clumped hyperchromatic chromatin, irregular nuclear membranes, and distinct nucleoli. Binucleated and multinucleated cells were also noted. A few scattered intranuclear inclusions were present (Fig. ). Fibrillary processes extending from the atypical cells were apparent. A tumor diathesis consisting of neutrophils, degenerated cells, necrotic debris, a few lymphocytes, and bare nuclei made up the background. The cell block showed similar findings as well as characteristic necrotic foci surrounded by palisading spindle-shaped atypical cells (geographic necrosis) (Fig. ). Immunohistochemically, the atypical cells displayed strong reactivity for GFAP (Fig. ) and vimentin with no reactivity for CD45, cytokeratin, and HMB-45, supporting the diagnosis of GBM.

286,1325236-1,16336642,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1325236.xml,Coxiella burnetii vascular graft infection,"A 63-year-old man presented to a regional hospital on September 8, 2003 with a 2-week history of diffuse abdominal pain and mild diarrhea, without fever. In 1988, he had received a Dacron aorto-bifemoral graft for an infra-renal aortic aneurysm. A computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a para-prosthetic fluid collection. Blood cultures were sterile in the absence of any recent antibiotic therapy. Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 5.8 G/l, a CRP of 48 mg/l, no increase of liver enzymes and a normal serum creatinine level. Empirical ciprofloxacin and metronidazole therapy was initiated and abdominal pain improved.
After two months of antibiotic therapy, the patient was admitted to the University Hospital in Lausanne for removal of the vascular prosthesis because of presumed persistent infection, despite two months of antibiotic treatment. On admission, the patient was afebrile. Clinical examination was normal except for mild periumbilical tenderness on deep palpation. Laboratory results showed a normal WBC count (4.9 G/l), a normal CRP (<2 mg/l), and normal renal and liver functions. At laparotomy, extensive adhesions and a right para-iliac purulent mass were found. The prosthetic graft was partially removed, and replaced by a homograft. Multiple intra-operative specimens did not grow any microorganisms in culture. Histopathology showed a chronic inflammatory infiltrate, ill-formed non-necrotizing granulomas, and degenerative changes such as calcifications and fibrosis (Figure &). No microorganisms could be identified using Periodic acid-Schiff, Gram, Grocott methenamine silver and Giemsa stains.
16S rRNA PCR amplification plus sequencing performed on a fragment of the para-iliac mass was positive for Coxiella burnetii, using the BAK11w forward and the PC3mod reverse primers []. The diagnosis of C. burnetii chronic infection was confirmed by a positive serology performed at Unité des Rickettsies, Marseille, France: phase I antibody titer (IgG): 1600, phase II antibody titer (IgG): 3200. Antibiotic therapy with doxycycline (100 mg bid orally) and chloroquine (200 mg tid orally) was started. The dose of doxycycline was increased to 300 mg daily to reach a concentration of at least 5 μg/mL []. Eighteen months later (May 2005), the patient was asymptomatic and serology showed persistence of high levels of phase I IgG (1600) and phase II IgG (3200).
C. burnetii is a strict intracellular bacterium. It is the causative agent of Q fever, a worldwide zoonosis mainly transmitted by inhalation of infected particles. There is a wide animal reservoir, and sheep and cattle are probably the main source of human infections. Our patient had no environmental exposure to C. burnetii. Chronic Q fever is mainly seen in patients with underlying risk factors such as valvulopathy, pregnancy, and immunosuppression. Endocarditis accounts for 73% of chronic Q fever cases, followed by vascular infection (8%), including infections of aneurysms and vascular grafts [,]. Given the significant morbidity and mortality of vascular infection, and given the importance of targeted and prolonged antibiotic therapy, the diagnosis of C. burnetii infection is crucial to a successful therapeutic outcome. We report here a rare case of C. burnetii vascular graft infection. This unexpected diagnosis was based on broad-range PCR. Q fever is probably underdiagnosed since the diagnosis will be missed if it is not systematically looked for in patients with vascular graft infections of unknown etiology.
The diagnosis of Q fever is most frequently made by serology. C. burnetii presents a variation of phase (phases I and II). Antiphase I IgG at titers of ≥1:800 by microimmunofluorescence are indicative of chronic Q fever [,]. The diagnosis has also be made using molecular methods including 16S rRNA PCR amplification plus sequencing or a specific C. burnetii PCR. To shorten the diagnostic delay, Fenollar et al. developed a nested-PCR assay with serum as a template which showed a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 100% []. In the present case, 16s rRNA PCR amplification plus sequencing was critical for diagnosis, since Q fever had not been suspected clinically. Broad-range PCR was also recently shown to be useful for the diagnosis of blood culture-negative infectious endocarditis, identifying an etiological agent in 35.5% of cases (11/31), including 3 cases due to C. burnetii []. The histology of Q fever endocarditis is non-specific and is characterized by fibrosis and calcifications, mild inflammation, and small or absent vegetations. Brouqui et al. observed a granulomatous inflammation in one third of cases with Q fever endocarditis, but well formed granuloma were not identified. In these cases, degenerative changes such as valvular calcifications or foreign body reaction prevented the establishment of a specific association between C. burnetii infection and granulomatous inflammation []. The presence of foamy macrophages, also observed in our case, may suggest a Coxiella infection. Definite histological diagnosis relies upon immunohistology, that may demonstrate the presence of C. burnetii within the cytoplasm of macrophages []. However, this diagnostic method is less sensitive than PCR []. Thus, immunohistology is unlikely to be a useful tool for the diagnosis of C. burnetii vascular graft infection. Cell culture is not widely available as a diagnostic technique as it requires trained technicians and a biosafety level 3 laboratory.
Tetracyclines are the antibiotics of choice for acute Q fever []. The bactericidal activity of doxycycline is maximal at pH 6.6. However, the Coxiella-containing vacuole is acidic. Therefore, addition of chloroquine that acts as an alkalinizing agent of the vacuole is essential to improve the efficacy of doxycycline therapy []. Combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine for at least 18 months is the recommended therapy for Q fever endocarditis []. This combined treatment is probably also indicated in case of C. burnetii vascular graft infection. Since serum doxycycline concentration is correlated with decrease in levels of phase I antibodies, it is recommended to adjust the dosage of doxycycline []. Patients are considered cured when phase I IgG antibodies decrease below 1:800, and IgA and IgM antibodies below 1:50 []. In this case, after 18 months of therapy, antiphase I serology remains strongly positive suggesting persistent infection most likely due to the fact that the infected prosthesis could only be partially removed. It also shows how difficult it is to eradicate C. burnetii and emphasizes the need for prolonged antibiotic treatment course. Serological follow-up will guide our decision regarding the treatment duration.","[[63.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['abdominal', 'aorto-bifemoral', 'infra-renal aortic', 'abdomen', 'liver', 'abdominal', 'periumbilical', 'renal', 'liver', 'right para-iliac', 'fragment of the para-iliac mass', 'valvular', 'cytoplasm of macrophages']","['abdominal pain', 'diarrhea', 'fever', 'infra-renal aortic aneurysm', 'para-prosthetic fluid collection', 'increase of liver enzymes', 'normal serum creatinine level', 'abdominal pain', 'infection', 'afebrile', 'periumbilical tenderness', 'normal renal and liver functions', 'adhesions', 'right para-iliac purulent mass', 'microorganisms', 'inflammatory infiltrate', 'granulomas', 'degenerative changes', 'calcifications', 'fibrosis', 'microorganisms', 'Coxiella burnetii', 'C. burnetii', 'asymptomatic', 'C. burnetii', 'Q fever', 'worldwide zoonosis', 'inhalation of infected particles', 'environmental exposure to C. burnetii', 'C. burnetii', 'Q fever', 'valvulopathy', 'pregnancy', 'immunosuppression', 'Endocarditis', 'Q fever', 'vascular infection', 'infections of aneurysms', 'infections of aneurysms and vascular grafts', 'vascular grafts', 'morbidity and mortality of vascular infection', 'C. burnetii infection', 'therapeutic outcome', 'C. burnetii vascular graft infection', 'Q fever', 'vascular graft infections', 'Q fever', 'C. burnetii', 'Q fever', 'Q fever', 'infectious endocarditis', 'C. burnetii', 'Q fever endocarditis', 'fibrosis', 'calcifications', 'inflammation', 'vegetations', 'granulomatous inflammation', 'Q fever endocarditis', 'granuloma', 'degenerative changes', 'valvular calcifications', 'foreign body reaction', 'C. burnetii infection', 'granulomatous inflammation', 'foamy macrophages', 'Coxiella infection', 'C. burnetii', 'C. burnetii vascular graft infection', 'Q fever', 'bactericidal activity of doxycycline is maximal', 'Coxiella-containing vacuole is acidic', 'alkalinizing agent of the vacuole', 'vacuole', 'Q fever endocarditis', 'C. burnetii vascular graft infection', 'infection', 'infected prosthesis', 'removed', 'C. burnetii']","['ciprofloxacin', 'metronidazole', 'doxycycline', 'chloroquine', 'doxycycline', 'Tetracyclines', 'chloroquine', 'doxycycline', 'doxycycline', 'hydroxychloroquine', 'doxycycline']","['63', 'regional hospital', 'September 8, 2003', '1988', 'University Hospital', 'Lausanne', 'Unité des Rickettsies, Marseille, France', 'May 2005', 'C. burnetii', '11/31']","['Dacron aorto-bifemoral graft', 'computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen', 'Blood cultures', 'antibiotic therapy', 'Laboratory', 'white blood cell count', 'CRP', 'liver enzymes', 'serum', 'serum creatinine level', 'antibiotic therapy', 'removal of the vascular prosthesis', 'antibiotic treatment', 'Clinical examination', 'Laboratory', 'WBC count', 'CRP', 'functions', 'laparotomy', 'prosthetic graft was partially removed', 'replaced by a homograft', 'culture', 'Histopathology', 'Periodic acid-Schiff', 'Gram', 'Grocott methenamine silver', 'Giemsa stains', '16S rRNA PCR amplification plus sequencing', 'serology', 'antibody titer (IgG)', 'antibody titer (IgG)', 'Antibiotic therapy', 'serology', 'antibiotic therapy', 'broad-range PCR', 'serology', 'Antiphase I IgG at titers', 'microimmunofluorescence', '16S rRNA PCR amplification plus sequencing', 'C. burnetii PCR', 'nested-PCR assay', 'nested-PCR assay with serum', 'serum', 'sensitivity', 'specificity', '16s rRNA PCR amplification plus sequencing', 'Broad-range PCR', 'blood culture-negative', 'immunohistology', 'PCR', 'immunohistology', 'Cell culture', 'antibiotics', 'pH', 'therapy', 'combined treatment', 'serum doxycycline concentration', 'levels of phase I antibodies', 'phase I IgG antibodies', 'IgA and IgM antibodies', 'therapy', 'antiphase I serology', 'partially removed', 'antibiotic treatment', 'Serological']","['2-week', 'Eighteen months later', 'May 2005']"

The lump was non tender and had not changed in size. He complained of weight loss of 5 kg over the past two months. He denied foreign travel, night sweats, recent injury, cough, or the presence of any other lumps. His past medical history was unremarkable. There was no family history of breast or bowel cancer. The lump was clinically palpable and measured 3 cm. It was firm, non tender, not attached to the skin or deep tissues and was consistent with a clinical diagnosis of axillary lymphadenopathy. The left axilla and supraclavicular fossae were normal. There was no skin lesion in the drainage area of the axilla. Examination of the breasts, chest and abdomen were unremarkable. Haematology, Biochemistry and Chest X-rays were normal. Ultrasound confirmed a benign appearing lymph node with a fatty centre. In view of the size and longstanding nature of the lymph node, an excision biopsy was performed. At surgery the node was firm, suspicious and black in colour.
On histology, the specimen of the lymph node with attached fatty tissue measured 3 × 2 × 0.8 cms. Black discolouration was present on the cut surface.
Microscopic examination of the routine haematoxylin and eosin sections of the lymph node showed preservation of architecture with follicular hyperplasia. Black carbon like pigment was seen lying within the macrophages and dispersed outside them in the sinuses. There was associated fibrosis. Multiple sections did not reveal any evidence of metastatic malignant melanoma.
Immunohistochemical staining for S 100 protein and histochemical stain (Masson's Fontana) was done to further exclude that possibility.

She was treated with modified radical mastectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil, followed by adjuvant hormonal therapy. She completed five years of adjuvant tamoxifen in 2003 and and was started on letrozole adjuvant therapy in January 2004 [].
The patient had an ocular history significant for bilateral dacryocystitis, cataracts and open angle glaucoma, left dacryocystectomy (DCR) in 1997, right DCR in 2000 and 2003, as well as a right eye phacoemulsification with implantation of a hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lens in 2003 with a postoperative uncorrected visual acuity of 20/25. The patient was maintained on antiglaucoma treatment in the form of topical beta blocker eyedrops for both eyes, combined with prostaglandin eyedrops for her left eye.
The patient was scheduled to have zoledronic acid 4 mg once every six months for osteoporosis. In August 2004, the patient was given intravenous hydration with normal saline, premedicated with paracetamol, and had an intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid 4 mg in 100 cc normal saline given over 30 minutes. The patient did well throughout the infusion; however, she felt chilly and feverish overnight. The next day, she presented to the Emergency Department complaining of severe right eye pain and decreased vision. Examination revealed uncorrected visual acuity of 20/100 in the right eye and 20/60 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in both eyes. Slit lamp examination revealed marked ciliary injection of the right eye, and a 2+ flare and inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber. An inflammatory fibrinous pupillary membrane was also present (Fig ). Fundus examination was normal. A diagnosis of right anterior uveitis was made. The patient was placed on topical prednisone every 6 hours, and atropine eyedrops every 12 hours. She responded well to the treatment which was gradually tapered off over a period of 6 weeks without recurrence of uveitis. Following treatment, visual acuity in the right eye improved to 20/30, and slit lamp examination revealed slight opacification of the posterior capsule (Fig ), and residual pigmented deposits on the surface of the intraocular lens (Fig ). These inflammatory changes and deposits on the posterior lens surface disappeared on their own over a period of 3 months, but residual posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is still present. This PCO has no effect on the patient's visual acuity at present and doesn't require any intervention.

She had no history of hypertension, cigarette smoking, alcohol ingestion, weight loss, fractures or fever. Her medical history was significant for intermittent claudication.
Physical examination showed a thin woman (body mass index of 17 kg/m2) with a hard, irregular, painless, mobile tumoration on the anterior surface of the neck. No lymph nodes were palpable and hoarseness was evident. There was no craniofacial abnormality. The results of oral cavity, thyroid, cardiopulmonary and abdominal examination were unremarkable. The femoral arteries appeared to be thickened and pulses were frail although there were no signs of acute limb ischemia.
Pelvic and lower extremity roentgenograms showed dense, ""rail tracking"" femoral artery calcification associated with near-total obstruction of these vessels confirmed by translumbar aortography (figure ). A neck X-ray and computed tomography evidenced grossly calcified areas of soft tissue in the topography of the pharynx and larynx. Direct laryngoscopy confirmed exophytic calcic deposits in the left pyriform sinus (figure and ). No other images of abnormal calcifications were found at any other sites, such as the arms, lung, heart, aorta or abdomen. A bone scintigram showed increased uptake of 99 mTc-methylene diphosphate in the calcified femoral arteries and on the anterior surface of the neck (figure ). Right hip and lumbar spine bone densitometry evidenced supportive findings of osteoporosis. Chest X-ray revealed mild enlargement of cardiac area associated with ectasic thoracic aorta; pulmonary aspects were normal. Doppler echocardiography revealed mild pulmonary hypertension (39 mmHg) associated with mild left atrium and moderate left ventricle enlargement; there was a diffuse left ventricle hypokinesia associated with an ejection fraction of 32% (indirectly measured by echocardiography). Also, there was an eccentrical left ventricular hypertrophy, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. There was no abnormality in the right ventricle. Cineangiocoronariography was attempted to directly analyse any coronary disease as a possible cause of these abnormalities, but the rigidity of femoral and brachial arteries impeded the insertion of the catheter.
Sleep variables obtained from polysomnography were indicative of severe OSA (table ) with an apnea/hypopnea index of 51.6 per hour (40.9 apnea episodes/h), 89% of which occurred together with bradycardia and extra beats. Minimal oxygen saturation was 88%. The spirometric study demonstrated mild obstructive airway disease with no responsiveness after bronchodilator test. Also, there was a moderate decrease in the pulmonary diffusion capacity (Collins GS Plus Modular System, Warren E Collins Inc. Braintree, MA).
Except for the impaired fasting glucose state (fasting blood glucose of 117 mg/dl), there were no other biochemical abnormalities concerning calcium, phosphate, magnesium, creatinine and parathyroid hormone. Clinical and laboratory findings excluded any kind of rheumatologic disease such as dermatomyositis, scleroderma or systemic lupus erythematosus. Biopsy specimens from the pharynx and temporal artery revealed soft tissue calcification and medial artery calcinosis, respectively (Figure ).
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) tritation for treatment of such obstructive sleep apnea has been tried twice on different occasions, but the patient has complained of extreme discomfort (she could hardly sleep during the procedures). A pressure of 10 cm H2O was reached during some short periods of sleep with a very low effect on the frequency of episodes of apnea. So, with the aim of stopping further vascular and soft tissue calcification, intravenous dissodic pamidronate was administred (60 mg IV diluted in 250 mL of saline solution once a day for 1 day).","[[63.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['anterior portion of the neck', 'anterior surface of the neck', 'lymph nodes', 'craniofacial', 'oral cavity', 'thyroid', 'cardiopulmonary', 'abdominal', 'femoral arteries', 'limb', 'Pelvic', 'lower extremity', 'femoral artery', 'vessels', 'translumbar', 'neck', 'soft tissue', 'pharynx', 'larynx', 'left pyriform sinus', 'arms', 'lung', 'heart', 'aorta', 'abdomen', 'bone', 'calcified femoral arteries', 'femoral arteries', 'anterior surface of the neck', 'Right hip', 'lumbar spine bone', 'Chest', 'cardiac area', 'thoracic aorta', 'pulmonary aspects', 'pulmonary', 'left atrium', 'left ventricle', 'left ventricle', 'eccentrical left ventricular', 'mitral', 'tricuspid', 'right ventricle', 'coronary', 'femoral', 'brachial arteries', 'airway', 'pulmonary', 'pharynx', 'temporal artery', 'soft tissue', 'medial artery', 'soft tissue']","['increasing size of the anterior portion of the neck', 'dyspnea', 'snoring', 'coughing', 'dysphagia of solids', 'sleepiness', 'hypertension', 'cigarette smoking', 'alcohol ingestion', 'weight', 'weight loss', 'fractures', 'fever', 'claudication', 'tumoration', 'palpable', 'hoarseness', 'craniofacial abnormality', 'unremarkable', 'thickened', 'pulses were frail', 'limb ischemia', 'femoral artery calcification', 'near-total obstruction of these vessels', 'calcified areas of soft tissue', 'exophytic calcic deposits', 'abnormal calcifications', 'increased uptake of 99 mTc-methylene diphosphate', 'osteoporosis', 'enlargement of cardiac area', 'ectasic thoracic aorta', 'pulmonary aspects were normal', 'pulmonary hypertension', 'enlargement', 'left ventricle hypokinesia', 'eccentrical left ventricular hypertrophy', 'regurgitation', 'abnormality', 'coronary disease', 'abnormalities', 'rigidity of femoral and brachial arteries', 'impeded the insertion of the catheter', 'OSA', 'bradycardia', 'extra beats', 'obstructive airway disease', 'responsiveness', 'decrease in the pulmonary diffusion capacity', 'impaired fasting glucose state', 'biochemical abnormalities', 'rheumatologic disease', 'dermatomyositis', 'scleroderma', 'systemic lupus erythematosus', 'soft tissue calcification', 'medial artery calcinosis', 'obstructive sleep apnea', 'discomfort', 'hardly sleep', 'apnea', 'calcification']","['pamidronate', 'saline']","['63', 'Warren E Collins']","['Physical examination', 'body mass index', 'Pelvic and lower extremity roentgenograms', 'translumbar aortography', 'neck X-ray', 'computed tomography', 'topography of the pharynx and larynx', 'Direct laryngoscopy', 'bone scintigram', 'Right hip and lumbar spine bone densitometry', 'Chest X-ray', 'Doppler echocardiography', 'ejection fraction', 'echocardiography', 'Cineangiocoronariography', 'Sleep variables', 'polysomnography', 'apnea/hypopnea index', 'apnea episodes', 'oxygen saturation', 'spirometric study', 'bronchodilator test', 'fasting blood glucose', 'calcium', 'phosphate', 'magnesium', 'creatinine', 'parathyroid hormone', 'laboratory', 'Biopsy', 'positive airway pressure (CPAP) tritation', 'pressure']","['20-year', 'nighttime', 'nighttime', 'daytime']"

It was followed by the spread of vesicular eruption to involve chest, back and bilateral upper and lower extremities over next 2-days. Review of systems was negative. The patient did not have a history of chickenpox during childhood or any recent exposure to it. There was no past history of diabetes, cardiac or pulmonary disease, or lymphoma. The patient has not been on immunosuppressive or other medications.
On examination, the patient was afebrile (37.4°C). He had vesicles and pustules, with crusting and swelling, in the distribution of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1) including its nasociliary branch. Both eyelids were swollen, tender and red. There was no corneal involvement. Vesicles, pustules and scabs in various stages were also present over trunk and extremities (Figure ). Palms and soles were spared and there was no lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary, cardiovascular and abdominal examinations were normal.
Complete blood count, peripheral smear, routine biochemistry, liver function tests, and chest x-ray were normal. CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts were 1.34 × 109/L and 0.61 × 109/L respectively (CD4:CD8 ratio = 2.2). Serology for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C were negative and RPR was non-reactive.

It was his first visit to the dentist. He did not present any significant medical history. Oral examination showed a fair oral hygiene, no carious lesion, and all the permanent teeth were present. The mandibular left central incisor was displaced lingually with an accessory cusp on the facial aspect which had an attrition facet on the incisal edge. The cusp projected from the cemento – enamel junction and curved towards the incisal edge of the incisor (Figure ). There was also attrition of the incisal half of the palatal aspect of the maxillary left central incisor. There was a negative family history of such dental anomaly from the patient and there was no associated systemic disorder. A periapical radiograph revealed an inverted V-shaped radiopaque structure on the mandibular left central incisor (Figure ). The extent of pulp tissue into the cusp could not be determined on the radiograph. A diagnosis of type 1 talon cusp was made. The condition and the planned periodic and gradual reduction of the cusp with topical fluoride application and Composite resin facing was explained to the patient. Orthodontic alignment of the displaced central incisor was also planned. With his consent, after oral prophylaxis, a minimal reduction of the talon cusp was carried out using a diamond bur in a high-speed water-cooled handpiece. Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride (APF) gel was applied to the surface of the reduced cusp and the maxillary left central incisor. The patient however failed to turn up for further treatment. It was assumed that as the patient was not initially concerned with the aesthetic effect of the cusp, the outcome was not important to him.","[[29.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['dental', 'Oral', 'oral', 'teeth', 'mandibular left central incisor', 'accessory cusp on the facial aspect', 'facial aspect', 'facet on the incisal edge', 'incisal edge of the incisor', 'incisal half of the palatal aspect of the maxillary left central incisor', 'dental', 'mandibular left central incisor', 'pulp tissue', 'cusp', 'cusp', 'central incisor', 'oral', 'talon cusp', 'surface of the reduced cusp', 'maxillary left central incisor', 'cusp']","['healthy looking', 'medical history', 'fair oral hygiene', 'carious lesion', 'all the permanent teeth were present', 'mandibular left central incisor was displaced lingually', 'accessory cusp', 'attrition facet on the incisal edge', 'attrition', 'attrition of the incisal half of the palatal aspect of the maxillary left central incisor', 'dental anomaly', 'systemic disorder', 'inverted V-shaped radiopaque structure', 'talon cusp', 'displaced central incisor', 'aesthetic effect of the cusp']","['fluoride', 'Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride (APF)']","['29', 'dental outpatient clinic', 'Lagos University Teaching Hospital']","['dental check-up', 'Oral examination', 'periapical radiograph', 'radiograph', 'periodic and gradual reduction of the cusp', 'fluoride application', 'Composite resin facing', 'Composite resin facing', 'Orthodontic alignment of the displaced central incisor', 'oral prophylaxis', 'minimal reduction of the talon cusp', 'minimal reduction of the talon cusp was carried out using a diamond bur in a high-speed water-cooled handpiece', 'treatment']",[]

It was associated with myalgia and recurrent vomiting followed by diffuse maculopapular rash all over the body with sparing of mucous membranes and periorbital tissues. On examination, he had conjunctival congestion with toxic facies. He had a past history of gout for which he received allolpurinol for twenty days and phenytoin for sudden loss of consciousness in another institution. There was no past history of tuberculosis, diabetes or hypertension.
Bilateral hard indurated cervical lymphadenopathy and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy was also observed along with bilateral parotid and submandibular gland enlargement. Hepatosplenomegaly was detected on ultrasonography. Hemogram on several occasions from admission revealed normal hemoglobin and red blood cell morphology. There was transient neutrophilic leukocytosis, whereas platelet counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal throughout. During his treatment with ceftriaxone, he suddenly developed shock, cyanosis and acute renal failure for which he was given inotropic support, amoxicillin, ceftazidine and steroids. He gradually responded and recovered in due course of time. A clinical diagnosis of shock syndrome due to Dengue fever or Epstein Barr virus (EBV) or streptococcus or phenytoin induced hypersensitivity syndrome was made. The Dengue virus IgM antibody Elisa was positive and serum D-dimer levels were positive (>200 ng/ml). Anti EBV IgG antibody test was positive but EBV IgM antibody test was negative. The serology tests for anti- cytomegalovirus antibody, anti leptospira antibody, Widal test, brucella (abortus and melitensis), and HIV were negative. The blood, throat swab and urine cultures were sterile. Paul-Bunnel and Weil-Felix tests were negative. Cervical lymph node biopsy was undertaken for histopathology.
Gross examination revealed four lymph nodes, the largest one measuring 1.5 cm and the rest below 1 cm. On microscopy, two of the lymph nodes (including the largest one) showed near total infarction of the parenchyma with preservation of cellular outlines of the lymphocytes (Fig ). A thin rim of viable subcapsular normal mature lymphocytes along with neutrophils and plasma cells were identified. The medullary vessels showed vascular congestion however the blood vessels in the perinodal adipose tissue showed multiple fibrin thrombi with congestion in some of the vessels (Fig ).
Multiple deeper sections revealed perinodal granulation tissue with viable subcapsular lymphoid tissue but no atypical cells, histiocytes or granulomas were seen. Stains for fungi and acid-fast bacilli were negative. The adjacent two uninvolved lymph nodes showed features of reactive change. Immunohistochemistry with B- cell (CD20) and T- cell (CD3) markers was performed. The viable lymphoid tissue showed an admixture of both B and T-cells. The infarcted tissue showed variable positivity and these markers highlighted few reactive follicles (Fig ). The uninvolved lymph nodes also showed a normal positivity pattern.
The patient was asymptomatic thereafter and had complete regression of the lymph nodes. He was lost to follow up after two months of discharge from the hospital.
Lymph node infarction is a rare phenomenon reported in literature in association with various neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions. The non-neoplastic conditions associated with infarction are namely polyarteritis nodosa, viral infections (Parvovirus B19, Infectious mononucleosis), cholesterol atheromatous embolism, thrombosis, gold injections, intestinal volvulus, postmediastinoscopy, mononeuritis multiplex, fine needle aspiration cytology and finally may be idiopathic [-]. Hemorrhagic infarction of hilar lymph nodes has also been reported recently in association with heart lung transplantation. [,]
The neoplastic lesions most commonly associated with infarction are malignant lymphoma and metastatic melanoma [,-]. The differential diagnosis pertaining to the present case would be the above mentioned two conditions along with necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi's lymphadenitis), mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation.
Serial deeper sections failed to reveal any evidence of either lymphoma or melanoma, any granulomatous inflammation, and vasculitis or monocytoid histiocytes, thus ruling out the above mentioned conditions. Drug induced hypersensitivity reactions in a lymph node especially due to phenytoin are known in the form of inter follicular expansion by a mixed infiltrate of immunoblasts, plasma cells and eosinophils with varying degrees of vascular proliferation. Focal necrosis has also been observed. Other drugs have been reported to show reactive change []. These changes were not seen in the present case in the non-infarcted lymph nodes. In the present case it appears that infarction of the lymph node occurred before the DIC became clinically evident.
A completely infarcted lymph node should alert the pathologist to the high possibility of malignant lymphoma, as it is the most common cause of spontaneous lymph node infarction []. Further investigation can be carried out by taking multiple deeper sections of the infarcted lymph node to visualize the viable subcapsular tissue for any clue of malignancy. Immunohistochemistry has been done on the infarcted lymph node sections to establish the underlying pathology. Although it is widely believed that necrotic tissue is not suitable for immunohistochemical study, this view may be inaccurate. [-]
The detection of spontaneous lymph node infarction should alert the pathologist and the clinician alike for an associated or underlying impending pathology. In a multicentre study of 51 cases of lymph-node infarction seen in the 30-year period, Maurer et al identified 14 cases of malignant lymphoma synchronously with the infarct. Of the remaining 37 patients, six showed manifestations of malignant lymphoma in the follow-up period within 2 years of the lymph-node infarction.
On analyzing other cases in the literature these authors also confirmed that a minority (26 of 81) have developed malignant lymphoma, which appeared within 2 years of infarction. Therefore, a thorough examination of both the infarcted lymph nodes and others resected at the same time is mandatory in order to exclude concomitant or underlying malignant lymphoma. The risk of development of malignant lymphoma after infarction was found to be negligible after two years [].","[[27.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['throat', 'all over the body', 'mucous membranes', 'periorbital tissues', 'conjunctival', 'facies', 'cervical', 'bilateral inguinal', 'bilateral parotid', 'submandibular gland', 'renal', 'throat', 'Cervical lymph node', 'two of the lymph nodes', 'parenchyma', 'medullary vessels', 'blood vessels in the perinodal adipose tissue', 'some of the vessels', 'vessels', 'Multiple deeper sections', 'perinodal', 'subcapsular lymphoid tissue', 'adjacent two uninvolved lymph nodes', 'lymph nodes', 'lymphoid tissue', 'tissue', 'follicles', 'lymph nodes', 'lymph nodes', 'Lymph node', 'intestinal', 'hilar lymph nodes', 'heart', 'lung', 'mucocutaneous lymph node', 'lymph node', 'lymph nodes', 'lymph node', 'lymph node', 'lymph node', 'deeper sections of the infarcted lymph node', 'subcapsular tissue', 'lymph node', 'necrotic tissue', 'lymph node', 'lymph-node', 'lymph-node', 'lymph nodes']","['fever', 'rigor', 'chills', 'sore throat', 'myalgia', 'vomiting', 'maculopapular rash', 'sparing', 'conjunctival congestion', 'toxic facies', 'gout', 'loss of consciousness', 'tuberculosis', 'diabetes', 'hypertension', 'cervical lymphadenopathy', 'bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy', 'enlargement', 'Hepatosplenomegaly', 'transient neutrophilic leukocytosis', 'shock', 'cyanosis', 'acute renal failure', 'gradually responded', 'shock syndrome', 'Dengue fever', 'Epstein Barr virus', 'EBV', 'streptococcus', 'phenytoin induced hypersensitivity syndrome', 'lymph nodes', 'total infarction of the parenchyma', 'preservation of cellular outlines of the lymphocytes', 'viable subcapsular normal mature lymphocytes', 'neutrophils', 'plasma cells', 'vascular congestion', 'fibrin thrombi', 'congestion', 'perinodal granulation tissue', 'viable subcapsular lymphoid tissue', 'atypical cells', 'histiocytes', 'granulomas', 'fungi', 'acid-fast bacilli', 'reactive change', 'admixture of both B and T-cells', 'infarcted tissue', 'reactive follicles', 'normal positivity pattern', 'asymptomatic', 'regression of the lymph nodes', 'Lymph node infarction', 'neoplastic', 'non-neoplastic conditions', 'non-neoplastic conditions', 'polyarteritis nodosa', 'viral infections', 'Parvovirus B19', 'Infectious mononucleosis', 'cholesterol atheromatous embolism', 'thrombosis', 'gold injections', 'intestinal volvulus', 'mononeuritis multiplex', 'idiopathic', 'Hemorrhagic infarction of hilar lymph nodes', 'neoplastic lesions', 'infarction', 'malignant lymphoma', 'metastatic melanoma', 'necrotizing lymphadenitis', ""Kikuchi's lymphadenitis"", 'mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome', 'necrotizing granulomatous inflammation', 'lymphoma', 'melanoma', 'granulomatous inflammation', 'vasculitis', 'monocytoid histiocytes', 'Drug induced hypersensitivity reactions', 'inter follicular expansion', 'mixed infiltrate of immunoblasts, plasma cells and eosinophils', 'vascular proliferation', 'Focal necrosis', 'reactive change', 'non-infarcted lymph nodes', 'infarction of the lymph node', 'DIC', 'infarcted lymph node', 'malignant lymphoma', 'lymph node infarction', 'malignancy', 'infarcted lymph node sections', 'lymph node infarction', 'impending pathology', 'lymph-node infarction', 'malignant lymphoma', 'infarct', 'malignant lymphoma', 'lymph-node infarction', 'lymphoma', 'infarction', 'infarcted lymph nodes', 'malignant lymphoma', 'malignant lymphoma', 'infarction']","['allolpurinol', 'phenytoin', 'ceftriaxone', 'amoxicillin', 'ceftazidine', 'phenytoin']","['Paul-Bunnel', 'Weil-Felix', '26']","['ultrasonography', 'Hemogram', 'hemoglobin', 'red blood cell morphology', 'platelet counts', 'erythrocyte sedimentation rate', 'treatment', 'inotropic support', 'steroids', 'Dengue virus IgM antibody Elisa', 'serum D-dimer levels', 'Anti EBV IgG antibody test', 'EBV IgM antibody test', 'serology tests', 'anti- cytomegalovirus antibody', 'anti leptospira antibody', 'leptospira antibody', 'Widal test', 'brucella', 'abortus', 'melitensis', 'HIV', 'blood', 'throat swab', 'urine cultures', 'Paul-Bunnel', 'Weil-Felix tests', 'Cervical lymph node biopsy', 'histopathology', 'Gross examination', 'microscopy', 'Stains for fungi and acid-fast bacilli', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'B- cell (CD20) and T- cell (CD3) markers', 'gold injections', 'postmediastinoscopy', 'fine needle aspiration cytology', 'heart lung transplantation', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'immunohistochemical study', 'examination', 'resected']","['ten days', 'ten days', 'ten days', 'ten days', '30-year period', '2 years']"

The patient underwent pneumonectomy and unilateral lymphadenectomy in December 2001. Because of histologically verified positive resection margins, it was decided to administer 4 cycles of a postoperative polychemotherapy regimen including cisplatin 25 mg/m2and etoposide 120 mg/m2 on day 1, day 2 and day 3 followed by chest irradiation. Due to a prescription error, the patient received 75 mg/m2 cisplatin per day, instead of 25 mg/m2 resulting in a total dose of 225 mg/m2 cisplatin within a 3-day period. The error was not noticed and the patient was discharged. Two days later, the patient presented with severe nausea and vomiting, loss of hearing, tinnitus and was unable to eat and drink. Due to the severity of these side effects, the medical records of the patient were reviewed and the cisplatin overdose was discovered. Supportive treatment including vigorous hydration, electrolyte replacement and antiemetic therapy was started immediately. Total platinum plasma levels which were determined daily showed highly elevated values (2.9 mg platinum per kg plasma). Therefore, plasmapheresis was performed on day 5 and 6 after the last administration of cisplatin to attempt to eliminate the drug. The platinum concentrations were measured by an Agilent 7500c inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a PFA50 microconcentric nebulizer. The plasma samples were mineralisated microwave assisted with a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid (1 ml sample + 2 ml of nitric acid + 0.5 ml of hydrochloric acid + 1.5 ml ultrapure water) in an UltraCLAVE2 (EMLS, Leutkirch, Germany) at 250°C for 30 minutes before measurement. Plasmapheresis was carried out via a catheter placed in the right femoral vein and using a plasma filtration technique with Hemaplex BT 900/A Filters (Dideco, Mirandola, Italy). During each treatment session, 3 liters of plasma were removed and continuously substituted with 1.5 liter of solvent-detergent treated standardized pooled human plasma (Octaplas, Octapharma Vienna, Austria) and 1.5 liter of 5% human albumin (Immuno, Vienna, Austria). Anticoagulation therapy during plasmapheresis consisted of 3000 IU (international units) heparin administered as intravenous bolus and 1000 IU heparin per hour as continuous infusion. The plasma levels of total platinum showed a marked decline after plasma exchange at first, followed by a small rise and then a constant decline afterwards as demonstrated in Figure . After the first plasmapheresis, hearing loss and tinnitus improved gradually as well as renal failure. (The elevated laboratory findings are shown in Table.) Severe myelosuppression required the administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, two units of packed and irradiated erythrocytes as well as two units of packed, pooled and irradiated thrombocytes. In order to manage prolonged severe nausea and vomiting which lasted for 12 days, a complex antiemetic regimen including 5HT3-antagonists, dexamethasone, metoclopramide and neuroleptics was given. Finally, we were able to discharge the patient 18 days after onset of the overdose. She recovered completely from all toxicities including hearing loss which was proven clinically and by audiometry (Figure ) except for a subclinical renal impairment remaining from the acute renal failure (Table). Further antineoplastic therapy was continued with 2 cycles of a carboplatin-based regimen followed by chest irradiation. The patient showed no signs of relapse until March 2003, when a single brain metastasis was discovered and removed by surgery. In September 2003, recurrence of multiple brain metastases was detected and the patient died in January 2004 due to repeated progression of these metastases despite several treatment attempts. During the whole course of disease, no other metastatic sites and no late onset toxicities were observed in the patient.","[[46.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['right lung', 'chest', 'right femoral vein', 'renal', 'renal', 'renal', 'chest', 'brain', 'brain']","['adenocarcinoma of the right lung', 'positive resection margins', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'loss of hearing', 'tinnitus', 'unable to eat', 'unable to eat and drink', 'side effects', 'cisplatin overdose', 'hearing loss', 'tinnitus', 'renal failure', 'elevated laboratory findings', 'myelosuppression', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'overdose', 'recovered completely from all toxicities', 'hearing loss', 'renal impairment', 'acute renal failure', 'relapse', 'brain metastasis', 'brain metastases', 'died', 'metastases', 'disease', 'metastatic sites', 'toxicities']","['cisplatin', 'etoposide', 'cisplatin', 'cisplatin', 'cisplatin', 'cisplatin', 'nitric acid', 'hydrochloric acid', 'nitric acid', 'hydrochloric acid', 'ultrapure water', 'Dideco', 'human plasma', 'Octaplas', 'human albumin', 'heparin', 'heparin', 'dexamethasone', 'metoclopramide', 'carboplatin-based']","['46', 'December 2001', 'Germany', 'Germany', 'Vienna', 'Austria', 'Vienna', 'March 2003', 'September 2003', 'January 2004']","['pneumonectomy', 'unilateral lymphadenectomy', 'resection margins', 'polychemotherapy regimen', 'chest irradiation', 'Supportive treatment', 'vigorous hydration', 'electrolyte replacement', 'antiemetic therapy', 'Total platinum plasma levels', 'plasmapheresis', 'platinum concentrations', 'plasma samples', 'Plasmapheresis', 'catheter placed in the right femoral vein and using a plasma filtration technique with Hemaplex BT 900/A Filters', '3 liters of plasma were removed', 'Anticoagulation therapy', 'plasmapheresis', 'plasma levels of total platinum', 'plasma exchange', 'plasmapheresis', 'laboratory', 'granulocyte-colony stimulating factor', 'packed and irradiated erythrocytes', 'packed, pooled and irradiated thrombocytes', 'antiemetic regimen', '5HT3-antagonists', 'neuroleptics', 'audiometry', 'antineoplastic therapy', 'chest irradiation', 'brain metastasis was discovered and removed by surgery', 'removed by surgery', 'treatment']","['December 2001', 'December 2001', 'postoperative', 'Two days later', 'Two days later', 'Two days later', 'Two days later', 'Two days later', 'on day 5 and 6', '12 days', '12 days', '18 days', 'January 2004']"

Vitals signs were initially stable, physical exam was significant for distended, tender abdomen. A CT scan revealed extraluminal intraperitoneal air and the patient was taken to the operating room. Exploratory laparotomy revealed an incarcerated peristomal hernia with perforated small bowel. Extensive enterolysis, small bowel resection and hernia repair with permacol were performed. Cultures grew Escherichia coli; pathology revealed only neutrophilic inflammation. Due to the severity of disease, and distention of small bowel, the abdomen was left open to heal by secondary intention. Her postoperative course was complicated by severe sepsis syndrome with respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, and DIC. Broad spectrum antibiotics were administered. The patient was also treated with hydrocortisone 100 mg every 8 hours and subsequently developed steroid induced hyperglycemia. On postoperative day (POD) 3, a vacuum assisted closure (VAC) device was placed to assist with fascial healing. The sepsis syndrome resolved and the patient's condition improved until POD 9, when stool was noticed collecting within the VAC system. The patient was returned to the operating room where she was found to have an anastamotic breakdown.
Pathology from the second surgery showed transmural ischemic necrosis with angioinvasion of a fungal organism (see figure ). Fungal blood cultures were obtained and the patient was started on amphotericin B lipid complex. Within 48 hours, fungal blood cultures were positive for Penicillium sp. The patient completed a 6 week course of amphotericin B lipid complex, followed by an extended course oral intraconazole. The patient was eventually transferred to a long-term rehabilitation facility, without evidence of recurrent infection. The only identified risk factors for invasive Penicillium infection were stress dose steroids and broad spectrum antibiotics. Final fungal identification demonstrated the organism to be Penicillium chrysogenumA. In vitro susceptibility at 24 and 48 hrs respectively was reported as: amphotericin B 0.5 μg/ml and 1.0 μg/ml, itraconazole 0.06 μg/ml and 0.25 μg/ml, and voriconazole 0.25 μg/ml and 1 μg/mlB.","[[51.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['abdominal', 'abdomen', 'extraluminal intraperitoneal', 'peristomal', 'small bowel', 'small bowel', 'small bowel', 'abdomen', 'respiratory', 'fascial', 'VAC system', 'transmural']","['diverticulitis', 'abdominal pain', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'distended', 'tender abdomen', 'extraluminal intraperitoneal air', 'incarcerated peristomal hernia', 'perforated small bowel', 'enterolysis', 'hernia', 'Escherichia coli', 'neutrophilic inflammation', 'disease', 'distention of small bowel', 'sepsis syndrome', 'respiratory failure', 'hypotension', 'leukocytosis', 'DIC', 'steroid induced hyperglycemia', 'fascial healing', 'sepsis syndrome', 'condition improved', 'stool was noticed collecting within the VAC system', 'anastamotic breakdown', 'transmural ischemic necrosis', 'angioinvasion of a fungal organism', 'Penicillium sp.', 'infection', 'invasive Penicillium infection', 'Penicillium chrysogenumA']","['hydrocortisone', 'amphotericin B lipid complex', 'amphotericin B lipid complex', 'intraconazole', 'amphotericin B', 'itraconazole', 'voriconazole']","['51', 'emergency department', 'operating room', 'operating room', 'Pathology']","['colostomy', 'Vitals signs', 'physical exam', 'CT scan', 'Exploratory laparotomy', 'Extensive enterolysis', 'small bowel resection', 'hernia repair with permacol', 'Cultures', 'pathology', 'abdomen was left open to heal', 'Broad spectrum antibiotics', 'vacuum assisted closure (VAC) device was placed', 'Pathology', 'Fungal blood cultures', 'fungal blood cultures', 'steroids', 'broad spectrum antibiotics', 'fungal identification', 'vitro susceptibility']","['status post', '48 hour', '48 hour', '48 hour', 'POD 9', '24 and 48 hrs']"

In addition to fever and chills, she reported intermittent episodes of sustained abdominal pain in the past two months, which worsened by meals and radiating to the right-scapular area. Six years previously, she had undergone cholecystectomy without choledochoenteric anastomosis for symptomatic cholelithiasis.
The patient was a known case of rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus, her medications consisting of insulin, prednisolone, chloroquine and methotroxate.
On admission, the patient had a temperature of 38.5 C and was noted to have icteric sclera. A right upper quadrant scar was seen on her abdomen. The patient's abdomen was soft and non-distended with normal bowel sounds, albeit tender to deep palpation in the epigastrium and the right upper quadrant. There was no evidence of rebound tenderness or peritoneal signs.
Laboratory data on admission were notable for an elevated total bilirubin of 7.1 mg/dl (nl 0.2–1.1); direct bilirubin of 4.7 mg/dl (nl up to 0.5); alkaline phosphatase of 1217 IU/L (nl 64–306); SGOT of 78 U/L (nl 5–40); and SGPT of 185 U/L (nl 5–40). The total white blood cell count was 10,800 /cmm; prothrombin time was 13 second (nl 10–13) and the c-reactive protein was 2+.
Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated the dilation of the biliary tree with visible choledocholithiasis. Abdominal CT-scan revealed a dilated biliary tract with air entrapment in the lateral side of the right lobe of the liver. The patient subsequently underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The ERCP illustrated multiple stones, the prominent one of which was a 2.5-cm mass. Despite attempts for lithotripsy and sphincterotomy, however, ERCP failed to retrieve all the materials. Therefore, the remaining stone- like objects and materials were successfully removed by means of common bile duct (CBD) exploration (Figure ). Intra-operative findings included multiple stones and a 2.5-cm nonhomogenous mass, impacted in a dilated CBD and having a distorted anatomy due to adhesions, without any signs of previous anastomoses. A drainage T-tube was inserted through CBD. Nine days after the surgery, a post-operative T-tube cholangiography accidentally detected a long choledochoduodenal fistula (Figure ). Since the whole management process from ERCP to T-tube cholangiography did not take more than 3 weeks, both the endoscopist and the surgeon must have failed to detect the fistula because of its overlap with the duodenum and the distorted anatomy.
A histological assessment of the objects removed revealed fibrinoid materials with some cellular debris.

The operating theatres were not available for a further 4–5 hours and the patient had just eaten. Due to the presence of a fracture the procedure of surgical incision to evacuate the haematoma within the accident and emergency department setting could bear an unacceptable high risk of infection. Whilst on the other hand waiting for the operating theatres to become available and allowing enough time from the patients last meal for general anaesthesia may result in a large area of skin necrosis overlying a fracture. By using this technique the haematoma was evacuated within 5–10 minutes by the single insertion of a 16 gauge needle. No analgesia was used as the needle was inserted into the edge of skin that was already stretched. Minimal discomfort was felt during evacuation but dramatic pain relief followed from release of the tension. The patient was subsequently admitted for open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture which was performed after 24 hours in optimal conditions.","[[43.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['elbow', 'subcutaneous', 'olecranon', 'skin', 'skin', 'olecranon', 'bony', 'skin', 'skin', 'edge of skin']","['elbow injury', 'subcutaneous haematoma', 'skin vascularity was compromised', 'urgent release of the skin tension', 'skin tension', 'displaced olecranon', 'displaced olecranon fracture', 'bony fragments stretching the skin', 'fracture', 'haematoma', 'infection', 'skin necrosis', 'fracture', 'haematoma', 'discomfort', 'fracture', 'optimal conditions']",[],"['43', 'emergency department', 'emergency department']","['radiograph', 'surgical incision to evacuate the haematoma', 'general anaesthesia', 'analgesia', 'needle was inserted into the edge of skin that was already stretched', 'evacuation', 'dramatic pain relief', 'open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture']",[]

Initially he was able to walk but later his mobility became limited due to knee pain not responding to oral analgesia. His knee examination revealed a large haematoma in the prepatella bursa with the overlying skin vascularity compromised and the skin covered with blisters as shown in figure . A radiograph of the knee showed no fractures. The patient was on warfarin due to a previous pulmonary embolism and the lNR level was 3. An urgent evacuation of the haematoma was required to release the tension. However, patient was not starved or prepared for general anaesthesia and the haematoma size was too large for the use of local anaesthesia. Formal incision and drainage with an INR of 3 could trigger a haemorrhage requiring extension of the incision to control the blood loss and accordingly full preparation by blood cross matching and general anaesthesia is then needed. Waiting until the INR is within the operative range will require 24–48 hours and the patient is likely to end up with a large area of skin necrosis. An attempt of simple aspiration of the haematoma by the accident and emergency staff failed. Thus, the technique was used and the tension released within 10 minutes in the accident and emergency department. A compression bandage was applied and the knee was rested for few days in a splint. The case was followed up and there was no evidence of re-collection of the haematoma under tension, skin necrosis or infection. Accordingly formal incision and drainage was not required at a later stage.","[[75.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['knees', 'knee', 'knee', 'prepatella bursa', 'skin', 'skin', 'knee', 'pulmonary', 'skin', 'knee', 'skin']","['falling', 'able to walk', 'mobility became limited', 'knee pain', 'haematoma', 'skin vascularity compromised', 'skin covered with blisters', 'fractures', 'pulmonary embolism', 'haematoma', 'tension', 'starved', 'prepared for general anaesthesia', 'haematoma', 'haemorrhage', 'skin necrosis', 'haematoma', 're-collection of the haematoma under tension', 'skin necrosis', 'infection']",['warfarin'],"['75', 'emergency department', 'emergency department']","['analgesia', 'knee examination', 'radiograph of the knee', 'lNR level', 'evacuation of the haematoma', 'local anaesthesia', 'Formal incision and drainage', 'INR', 'extension of the incision to control the blood loss', 'general anaesthesia', 'INR', 'simple aspiration of the haematoma', 'compression bandage was applied', 'knee was rested', 'formal incision and drainage', 'incision and drainage']",['eight hours']

Ultrasonography revealed multiple abscesses in spleen. He was managed on antibiotics for 21 days but fever continued. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of abdomen showed multiple abscesses in spleen without any other significant findings in abdominal organs. Around 200 ml of pus was aspirated under guidance, which was negative for bacteriological examination. He was kept on parenteral antibiotics but did not have any relief.
Color Doppler of heart excluded any possibility of infective endocarditis. X-ray chest was normal. Montoux test was positive up to 11 × 11 mm and he was put on antitubercular treatment to which he did not respond in 6 weeks.

301,1363725-1,16409627,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1363725.xml,Scoliosis treatment using spinal manipulation and the Pettibon Weighting System™: a summary of 3 atypical presentations,"A 37-yr-old female presented to a private spine clinic with a chief complaint of episodic neck and back pain. The subject began care while her daughter was being treated for scoliosis in the same clinic. She presented with a past medical history including previous diagnosis and treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Her previous treatment included spinal fusion and Harrington rod instrumentation. Preoperatively, a 58° right thoracic scoliosis was found between T6 and T11. Harrington rod instrumentation reduced the scoliosis to 26°. We were unable to review her medical records pre and post arthrodesis. Although her family history identified a possible genetic component with her daughter's medical history, her preceding family history was negative for scoliosis.
The subject initially filled out a Functional Rating Index. This index, described and tested by Feise et al [], is a combination of the Neck Disability Index and the Oswestry Back Pain Index. This form provides a valid and reliable self-rated assessment of functional improvement in daily activities.
On static visual posture examination, a moderate anterior right shoulder, a protruding right scapula, and a right rib hump were identified. These visual postural findings are used as screening indicators so that unnecessary radiographic studies are not undertaken. Adam's test confirmed the right rib hump on forward bending. This test is classically used in the primary care setting to screen for scoliosis, although its reliability has been called into question [].
The radiographs series consisted of lateral cervical and lumbar views, as well as opposing frontal views. The lateral films were taken to calculate the amount of cervical lordosis, forward head posture, and lumbar lordosis. The cervical lordosis was measured from an angle between 2 lines intersecting the posterior C2 and C7 vertebral bodies. The lumbar lordosis was taken from the angle formed by the intersection of 2 posterior tangent lines drawn from the back of L1 and L5. Preliminary evidence suggests that correcting the sagittal spine before reducing the scoliotic curvature may promote a longer lasting correction [,]. In this case, the initial cervical lordosis measured 23° from C2 to C7, the initial forward head posture measured 31 mm, and the lumbar lordosis measured 31°. Analysis of forward head posture was performed by drawing a vertical line from the posterior inferior corner of C7 upward []. The distance from this line to the posterior superior corner of C2 is measured in millimeters. The initial standing AP radiograph showed a right thoracic scoliosis of 35°, shown in Figure . This measurement was taken from a Cobb angle drawn between the superior endplate of T6 and the inferior endplate of T11. We used a sectional view of the thoracolumbar spine to reduce positional distortion commonly encountered on full-spine films []. The film was taken at a 72"" film to focal distance (FFD) to reduce magnification distortion. For radiographic analytical purposes, we used the positioning and analysis methods outlined by Harrison et al [,-]. These methods have shown good to excellent reliability in terms of patient positioning, and inter- and intra-examiner reliability. Initially, the patient self-rated her back and neck pain as a 7/10 on a numerical pain rating scale.
The Pettibon corrective procedures [] were used in this patient's care plan. The goal of these procedures is to promote a normal [-] sagittal spinal contour. A specific treatment plan was created based upon a trial treatment involving the Pettibon procedures. The patient received bilateral cervical spine traction-type manipulation to mobilize several cervical spinal joints, and then was immediately fitted with a 4-lb Pettibon Headweight. ® The patient walked on a treadmill for 10 minutes while wearing the headweight. After 10 minutes, a follow-up lateral cervical radiograph was taken while wearing the headweight. The purpose of this lateral stress view is to evaluate the potential improvement in cervical lordosis and reduction in forward head posture. Cervical lordosis and forward head posture are again measured on these stress views to evaluate response to treatment. Although earlier studies suggest that a 23° cervical lordosis may also be normal [-], newer research identifies a cervical lordosis closer to the 40° range [,,] Despite this evidence; the concept of a normal cervical lordosis remains a debatable issue. Once it was determined that the patient could benefit by the proposed treatment, a plan was developed and implemented specifically for her. Her plan included once-weekly office visits, with an emphasis on home care exercises to promote patient independence. Each visit consisted of warm-up procedures, manipulation, and rehabilitative exercises.
The warm-up procedures consisted of Pettibon Wobble Chair® Exercises, shown in Figure . The Pettibon Wobble Chair® is a chair designed to isolate the lumbar spine so that core training may take place. The goals of the chair are to promote lumbar stability, muscular coordination, and increase flexibility. However, the benefits of the chair itself remain to be investigated. The Wobble Chair® exercises are performed by holding the head and shoulders still, moving only the pelvic girdle. The exercises consist of a front-to-back motion, a side-to-side motion, and clockwise/counterclockwise circles. Each exercise was performed 20 times, for a total of 80 repetitions at each office visit.
Side-posture lumbopelvic adjustments were delivered bilaterally to mobilize the sacroiliac joints. Cervical spine manipulation was performed by hand in accordance with the radiographic findings. The cervical spine manipulative procedures can be found in the osteopathic literature [].
The rehabilitative included the use of a 4-lb anterior Pettibon Headweight®, a right low shoulderweight, and a left high shoulderweight. An illustration of the weighting system is shown in Figure . During each office visit, the subject wore the headweight and shoulderweights while standing or walking. This exercise was performed for 10 minutes following the manipulative procedures. The patient was instructed to wear the headweight and shoulderweights at home for 20 minutes twice daily. Positional traction, on 2 triangular foam blocks placed at the cervicothoracic and thoracolumbar junctions, was performed once daily immediately before bed for 20 minutes.
After 8 visits in 8 weeks, post radiographs were taken to quantify changes in the sagittal and frontal spinal curves. Additionally, the subject filled out a follow-up Functional Rating Index to compare to the original. The Functional Rating Index score dropped from a 33% disability rating to 8%, and the numerical pain rating scale, rated a 7.0/10 at the onset of care, dropped to a 0/10. The average numerical pain rating scale score over the 8-week span was 3.3 out of 10.
On the post-treatment anteroposterior radiograph, the Cobb angle from T6–T11 was reduced from 35° to 22°. Her cervical lordosis measured 40°, while her forward head posture reduced to 13 mm. The follow-up radiographs were taken at the beginning of the 9th visit prior to treatment, one week after the previous treatment.
A 30-yr-old African-American male presented to a private spine clinic with a chief complaint of chronic mid thoracic pain. The patient had a previous medical diagnosis of Scheuermann's Disease. Moderate wedging was found on previous lateral lumbar and thoracic radiographs at the levels of T7–T10. The patient reported having the back pain consistently over the last 8–10 years, with recurrent episodes of intense myospasms occurring in the paraspinal musculature at the thoracolumbar junction. The patient had been previously managed unsuccessfully with prescription NSAIDS, muscle relaxants, and physical therapy consisting of cryotherapy, electric stimulation, and postural isotonic exercises. The patient could not recall any childhood traumatic events that may have contributed to the vertebral wedging asymmetry.
The subject initially filled out a Functional Rating Index []. We used this form to provide an objective assessment of functional improvement in daily activities. On static visual posture examination, a moderate high and anterior left shoulder and a right rib hump were identified. The paraspinal thoracolumbar musculature had also been significantly developed. Although these factors are not differential for Scheuermann's Disease, they do represent postural abnormalities often associated with scoliosis. Palpatory findings included marked areas of spasticity over the right latissimus dorsi, the left trapezius, the left quadratus lumborum, and the left rhomboid muscles.
Standing anteroposterior and lateral cervical and lumbar radiographs were obtained and analyzed for regional alignment as previously described. Gross radiographic visualization showed a postural swayback positioning, where the pelvis shifts anterior in relation to the thoracic cage. This may result from activation of the pelvo-ocular reflex to compensate for a forward head position []. The initial absolute rotation angles (ARA) from C2–C7 on the lateral cervical view [] and L1–L5 on the lateral lumbar view [] were drawn and measured. Prior to treatment, these angles measured 32° and 55°, respectively. According to Harrison et al, the normal lumbar lordosis should measure 39.7°, with a majority of the lordosis comprised in the L4-S1 region []. Prior to treatment, the forward head posture measured 22 mm, compared to an average normal of <20 mm []. The vertical axis line (VAL), measured from the anterior portion of the sacral base, should intersect the T11/T12 area []. In this case, the patient's VAL was 56 mm anterior to this interspace, consistent with a swayback type of posture. In the coronal views, a left thoracic scoliosis was found between the levels of T1–T5 measuring 22°. Nothing remarkable was found on the AP lumbopelvic.
The patient began an initial treatment plan consisting of 3 weekly visits for 4 weeks. The goals of this initial treatment plan were very specific, including restoring normal sagittal cervical and lumbar curves, reducing forward head posture, and reducing the swayback posture.
The initial 4 weeks of care consisted of manipulative and rehabilitative therapy designed to improve the static alignment of the sagittal spine. These methods are part of the Pettibon system []. The first 12 visits entailed the same procedures in the same order. To begin each visit, the patient performed a series of exercises on a Pettibon Wobble Chair®. This chair is consists of a multiplanar seat that allows the user to perform specific spinopelvic motion patterns. Clinical observation by the authors suggests that these exercises seem to make the manipulative treatment easier on the patient.
In this case, manipulative treatment included bilateral cervical manipulation and anterior thoracic manipulation to mobilize any restricted cervical and/or thoracic segments.
Following the manipulative treatment, the patient was fitted with a Pettibon Headweight® containing 4 lbs on the front of the forehead. The patient walked for 15 minutes while wearing the headweight. After 15 minutes, the patient laid supine on a pair of high-density foam blocks to promote a normal sagittal spinal contour. This was done while lying on an intersegmental traction table for 7 minutes. The patient was prescribed specific home care exercises to be performed daily between visits, and was instructed to walk with the Pettibon Headweight® for 20 minutes twice daily on non-clinic days, and lie on the high-density foam blocks for 20 minutes every night immediately before bed. After 4 weeks, post treatment lateral cervical and lateral lumbar radiographs were taken to quantify improvement in sagittal alignment.
The post lateral cervical showed a 32° cervical lordosis and 5 mm of forward head posture. The post lateral lumbar showed a 44° lumbar lordosis, while the vertical axis line fell 30 mm from the T11/T12 interspace. The 4-week functional rating index improved from a 70% disability to 50% disability, while the numerical pain rating scale dropped from a 9/10 to an 8/10.
Given the presence of bony deformity, we felt that significant time must be spent reducing the asymmetrical loading in the thoracic spine for coronal correction to be achieved. Therefore, the frequency of visits remained at 3 times per week over the next 20 weeks. Over this 20-week period of care, the manipulative treatment remained the same. However, several new rehab procedures were added. The patient still wore the headweight for 15 minutes immediately following the manipulative treatment. After the headweight, the patient worked out on the Pettibon Wobble Chair® while simultaneously performing cephalad traction, demonstrated in Figure . Following this procedure, a specific isometric exercise was performed on a Pettibon Linked Trainer. ® This exercise, shown in Figure , is designed to isolate the right rhomboid muscle. Theoretically, the linked trainer stabilizes the scapula, thereby functionally changing the origin and insertion of the rhomboid. This form of exercise has been previously illustrated with practitioner assistance []. Typically, the function of the rhomboid is to retract the scapula. However, when the scapula is stabilized, now the muscle may effectively pull on its proximal attachment, that being the spinous processes from T5–T8. Therefore, by switching the action of the muscle, our goal was to use the rhomboid to help reduce the left thoracic scoliosis. The patient was instructed to perform this exercise by pulling and holding for 10 seconds, repeating this process until the muscle is sufficiently fatigued. Finally, lateral traction was performed on the thoracic scoliosis using a high-density foam block while in a side-lying position. This block was placed beneath the apex of the scoliotic curvature for 15 minutes. Home care exercises remained the same. However, the frequency of the exercises was dropped to 3 times per week instead of daily. At the conclusion of the 20 weeks, post treatment AP cervicothoracic and lumbopelvic radiographs were taken to quantify improvement. The Cobb angle of the left thoracic scoliosis from T1–T5 reduced to 14°. A comparative view of the pre and post AP cervicothoracic views is shown in Figure . A 20-week functional rating index score dropped to a 28% disability rating, while the numerical pain rating scale dropped to a 6/10.
A 23-year-old female presented with bilateral diffuse neck and lumbodorsal pain, and right-sided scapular and shoulder pain. The pain was constant and sharp in nature with radicular pain into the right arm and elbow. At age 12, her primary care physician diagnosed her with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. At that time, the treatment plan was mainly comprised of observational methods, such as radiographs, visualization, and MRI. About one year before presenting to the primary author's clinic, she was referred for physical therapy by an orthopedic surgeon, which produced little subjective benefit, according to the patient.
On visual examination, a prominent left posterior rib hump was identified. In the frontal plane, she also displayed a marked high left shoulder with anterior rotation. Left anterior pelvic rotation was also well visualized. Given these preliminary findings, along with the positive past history of scoliosis, radiographic imaging was ordered to locate and calculate the nature and severity of the scoliosis. Initial standing 14"" × 17"" sectional radiographs showed a 37° left thoracic scoliosis, measured from the superior endplate of the T3 vertebra and the inferior endplate of the T7 vertebra. She also had a 26° right lumbar scoliosis measured from the superior endplate of T10 and the inferior endplate of L3. In the sagittal plane, her initial cervical lordosis measured 18°, while her lumbar lordosis measured 50°.
The patient began a treatment plan of 3 visits per week for 4 weeks, followed by once weekly visits for 12 weeks. Goals for the first 4 weeks of treatment included: 1) improvement of sagittal spine alignment, 2) reduction in pain and symptoms, and 3) functional improvement. A specific treatment routine was followed at each visit for the first 12 visits.
Each visit began with spinal warm-up exercises performed on a Pettibon Wobble Chair™. The patient then received a brief (less than 15 minutes) session of deep tissue massage therapy applied to the postural muscles. Following these procedures, manipulative intervention took place. The manipulative techniques are collectively taught within the Pettibon technique [], and were employed according to this methodology. First, a posteroanterior high-velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) procedure was applied to mobilize the thoracolumbar region. This was followed by anterior thoracic manipulation to mobilize the cervicothoracic region. A side-lying sacral manipulation was performed bilaterally to mobilize the sacroiliac joints and the lumbosacral joint. Cervical manipulation was performed only on those visits where a supine leg check revealed evidence of leg length inequality (LLI). In the cervical region, an HVLA thrust was applied cranially, thus creating a traction-type adjustive force compared to more traditional shear- or rotary-type cervical manipulative procedures. All of the manipulative techniques are well illustrated and explained by Gibbons and Tehan []. The patient received cervical manipulation in 8 of the first 12 visits.
Immediately following the manipulative intervention, the patient performed her spinal rehabilitative care. In her case, a 4-lb Pettibon Headweight was worn on the front of the head for 10 minutes while maintaining a standing position. Finally, the patient ended each of these visits with the supine positional traction for 7 minutes. The patient was instructed to perform the headweight twice daily between visits for 20-minute intervals. She was also given a set of foam blocks to lie on at night for 20 minutes immediately before bedtime.
After this initial 4-week treatment period, a follow-up radiographic series was obtained, along with a follow-up Functional Rating Index. Comparative radiographic analysis showed a reduced Cobb angle of 29° from T3–T7 and 18° from T10-L3. The sagittal cervical lordosis improved to 32°, while the lumbar lordosis decreased to 45°. The follow-up Functional Rating Index score dropped from 48% to 28% disability.
Following this treatment period, clinical visits dropped to once weekly over the next 12 weeks. During this time, the Pettibon Linked Trainer™ was incorporated into her treatment plan. The Linked Trainer™ exercises were performed after the anterior headweighting procedure at each visit. Dynamic cervical traction was also applied while performing the Pettibon Wobble Chair™ exercises, immediately prior to the spinal manipulative therapy. Finally, a side-lying traction procedure was added to her treatment to help lengthen the soft tissue structures on the concave side of the spinal curvatures. A triangular foam block was placed under the patient's left side, below the apex of the thoracic curvature, while a 25-lb weight was placed above the apex of the lumbar curvature. The patient assumed a left side-lying position during this traction session. This traction maneuver followed the anterior headweighting and the Linked Trainer™ exercises. This procedure was performed for 40 minutes at each office visit as well as at home once daily. The frequency of headweight use at home dropped to 3 days weekly instead of daily.
After 12 weeks of the foregoing treatment, the patient was again re-evaluated using static spinal radiography and the Functional Rating Index. Radiographic analysis demonstrated a 21° left thoracic scoliosis from T3–T7, and a 15° right lumbar scoliosis from T10-L3. Her Functional Rating Index score further reduced to an 18% disability. The patient was asked to continue once daily home treatment consisting of the side-lying traction procedure for 40 minutes, and supine positional traction 20 minutes immediately before bedtime. She was also instructed to continue wearing the anterior headweight at home 3 days a week for 15 minutes per day. After 10 months under this home care regimen, the patient presented for a second follow-up evaluation. At this time, her Functional Rating Index reduced to an 8% disability, while her sagittal cervical and lumbar curves marginally improved to 34° and 42°, respectively. Her left thoracic scoliosis was further reduced to 18°, and her right lumbar scoliosis was maintained at 15°. Therefore, after a total of 4 months of active treatment and 10 months of weekly home care rehabilitation, her spinal curvatures were reduced a total of 19° in the thoracic curvature and 21° in the lumbar curvature. Her pre- and post- radiographs are shown in Figure .","[[37.0, 'year']]",F,2006,[],[],[],[],[],[]
302,1363728-1,16405720,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1363728.xml,Successful rescue therapy with tenofovir in a patient with hepatic decompensation and adefovir resistant HBV mutant,"In 1997, a 55 year-old Vietnamese man was diagnosed with HBV cirrhosis without hepatitis delta virus (HDV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfections. Probably, the route of infection was vertical transmission. Cirrhosis was confirmed by liver biopsy and was complicated only by grade 1 oesophageal varices (Child Pugh score A5). HBe antigen was negative, HBe antibody positive, HBV viral load (HBV-DNA) was 7.15 log10 copies/ml (Digene hybrid capture assay) and the HBV genotype was B. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were twice the upper limit of normal (ULN).
In August 1998, lamivudine, 100 mg/day, was started. Three months later, HBV-DNA was undetectable by Digene assay and, in February 1999, by qualitative PCR (sensitivity limit at 4 log10). Lamivudine was inadvertently stopped after only 10 months of treatment, and then started again in January 2000 when a relapse occurred with a rising HBV-DNA to 5.75 log10 and ALT values at 3.1 ULN. The next 2 years of treatment were uneventful with undetectable HBV-DNA by quantitative PCR (cut-off at 2.3 log10, MONITOR COBAS, Roche) and normal ALT values.
In January 2002, after 24 months of uninterrupted lamivudine treatment, HBV-DNA became detectable by PCR (2.6 log10), and, in June 2002, a viral breakthrough was documented when HBV-DNA rose to 9.2 log10 with ALT at 2.7 ULN. The patient was asymptomatic. Sequencing of the HBV polymerase revealed two common lamivudine resistant mutations – rtL180M and rtM204V. Adefovir dipivoxil, 10 mg/day, was added to the ongoing lamivudine treatment. The evolution of HBV viral load is shown in the Figure. Over the next 10 months, HBV-DNA never fell below 5 log10. In June 2003, the HBV-DNA titer was 5.28 log10. Lamivudine was then stopped, but adefovir was maintained; in addition, pegylated interferon α-2a was introduced (180 μg/week). In August 2003, and after five injections, the patient decided to stop pegylated interferon administration due to poor drug tolerance: anorexia, dry mouth, diarrhoea, weight loss and back pain. Thrombopenia was also detected.
After 4 months of uninterrupted adefovir monotherapy, HBV-DNA was still at 4.9 log10 and the same lamivudine resistant mutations were detected without adefovir resistant mutations. In September 2004, while on adefovir monotherapy, and 15 months after having stopped lamivudine and 13 months after having stopped pegylated interferon, HBV-DNA rose to 8.3 log10, ALT to 10 ULN and aspartate aminotransferase to 7 ULN. Prothrombin time was 78%, and total bilirubin and serum albumin were normal. Two adefovir resistant mutations, rtA181T and rtN236T, were detected, whereas previous lamivudine resistant mutations, rtL180M and rtM204V, were absent. Anti-HDV and anti-HCV antibodies detection remained negative.
A test trial of a higher dose of adefovir (20 mg/day) was started. One month later, HBV-DNA was at 7 log10 and ALT levels remained unchanged. The patient's condition deteriorated with the occurrence of oedema, ascites, jaundice, mild renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 110 μmol/l) and decreased prothrombin time (47% of normal). Tenofovir fumarate was then started at a dose of 300 mg/day, while adefovir was continued for one month at 10 mg/day and then stopped. Two months later, HBV-DNA became undetectable by PCR, prothrombin time rose to 90% while jaundice and ascites resolved. HBV-DNA was still undetectable by PCR after 8 months of tenofovir treatment, on three separate occasions. The patient is currently listed for liver transplantation.","[[55.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['liver', 'oesophageal', 'mouth', 'back', 'renal', 'liver']","['HBV cirrhosis', 'hepatitis delta virus', 'HDV', 'hepatitis C virus', 'HCV', 'human immunodeficiency virus', 'HIV', 'infection', 'Cirrhosis', 'oesophageal varices', 'viral breakthrough', 'asymptomatic', 'common lamivudine resistant mutations', 'poor drug tolerance', 'anorexia', 'dry mouth', 'diarrhoea', 'weight loss', 'back pain', 'Thrombopenia', 'lamivudine resistant mutations', 'adefovir resistant mutations', 'adefovir resistant mutations', 'rtA181T', 'rtN236T', 'lamivudine resistant mutations', 'rtL180M', 'rtM204V', 'condition deteriorated', 'oedema', 'ascites', 'jaundice', 'renal insufficiency', 'decreased prothrombin time', 'jaundice', 'ascites']","['lamivudine', 'Lamivudine', 'lamivudine', 'Adefovir dipivoxil', 'lamivudine', 'Lamivudine', 'adefovir', 'pegylated interferon', 'adefovir', 'adefovir', 'adefovir', 'lamivudine', 'pegylated interferon', 'adefovir', 'Tenofovir fumarate', 'adefovir', 'tenofovir']","['1997', '55', 'August 1998', 'February 1999', 'January 2000', 'January 2002', 'June 2002', 'June 2003', 'August 2003', 'September 2004', 'rtA181T', 'rtL180M']","['liver biopsy', 'Child Pugh score', 'HBe antigen', 'HBe antibody', 'HBV viral load', 'HBV-DNA', 'Digene hybrid capture assay', 'HBV genotype', 'Alanine aminotransferase', 'ALT', 'HBV-DNA', 'Digene assay', 'qualitative PCR', 'treatment', 'HBV-DNA', 'ALT', 'treatment', 'HBV-DNA', 'quantitative PCR', 'ALT', 'HBV-DNA', 'PCR', 'HBV-DNA', 'log10', 'ALT', 'Sequencing of the HBV polymerase', 'evolution of HBV viral load', 'HBV viral load', 'HBV-DNA', 'HBV-DNA titer', 'injections', 'HBV-DNA', 'adefovir monotherapy', 'HBV-DNA', 'ALT', 'aspartate aminotransferase', 'Prothrombin time', 'total bilirubin', 'serum albumin', 'Anti-HDV and anti-HCV antibodies detection', 'HBV-DNA', 'ALT levels', 'serum creatinine', 'prothrombin time', 'HBV-DNA', 'PCR', 'prothrombin time', 'HBV-DNA', 'PCR', 'liver transplantation']","['August 1998', 'January 2002', 'next 10 months', 'August 2003', 'September 2004', 'September 2004', 'One month later', 'One month later', 'Two months later', 'currently']"

The lesion had been diagnosed initialing as gingivitis by the private oral surgeon and treated with local topical medicines without any remission.
At the age of seven the patient was recovered for an orthopaedic trauma. He had been diagnosed with FA at the age of seven after that pancytopenia was noticed during routine blood examinations for orthodontic trauma. He had been treated with androgenic therapy and had not received a bone marrow transplant. The haematological test revealed an early stage of pancytopenia (3,4 × 109/l, Hb 12,3 g/dl, and platelets 13 × 109/l).
Oral examination revealed a relatively well-defined, nearly circular, concave ulcer measuring 3 × 4 cm, which extended from the hard palatal mucosa in the upper molar region to the adjacent soft palatal mucosa. The surface was erythematous and smooth, with some telangiectasias. Clinical examination showed no regional lymphadenopathy. CT and MR imaging showed a hard and soft tissue mass extending from molar region mucosa to the soft palate mucosa. The nasopharynx appeared normal (Figure ). No significant cervical lymphadenopathy was seen on the images. An incisional biopsy performed under local anaesthesia revealed a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (Figure ).
The tumor was surgically removed with a right partial maxillectomy extendiney to homolateral soft mucosa and clear magins. Reconstruction was accomplished with a temporalis muscle flap.

She was randomised to receive intraoperative radiotherapy as a second procedure. However, the attending anaesthetist felt that because of the history of severe ischaemic heart disease a second general anaesthetic should be avoided. The patient was keen to take the intraoperative radiotherapy to which she was randomised, rather than come every day for radiotherapy for 6 weeks; she was willing to undergo the whole procedure under local anaesthetic.
She received temazepam (10 mg), preoperatively. She was given midazolam 1 mg i.v. just prior to infiltration of the scar (just the skin) with 1% lignocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline and 0.5% marcaine in a ration of 1:1. During the infiltration she breathed a 50:50 mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide, followed by oxygen @ 6 L/min via Hudson mask.
The cavity was opened and radiotherapy applicator positioned with a purse string suture as usual. The patient did not feel any pain and tolerated the procedure well (figure ).

The otolaryngologist diagnosed chronic sinusitis based on the clinical exam and CT imaging. The planned surgery included bilateral endoscopic ethmoidectomy, bilateral middle meatus antrostomy and left inferior turbinate cautery.
During the right posterior ethmoid exploration, a 2 mm tissue fragment was removed for histopathological analysis. Cerebrospinal fluid was observed leaking from the surgical biopsy site. The apparent opening in the cribriform plate was sealed with gelfoam and the remainder of the procedure completed.
With concern for a CSF leak an unenhanced CT was obtained post-operatively revealing intracranial penetration and hemorrhage (Figure ). The 2 mm tissue sample obtained during the procedure was identified as normal cerebral white matter. In the recovery room, the patient awakened without difficulty in ""satisfactory condition with intact vision.""
Neurosurgical consultation one day after surgery described slight drowsiness and minimal left upper extremity drift. She was empirically started on fosphenytoin and antibiotics. The following day her drift had resolved and she appeared less lethargic.
The remainder of the hospitalization was uncomplicated and she was discharged seven days later after completing her course of antibiotics. She took valproic acid for seizure prophylaxis for several days at home, but this was discontinued due to adverse effects.
An MRI scan two weeks later (Figure ) documented evolution of the hemorrhage. Restricted diffusion along the course of the injury (image not shown) indicated tissue infarction. A brain MRI three months after surgery (Figure ) revealed resolution of the hemorrhage with residual encephalomalacia along the path of injury involving the right caudate, medial internal capsule and anterior right thalamus.
Over the ensuing months the family reported that the patient's personality had changed. They described her as apathetic, mildly depressed, emotionally labile and irritable. She herself complained of having no energy and seemed to have lost interest in life and those activities that had previously stimulated her. Prior to the surgery she had worked full time as an aide in a center for learning disabled children plus an additional 20 hours weekly as an aide in a home health agency. She also was involved extensively with her church and community activities. After recovering from the surgery she was unable to return to work. She would sit at home and do nothing. She did not even wish to drive her car any longer. She also felt that her cognitive abilities had declined significantly. She complained of difficulty with attention and concentration. Although she reported no decline in memory, her family did notice that she was more forgetful.
The patient was evaluated 6 months after the injury by a rehabilitation neuropsychiatrist who found that she was apathetic, had ""blunted and constricted affect"" and specifically showed ""no evidence of neuro-vegetative symptoms of depression."" Based on this assessment, the neuropsychiatrist actually discontinued Prozac treatment started by other physicians and initiated therapy instead with amantadine. The same clinician continued to interact with her until 28 months after surgery and never observed any clinically significant depression. More extensive neuropsychological testing was performed at a different facility 32 months after surgery and concluded again, that the patient's primary cause of cognitive impairment and resultant loss of functionality resulted from an abulic syndrome and not depression. While the patient scored for mild to moderate depression on the Beck Depression Inventory-11, most of the score was based on symptoms that coexist with abulia such as decreased interest in people or activities, loss of pleasure, decreased energy, concentration, motivation and initiative. However, the patient actually scored low on symptoms that are exclusive to depression such as feelings of sadness, worthlessness, guilt and hopelessness. Her apathy, lack of motivation and initiative were the changes that dramatically stood out. Thus it was possible to distinguish clearly between abulia and depression. The ultimate conclusion was that our patient had primary abulia with some depression secondary to her self-perceived change in personality. This fit well with her own assessment. She described her mood as a response to the different person she had become and her inability to live life as she was once able. These neuropsychological tests also revealed other complex functions affected by the injury, namely ""executive dysfunction and mild disinhibition."" The abulia responded partially to amantadine, 100 mg daily, however, the patient reported that if she missed a few doses her difficulties with initiation and motivation would soon return.","[[57.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['ear', 'bilateral middle meatus', 'middle meatus', 'left inferior turbinate', 'right posterior ethmoid', 'tissue fragment', 'Cerebrospinal fluid', 'surgical biopsy site', 'cribriform plate', 'CSF', 'intracranial', 'tissue', 'cerebral white matter', 'left upper extremity', 'tissue', 'brain', 'right caudate', 'medial internal capsule', 'anterior right thalamus']","['healthy', 'ear infections', 'sinusitis', 'sinusitis', 'Cerebrospinal fluid was observed leaking from the surgical biopsy site', 'apparent opening in the cribriform plate', 'CSF leak', 'penetration', 'hemorrhage', 'normal cerebral white matter', 'awakened', 'satisfactory condition', 'intact vision', 'drowsiness', 'left upper extremity drift', 'drift', 'lethargic', 'adverse effects', 'hemorrhage', 'Restricted diffusion', 'injury', 'tissue infarction', 'hemorrhage', 'encephalomalacia', 'path of injury', 'personality had changed', 'apathetic', 'depressed', 'emotionally labile', 'irritable', 'energy', 'lost interest in life', 'unable to return to work', 'sit at home and do nothing', 'cognitive abilities had declined significantly', 'difficulty with attention and concentration', 'decline in memory', 'forgetful', 'injury', 'apathetic', 'blunted and constricted affect', 'neuro-vegetative symptoms of depression', 'depression', 'cognitive impairment', 'loss of functionality', 'abulic', 'abulic syndrome', 'depression', 'depression', 'symptoms', 'abulia', 'decreased interest in people or activities', 'loss of pleasure', 'decreased energy, concentration, motivation and initiative', 'symptoms', 'depression', 'feelings of sadness', 'worthlessness', 'guilt', 'hopelessness', 'apathy', 'lack of motivation', 'lack of motivation and initiative', 'initiative', 'abulia', 'depression', 'primary abulia', 'depression', 'self-perceived change in personality', 'mood as a response to the different person she had become', 'inability to live life as she was once able', 'other complex functions affected by the injury', 'complex functions affected by the injury', 'executive dysfunction', 'disinhibition', 'abulia', 'difficulties with initiation and motivation']","['fosphenytoin', 'valproic acid', 'Prozac', 'amantadine', 'amantadine']",['57'],"['CT imaging', 'bilateral endoscopic ethmoidectomy', 'bilateral middle meatus antrostomy', 'middle meatus antrostomy', 'left inferior turbinate cautery', 'right posterior ethmoid exploration', '2 mm tissue fragment was removed', 'histopathological analysis', 'apparent opening in the cribriform plate was sealed with gelfoam', 'procedure', 'unenhanced CT', 'procedure', 'surgery', 'antibiotics', 'antibiotics', 'seizure prophylaxis', 'MRI scan', 'brain MRI', 'surgery', 'surgery', 'surgery', 'therapy', 'surgery', 'neuropsychological testing', 'surgery', 'Beck Depression Inventory-11', 'neuropsychological tests']","['post-operatively', 'two weeks later', 'three months', 'three months after surgery', 'Over the ensuing months', '6 months', '28 months', '32 months']"

These episodes would occur at 3–4 Hz, lasting for 1 to 2 minutes each in duration, and occur about once per month for the past 5 months, precipitated by standing up and extending the neck. At the time of the episodes, the patient also felt numbness in his left arm leading to decreased strength and a tremor of 3–4 Hz. Consciousness was never impaired and there was no other symptom. The patient had a past history of diabetes and hypertension, and was on anti-hypertensive and oral hypoglycemic medications. On examination the patient was found to have no neurological deficit. However, upon standing and extension of the neck, the patient became dizzy and felt numbness in his left arm. In addition, a swinging tremor of 3–4 Hz was noted in the same arm. These symptoms resolved on sitting.
Further investigations were needed. Interictal electroencephalography (EEG) and Video-EEG were normal, while EMG and nerve conduction studies revealed findings suggestive of mild peripheral sensory motor polyneuropathy. MRI of the brain was found to be normal; however, MRA of the anterior circulation revealed lack of flow signals in the right internal carotid artery consistent with complete occlusion. There was good compensatory filling of right anterior and middle cerebral arteries via cross flow from left internal carotid artery. Consistent with the above findings, Doppler ultrasound of the neck showed complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery, with normal right common carotid, external carotid, and vertebral arteries. The diagnosis of low flow TIA was made.

He had undergone right radical nephrectomy in July 2002, and renal cell carcinoma, T1aN0M0, stage I, had been diagnosed. Medical follow-ups had been conducted routinely without any treatment. In May 2004, after he experienced anterior chest pain, computed tomography (CT) was performed. This revealed in the sternum a low density mass that gradually increased in size during the following three months. In September 2004, there was an 8 × 7 cm mass, and destruction of some of the cortical bone of the manubrium sterni had occurred, so a CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy was performed. (Fig. ) The mass was composed of clear tumor cells arranged in an alveolar configuration, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed histologically. (Fig. ) We performed distant metastasis check up and check his physical function preparing for an operation. No evidence of other distant metastases was seen. We took a chest CT prior to the operation after an admission, the tumor shadow was the same comparing with previous chest CT before the biopsy. The patient underwent a partial resection of the sternal bone with wide margin including whole tumor tissue in November 2004. The postoperative clinical course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 11 days later. Pathological examination revealed only granulation tissue which composed of wide bleeding area and necrosis area with strong infiltration of inflammatory cells especially for fibroblasts. The entire resected tissue specimen was checked carefully, but no carcinoma cells were detected.

310,1379634-1,16412230,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1379634.xml,Factor VII deficiency and developmental abnormalities in a patient with partial monosomy of 13q and trisomy of 16p: case report and review of the literature,"A 9 year-old male presented with Factor VII deficiency and multiple congenital abnormalities. Prior to her pregnancy with this child, his mother (currently 50 years old) had nine in vitro fertilization attempts that ended in miscarriage. One of these miscarriages was documented as trisomy 21 at 18 weeks gestation. This patient was one twin of a fraternal twin pregnancy conceived on the 10th round of in vitro fertilization. His sister was born healthy and her cytogenetic evaluation has not been performed. This twin pregnancy was complicated by premature labor requiring 13 weeks of maternal bed rest prior to delivery via C-section at 36 weeks gestation. The patient's birth weight was 3 lbs, 14.5 oz and his Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.
At birth, the patient was noted to have an imperforate anus that was repaired with a colostomy at 15 days of life. An ultrasound of the brain showed agenesis of the corpus callosum, which was later confirmed on MRI. Both an echocardiogram and a renal ultrasound were normal.
For the first year of life, the patient failed to thrive. He underwent two successful operations for his imperforate anus at ages 9 and 11 months, after which he began to gain weight appropriately. Development was delayed; he sat at 9 months, pulled up at 11 months, walked at 22 months, and spoke single words at 15 months. His pediatricians noted ""borderline microcephaly"" and low muscle tone. He has been receiving speech therapy and physical therapy since age 1. At age 6 years, he developed grand mal seizures which have been successfully managed with medication. He had repeated upper respiratory infections and was noted to have enlarged tonsils that may have contributed to sleep apnea. As part of his pre-operative work-up for tonsillectomy, he was discovered to have elevated prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times of 21.3 seconds and 36.8 seconds, respectively. Factor VII deficiency (17% of normal) was subsequently diagnosed; Factor X levels were 54% of normal. The patient, however, has never had a severe bleeding disorder. It was the combination of Factor VII deficiency and multiple congenital malformations that prompted the genetics work-up, including karyotype. He had abnormal tooth eruption and required dental surgery and frenulectomy. Neither surgery required coagulation assistance.
The patient's parents are healthy, as is his fraternal twin sister and a younger brother, age 7. Review of systems was notable for chronic constipation requiring daily enemas. He is currently on Depakote 325 mg bid and has no known drug allergies.
On physical examination (Figure ), the patient's height is 51 inches (10th centile), his weight is 42 pounds (3rd centile) and his head circumference is 49.5 cm (<3rd centile, the 50th centile for a 2 year-old). His inner and outer canthal distances are at 97th centile. He has thick, curly hair with one hair whorl and a normal posterior hairline. His forehead is prominent and his face is triangular. His palpebral fissures are somewhat almond-shaped and upslanting. He has mild ptosis. He has a high nasal root, hypoplastic alae nasi with prominent columella, a thin upper lip, downturned corners of the mouth, and a small, pointed chin. He has some mild facial asymmetry. His ears are normally placed and rotated without tags or pits; however, there is a slightly flattened appearance to both auricles. His palate is high arched and he has a small notch in his uvula. He has several dental caps and his lower front teeth are abnormally rotated. His chest is normally shaped without pectus deformity. His chest circumference and inter-nipple distance were 50th and 75th centiles, respectively. He has multiple hypopigmented macules on his torso and one café-au-lait spot on his left shoulder measuring approximately 3 cm × 2 cm. He has approximately 10 degrees of scoliosis, mild lordosis and a small sacral dimple. There are surgical scars from his colostomy and anal repair. He has normal male genitalia, Tanner Stage 1. He has decreased elbow and shoulder extension. His distal extensibility is normal. His 5th fingers are slightly short relative to the 4th distal inter-phalangeal crease and show clinodactyly. His palmar creases are normal. Heart, lung, and abdominal examinations were normal. His knees were normal and he has pes planus.
On ophthalmologic examination, the patients best-corrected visual acuity is 20/50 OU with a +6.25 + 1.25 × 95 OD and +6.25 + 1.75 × 95 OS prescription. He has no measurable stereopsis. Color vision, ocular ductions, ocular alignment, pupillary examination, confrontational visual fields, and slit lamp examination were all normal. Dilated fundoscopic examination showed bilateral, mild optic nerve hypoplasia.
Endocrine studies, including a thyroid panel, a random cortisol, prolactin, and follicle-stimulating were within normal limits. The patient's bone age is at the upper limits of normal by Pyles and Greulich critreria.
Routine karyotyping showed a translocation of material of unknown origin onto 13q33 (Figure ). FISH probes for all telomeres were used to confirm the presence of an unbalanced translocation with distal 16p (16p13.3 → ptelomere) translocated to 13q33. Thus, the patient is monosomic for genes at 13q33 and distal, as well as trisomic for genes at 16p13.3. The nomenclature for this karyotype is 46, XY, der(13)t(13;16)(q33;p13.3). Because the transcription factor gene, ZIC2, lies close to the breakpoint and because mutations in ZIC2 are known to cause holoprosencephaly (a midline defect), we confirmed the breakpoints by performing FISH analysis using ZIC2 specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes, RPCI 11 12-G12 selected from NCBI and Ensembl databases (BACPAC Resources, Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA). These FISH studies confirmed that ZIC2 was present on both chromosome 13's and that the breakpoint was distal to 13q32, consistent with our impression that the breakpoint is at 13q33. Cytogenetic analysis of both parents was recommended given the history of previous miscarriages, but has not yet been pursued by the family.","[[9.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['anus', 'brain', 'corpus callosum', 'renal', 'anus', 'muscle', 'upper respiratory', 'tonsils', 'tooth', 'dental', 'head', 'inner and outer canthal', 'hair', 'hair', 'posterior hairline', 'forehead', 'face', 'palpebral fissures', 'nasal root', 'alae nasi', 'columella', 'upper lip', 'corners of the mouth', 'chin', 'facial', 'ears', 'both auricles', 'palate', 'uvula', 'dental', 'lower front teeth', 'chest', 'chest', 'inter-nipple', 'torso', 'left shoulder', 'sacral', 'anal', 'male genitalia', 'elbow', 'shoulder', '5th fingers', '4th distal inter-phalangeal crease', 'palmar creases', 'Heart', 'lung', 'abdominal', 'knees', 'OU', 'OD', 'OS', 'ocular', 'ocular', 'pupillary', 'optic nerve', 'Endocrine', 'thyroid', 'bone', '13q33', 'all telomeres', 'distal 16p', '13q33 and distal', ""both chromosome 13's"", 'distal to 13q32', '13q33']","['Factor VII deficiency', 'congenital abnormalities', 'pregnancy', 'miscarriage', 'miscarriages', 'trisomy 21', 'gestation', 'fraternal twin pregnancy', 'healthy', 'twin pregnancy', 'premature labor', 'gestation', 'imperforate anus', 'agenesis of the corpus callosum', 'failed to thrive', 'imperforate anus', 'gain weight', 'Development was delayed', 'sat', 'pulled up', 'walked', 'spoke single words', 'microcephaly', 'low muscle tone', 'grand mal seizures', 'upper respiratory infections', 'enlarged tonsils', 'sleep apnea', 'Factor VII deficiency', 'bleeding disorder', 'Factor VII deficiency', 'congenital malformations', 'karyotype', 'abnormal tooth eruption', 'healthy', 'constipation', 'thick', 'curly hair', 'one hair whorl', 'normal posterior hairline', 'forehead is prominent', 'face is triangular', 'almond-shaped', 'upslanting', 'ptosis', 'high nasal root', 'hypoplastic alae nasi', 'prominent columella', 'thin upper lip', 'downturned corners', 'downturned corners of the mouth', 'pointed chin', 'facial asymmetry', 'ears are normally placed and rotated', 'tags', 'pits', 'flattened appearance', 'palate is high arched', 'notch', 'dental caps', 'lower front teeth are abnormally rotated', 'normally shaped', 'pectus deformity', 'hypopigmented macules', 'café-au-lait spot', 'scoliosis', 'lordosis', 'sacral dimple', 'surgical scars', 'normal male genitalia', 'decreased elbow and shoulder extension', 'shoulder extension', 'distal extensibility is normal', 'short', 'clinodactyly', 'palmar creases are normal', 'knees were normal', 'pes planus', 'stereopsis', 'optic nerve hypoplasia', 'bone age is at the upper limits of normal', 'translocation of material of unknown origin onto 13q33', 'unbalanced translocation', 'translocated to 13q33', 'monosomic for genes at 13q33 and distal', 'trisomic for genes', 'trisomic for genes at 16p13.3', 'karyotype', 'transcription factor gene, ZIC2, lies close to the breakpoint', 'ZIC2, lies close to the breakpoint', 'mutations in ZIC2', 'holoprosencephaly', 'midline defect', 'ZIC2', 'breakpoint', 'breakpoint', 'miscarriages']",['Depakote'],"['9', '50', '10th', '9', '11', '1', '6', '7', '11 12', 'Ensembl databases', ""BACPAC Resources, Children's Hospital"", 'Oakland Research Institute, Oakland', 'ZIC2']","['vitro fertilization', 'vitro fertilization', 'cytogenetic evaluation', 'maternal bed rest', 'delivery via C-section', 'birth weight', 'Apgar scores', 'imperforate anus that was repaired with a colostomy', 'ultrasound of the brain', 'MRI', 'echocardiogram', 'renal ultrasound', 'operations for his imperforate anus', 'speech therapy', 'physical therapy', 'medication', 'work-up', 'tonsillectomy', 'prothrombin', 'partial thromboplastin times', 'Factor X levels', 'genetics work-up', 'karyotype', 'dental surgery', 'frenulectomy', 'coagulation', 'enemas', 'physical examination', 'height', 'weight', 'head circumference', 'inner and outer canthal distances', 'chest circumference', 'inter-nipple distance', 'colostomy', 'anal repair', 'ophthalmologic examination', 'visual acuity', 'Color vision', 'ocular ductions', 'ocular alignment', 'pupillary examination', 'confrontational visual fields', 'slit lamp examination', 'Dilated fundoscopic examination', 'Endocrine studies', 'thyroid panel', 'random cortisol', 'prolactin', 'follicle-stimulating', 'karyotyping', 'FISH probes for all telomeres', 'FISH analysis', 'FISH studies', 'Cytogenetic analysis']","['18 weeks', '18 weeks', '36 weeks', '9 months', '11 months', '22 months', '15 months', 'pre-operative', 'currently']"

Genotyping of polymorphic markers indicated maternal UPD for chromosome 14, including isodisomy for proximal markers and heterodisomy for distal markers. Additionally, there was mosaic trisomy 14 detected in 5% of blood lymphocytes. We obtained a lymphoblastoid cell line (identifier X_1054), purified genomic DNA and performed SNP array analysis. Uniparental isodisomy was evident by a large region of homozygous calls (blue dots), high LOH (grey background), and significant p values (yellow lines)(Fig. , bottom row). We calculated that the copy number for chromosome 14 was 2.19 (3.2% higher than the copy number for other autosomes in this case); however, we did not independently confirm the presence of trisomy in these lymphoblasts, and in general this limited degree of mosaic trisomy does not permit visual identification of subtle copy number changes.","[[9.0, 'year']]",F,2006,[],"['de novo Robertsonian translocation t', 'short stature', 'developmental delay', 'symptoms', 'maternal UPD', 'maternal UPD for chromosome 14', 'isodisomy for proximal markers', 'heterodisomy for distal markers', 'mosaic trisomy 14', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'Uniparental isodisomy', 'homozygous calls', 'LOH', 'p values', 'autosomes', 'trisomy', 'lymphoblasts', 'mosaic trisomy', 'subtle copy number changes']",[],['Antonarakis'],"['Genotyping of polymorphic markers', 'isodisomy for proximal markers', 'blood lymphocytes', 'SNP array analysis', 'chromosome 14']",[]

A case report and review of the literature,"A 62-year-old woman with a past history of adenocarcinoma of the rectum and genital cancer, underwent abdominoperineal resection with a permanent left ostomy and total hysterectomy in the age of 37. Some 9 years later she was found to have colonic polyps with malignant transformation and was treated by surgical resection (colotomy and polypectomy).
In 1993 and 1997 she was found to have benign colonic polyps which were excised endoscopically, and in March and June 2003 she was referred to our surgical outpatient department with subcutaneus lesions, first on the left side of the abdominal wall and then on the right buttock. The lesions were excised under local anesthesia and were reported to be sebaceous adenomas, and the diagnosis of the Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) was suggested. Ever since the patient was commenced on surveillance program that included annual clinical examination, CEA evaluation, chest radiography, urine cytology, colonoscopy and mammography.
In June 2005, an adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon was detected. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease or paraaortic lymphadenopathy. A right hemicolectomy was performed, and the pathology report confirmed a poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma (stage II, T3N0M0, Dukes B). Screening tests for further malignancies, including chest radiography and upper GI endoscopy were all negative, and none of the tumor markers were elevated.
The patient has twin sons both of whom are in their early forties and currently healthy. She had three siblings from that only one brother is alive without cancerous history. One brother underwent a subtotal gastrectomy in his forties for gastric cancer and died in his fifties of a metachronous primary gastric cancer in the oesophagogastric junction. Another brother is alive, who has undergone a colon resection twice, first in his twenties and then 22 years later for colon cancer, and has a history of multiple sebaceous adenomas. Her mother had undergone a colon resection in her forties for colon cancer and developed at least seven primary cancers of colon, genitourinary, upper GI tract, sebaceous adenomas-epitheliomas, during a 21-year period. She died in her sixties of a second gastric cancer. Her grandfather died in his forties from colon cancer. Further family history is less clear, but the patient believes that some other members of her family died of cancers at various sites. Ages at diagnosis of cancer ranged from 29 to 62 years (median age: 48 years).

The patient had smoked half a packet of cigarettes per day for the past 10 years and had been diagnosed four years previously with adrenoleukodystrophy. During August and September of 2004, the patient travelled to Corona, California. The symptoms began while at this location, and he was subsequently treated for bacterial pneumonia at an area hospital. However, his symptoms worsened rapidly and he returned to Korea.
On admission to the hospital, the following vital signs were observed: temperature, 37.8°C; blood pressure, 130/70 mmHg; pulse, 92 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min. A clinical examination revealed a moderately ill-appearing male with multiple, encrusted, erythematous, papular nodules on the face and trunk. There were no other remarkable findings on examination. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with eosinophilia (white blood cell count 23,460 cells/μl; eosinophils 22%), an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (100 mm/h), and increased levels of C-reactive protein (24.7 mg/dl). A chest X-ray (CXR) and computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed tiny, multiple nodules in both lung fields (Figure , top). Sputum acid-fast bacillus stain and tuberculosis culture were both negative. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and a skin punch biopsy. The biopsy revealed the presence of a chronic granuloma with thick-walled, mature spherules containing endospores. A subsequent skin tissue culture grew Coccidioides immitis. The patient's serum complement fixation (CF) titre was 1:16, and a serum coccidioidal immunodiffusion test for IgG antibody was negative. (All coccidioidal CF antibody testing was carried out at the laboratory of Lynn A. Cheryk, Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, USA). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed no evidence of meningitis.
The patient was diagnosed with diffuse coccidioidal pneumonia with skin involvement and was treated with amphotericin B deoxycholate (total dosage, 1970 mg; ~1 mg/kg) for 40 days (day five to day 45 of hospitalization). However, the patient still complained of night sweats and a cough. Physical examination revealed a persistent fever (temperature of 38.6–39°C) and no improvement of the skin rash. His general condition progressively deteriorated. The patient developed a right pleural effusion and miliary shadows on the CXR did not improve. A follow-up CF titre performed on day 27 of hospitalization had increased to 1:64. On day 45 of hospitalization, the therapy was changed to caspofungin (initially 70 mg and then 50 mg/day, given intravenously) and fluconazole (400 mg/day, given orally). Sixteen days after the combination treatment (day 60 of hospitalization), a CXR revealed a reduction in both the miliary nodes and the pleural effusion. The patient improved initially, developing only occasional fevers. Forty-nine days after the combination therapy, the patient's peak body temperature fell below 38°C, and the dyspnea had subsided. The serum CF antibody titre had decreased to 1:8. However, the cough remained. By day 125 of the combination treatment, the patient had defervesced, and all of his respiratory symptoms subsided. Although some skin lesions still remained on his face, most were nearly resolved. The serum CF antibody titre was undetectable, and on day 131, caspofungin therapy was discontinued. The patient was subsequently treated with only fluconazole at a dose of 400 mg/day. There were no drug-related side effects noted from the use of the caspofungin and fluconazole. On day 194, his follow-up CF antibody titre increased to 1:256. However, the patient did not experience respiratory symptoms, develop a skin rash, or develop abnormalities on CXR. A follow-up examination five months following completion of the combination treatment revealed minimal residual nodules visible on CXR and CT scan (Figure , bottom). The patient's CF antibody titre was 1:128. As of September 2005, the patient was clinically healthy and without any respiratory symptoms and/or fevers.

The patient was presented with ingestion of 450 grams of saluted plaster for suicidal attempt. She had eaten the plaster solution seven hours before. The main complaints of the patient were vague epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting.
The Patient had two history of unsuccessful suicidal attempt before. However, beyond all our expectations she had not undergone psychiatric management. She neither smoked nor was an alcoholic, or drug addict.

Chest and abdominal physical exams were normal except for a bulging in upper abdomen and a palpable hard mass filling the epigasteric and left upper quadrant area. Laboratory tests were normal.
Plain abdominal radiography showed an opaque bezoar as a picture of stomach (Figure-). According to upper GI flexible endoscopy, esophagus was normal, but endoscope could not enter the stomach. A huge whitish foreign body was seen in stomach. We tried to insert nasogastric tube for irrigation, but it was not successful. The patient was scheduled for emergent surgical exploration.
Abdomen was opened with upper midline incision. Abdominal exploration was normal. Outer layer of stomach and serosa were normal, but there was a huge hard mass filling the whole cavity of stomach. With longitudinal gastrotomy in greater curvature, stomach was opened. From stomach a round, hard, whitish foreign body was removed (Figure-). The mucosa was intact. After saline irrigation, stomach was repaired in two layers. Nasogastric tube was inserted.

Nasal endoscopy revealed at the right inferior turbinate head a rounded neoplasm about 1 cm in diameter, pink in color, soft, not bleeding and not tender on palpation, covered with apparently healthy mucosa (Fig. ). No other remarkable alterations in the other areas of the nasal cavity were found; the nasopharynx presented scars from a tonsillectomy performed when the patient was 7 years old.
Oropharyngeal, laryngoscopic and otoscopic evaluations were normal.
Active anterior rhinomanometry (150 Pascal) disclosed mildly elevated nasal resistance in both nasal sinuses; on decongestion testing with naphazoline values returned to normal in the left but not in the right nasal fossa (0.36 and 0.78, respectively).
The Prick test ruled out allergy toward common trophic and aeroallergens.
Cytologic studies of nasal scrapings obtained with the Rhino-probe® were performed on specimens taken from the neoplasm and the mucosa of the inferior turbinate of both nasal cavities.
The cellular material was fixed in 95% ethyl alcohol for 4 minutes, and then stained using the May-Grünwald-Giemsa technique.
Slide observations were conducted at ×400 and ×1000 magnification.
Cytological determination disclosed a microscopic picture characterized by numerous clusters containing columnar cells with cytomegaly 5 to 6 times larger than normal (Fig. ). The cellular elements were characterized by increased volume and pronounced multinucleation (12 nuclei were counted in some cells), vesicular chromatin with one or several nucleoli in the nucleus (Fig. ).
The columnar multinuclear cells presented markedly a sparse and shortened ciliary ultrastructure.
Most of the multinuclear cells exhibited the following characteristics in the cytoplasm:
- an acidophil area of the apical region of the cytoplasm, with coarsely triangular morphology, with the apex oriented toward the nucleus.
- a small rounded weakly staining area.
Multinucleation was also evident in the muciparous goblet cells, where nuclear chromatin was prominent due to the cytoplasma mucin pressing on the nuclei (Fig. ).
Also present were columnar cells with a large acidophil intracytoplasmic vacuole. In some cells acidophilia was particularly intense in the center of the vacuole (Fig. , ).
The vacuoles were positive for PAS staining.
Cellular alterations were found in all cytological specimens.
Based on the clinical and cytological findings, further serologic studies were performed to search for viral infection. Serologic tests were performed on blood serum and on nasal and pharyngeal smears using the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to search for HHV6, VRS and EBV.
The serology detected an EBV infection, with viral presence on the nasal and pharyngeal smears and on the blood polymorphonucleates. Tests for HHV6 and VRS were negative.
The neoplasm was removed by endoscopy in local anesthesia. The histology report of the Institute of Anatomy and Histologic Pathology stated ""fragment of nasal mucosa with pronounced angiectatic-edematous aspects of the stroma and inflammatory infiltration of the lymphoplasma cells and eosinophilia"".
The ultrastructure study for the search for virus or viral particles conducted by the Electron Microscopy Center of the National Research Council, University of Bari, detected the presence of viral particles inside the cells of the nasal mucosa (Fig. ).
At 3 months after initial examination, the patient returned for an outpatient control visit; nasal cytology monitoring and laboratory tests remained positive for EBV infection. At 19 months after the initial presentation, the infection finally cleared.","[[21.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['right nasal fossa', 'nasal', 'Nasal', 'right inferior turbinate head', 'mucosa', 'nasal cavity', 'nasopharynx', 'Oropharyngeal', 'nasal', 'both nasal sinuses', 'right nasal fossa', 'nasal', 'neoplasm', 'mucosa of the inferior turbinate of both nasal cavities', 'nasal', 'cellular material', 'nucleus', 'columnar multinuclear cells', 'ciliary', 'multinuclear cells', 'cytoplasm', 'acidophil area of the apical region of the cytoplasm', 'apex', 'nucleus', 'muciparous goblet cells', 'nuclei', 'nasal', 'pharyngeal', 'nasal', 'pharyngeal', 'fragment of nasal mucosa', 'stroma', 'cells of the nasal mucosa', 'nasal']","['non-smoker', 'nasal obstruction of the right nasal fossa', 'symptoms', 'hyposomia', 'rhinorrhea', 'epistaxis', 'allergy', 'rhinosinus inflammation', 'neoplasm', 'bleeding', 'tender on palpation', 'healthy mucosa', 'remarkable alterations', 'scars', 'Oropharyngeal, laryngoscopic and otoscopic evaluations were normal', 'elevated nasal resistance', 'allergy toward common trophic and aeroallergens', 'common trophic', 'aeroallergens', 'clusters', 'columnar cells', 'cytomegaly', 'cellular elements', 'pronounced multinucleation', '12 nuclei were counted in some cells', 'vesicular chromatin', 'nucleoli in the nucleus', 'columnar multinuclear cells', 'sparse', 'shortened ciliary ultrastructure', 'multinuclear cells exhibited the following characteristics in the cytoplasm', 'acidophil area of the apical region of the cytoplasm', 'triangular morphology', 'apex oriented toward the nucleus', 'staining area', 'Multinucleation', 'nuclear chromatin was prominent', 'cytoplasma mucin pressing on the nuclei', 'columnar cells', 'acidophil intracytoplasmic vacuole', 'cells acidophilia', 'vacuoles', 'PAS staining', 'Cellular alterations', 'viral infection', 'HHV6', 'VRS', 'EBV', 'EBV infection', 'viral presence', 'neoplasm', 'angiectatic-edematous aspects of the stroma', 'inflammatory infiltration of the lymphoplasma cells', 'eosinophilia', 'virus', 'viral particles', 'viral particles inside the cells of the nasal mucosa', 'EBV infection', 'infection']",['ethyl alcohol'],"['21', '7', 'University of Bari']","['Nasal endoscopy', 'tonsillectomy', 'anterior rhinomanometry', 'anterior rhinomanometry (150 Pascal)', 'decongestion testing', 'naphazoline values', 'Prick test', 'Cytologic studies of nasal scrapings', 'Cytological determination', 'serologic studies', 'Serologic tests', 'blood serum', 'nasal and pharyngeal smears', 'nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)', 'serology', 'nasal and pharyngeal smears', 'blood polymorphonucleates', 'HHV6', 'VRS', 'neoplasm was removed by endoscopy in local anesthesia', 'endoscopy', 'local anesthesia', 'histology', 'Histologic Pathology', 'ultrastructure study', 'examination', 'nasal cytology monitoring', 'laboratory tests']",['1 year']

After a hip replacement 9 years ago the patient suffered from pulmonary embolization. Furthermore, there was a history of a conservatively treated bleeding gastric ulcer five years earlier.
Shortly after having had supper the patient was suddenly struck by severe epigastric pain and an intense nausea with a few vomits and frequent belching. The patient arrived at the emergency department in pre-chock. His abdomen was soft and non-distended but with severe tenderness to palpation in the epigastrium. A CT scan of thorax and abdomen showed a paraesophageal herniation into the right thorax containing a part of the transverse colon and a part of the distal stomach and proximal duodenum. A pronounced gastric distension was noted. No free fluid or gas was found in the abdominal cavity. Besides the herniation and an abundance of faecal content in the entire colon, the CT scan was normal (Fig. ).
The patient received a naso-gastric tube with an instantaneous drainage of 1000 ml of gastric content. A plain X-ray was performed to control the position of the naso-gastric tube which was adjusted to the gastric fundus. A naso-jejunal tube was placed by a guide-wire, passing the herniated and thereby intrathoracically positioned proximal duodenum (Fig. ).
The patient was taken to surgery the following day. Through a mid-line incision, the cardia was located in normal anatomic position and laterally a severely distended gastric fundus was noted. On the right side of the esophagus, half of the transverse colon was found in a paraesophageal hernia, with a diameter of the crural defect of 5 cm. Behind the colon, the distal stomach and proximal duodenum was found to have been pulled up into the hernia. A phrenotomy was performed and the undamaged and viable colon was pulled out of the hernia. The gastro-duodenal transition was tapered to the colon. On the ventral part of the proximal duodenum there was a punched-out benign perforated peptic ulcer with a diameter of 6 mm (Fig. ). By interrupted 3-0 Prolene® sutures, the peptic ulcer perforation was closed and covered by a viable part of the omentum. A large portion of the omentum was found devitalized and was therefore resected. Due to bleeding, a splenectomy was performed. The devitalized hernial sac containing several septa was excised and an opening to the right pleura was made to allow drainage of the mediastinal cavity above the diaphragm by a chest tube. The right and left crura were mobilized and the diaphragmatic defect was closed by interrupted 2-0 Prolene® sutures. To enforce the phrenoplasty and to minimize the risk of recurrence, a 360° Nissen fundoplication was performed. The patient received a jejunostomy tube for nutrition with the tip located 30 cm from the ligament of Treitz.
The patient was observed over-night in the ICU. To prevent infectious complications the patient received imipenem 500 mg × 3 i.v. for five days and as ulcer prophylaxis omeprazol 8 mg/h i.v. was given continuously. The chest-tube was removed on the fourth post-operative day. Eleven days after surgery the patient developed breathing problems with low saturation and tachycardia and a severe aspiration pneumonia was diagnosed and treated. The patient was discharged one month after surgery.
One month after discharge, the patient was followed-up at the out patient clinic and found to be in good shape and without nutritional problems. The jejunostomy tube was removed and the patient was put on life-long proton pump inhibition (T.

Cystoscopy and pelvic CT suggested a tumor of digestive tract origin invading the urinary bladder. The patient was referred to the Department of Digestive Surgery.
At the initial examination, height, was 160 cm; body weight, 63.5 kg; and body surface area, 1.89/m2. Performance status was grade 0. A fist-size tumor was palpable in the lower abdominal region. There was no particular past medical history or familial medical history.
At the initial examination, white blood cell count, was 7,600/μl; red blood cell count, 509 × 103/μl; hemoglobin, 16.4 g/dl; AST, 19 IU/l; ALT, 11 IU/l; creatinin clearance, 185.9 ml/min, C reactive protein, 2.19 mg/dl; CEA, 4.3 ng/ml; and CAl9-9, 7.3 U/ml. Bacterial culture of urine detected Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. No malignant cells were identified on urine cytoanalysis. Pelvic computerized tomography (CT) revealed a mass lesion measuring 8 cm was present in the pelvis, with direct invasion of the posterior wall of the urinary bladder. Abdominal CT detected no space-occupying lesion in the liver or swelling of peritoneal lymph nodes.
Colonoscopy revealed a 1/2-circumferential ulcerated tumor in the sigmoid colon, and a protuberant tumor was noted on the anal side of the main tumor. Histopathologically, both tumors were well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
99mTc-HMDP bone scintigraphy revealed many lesions with accumulation in the left ribs, which were diagnosed as multiple costal metastases (Figure ). Chest imaging showed no abnormal findings.
Based on the above findings, the diagnosis of T4, M1, stage IV sigmoid colon cancer was made (TNM classification), and curative resection was considered impossible.
Colostomy was performed on April 5, 2004, and chemotherapy with S-1 and CPT-11 was initiated on April 14. S-1 at 50 mg/m2 was administered orally from day 1 to day 14. CPT-11 at 40 mg/m2 was administered intravenously day 1 and 15. This treatment was followed by a 2 week rest, and was repeated every 4 weeks []. Since drug-induced liver dysfunction (grade 3) and diarrhea (grade 2) developed after completion of the 2nd cycle, the S-1 dose was reduced to 40 mg/m2 after their improvement, and 6 cycles of administration were performed in total (total dose: S-1: 7,560 mg as tegafur, CPT-11: 480 mg). This therapy resulted in resolution of the multiple costal metastases (Figure ), and a 50% reduction of the local lesion on CT. Down-staging to T3, M0, stage IIA was achieved, and curative resection was judged to be possible. A Sigmoidectomy, lymphadenectomy, and partial cystectomy were performed on January 22, 2005.
On histopathological examination the ulcerated tumor with a clear margin was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 3 × 3 cm. Subserous retention of mucus was noted, but the tumor was typed as pT2, ly0, v0, pN0, indicating the possibility of curative resection. Half of the tumor was degenerative, necrotic, and fibrotic (Figure and ). The additional cancer on the anal side was a 1.5 cm semipedunculated well-differentiated adenocarcinoma Tis.

Physical examination was unremarkable. Initial twelve-lead electrocardiogram displayed a 0.5 mm ST segment depression in leads V3 to V5, while cardiac markers showed elevated creatine kinase mass (32.8 ng/ml) and cardiac troponin (67.2 ng/ml). A diagnosis of a non-Q AMI was made. Because epigastric pain became worst, a new electrocardiogram was undertaken, revealing an 1 mm ST segment elevation in leads V2 to V5. Coronary angiography was then performed, which revealed 80% obstruction in left descendent anterior coronary artery, 90% obstruction in first diagonalis, 90% obstruction in right coronary artery and 90% obstruction in the second marginal branch of the circumflex coronary artery, with thrombus. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed in this artery and resulted in TIMI flow II.
In the third day post infarction, the patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram for the evaluation of left ventricular systolic function. The patient was asymptomatic, blood pressure was 120 × 80 mm Hg, and there were no signs of hemodynamic instability. Transthoracic echocardiogram disclosed mild left ventricular hypertrophy, a moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function due to lateral wall akinesia and severe hypokinesia of the inferior and posterior walls, and a small pericardial effusion. The lateral wall was thin but no signs of impeding left ventricular rupture was detected by two-dimensional imaging. The patient gave informed consent to participate in a research protocol to assess post AMI perfusion by myocardial contrast echocardiography.
Myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed in the third day post-infarction with a commercially available system (SONOS 5500, Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, Washington, USA) equipped with a broadband (1–3 MHz) transducer (S3) and power modulation imaging, which is a pulse cancellation technique that deploys multiple pulses per image line, alternating full- and half-amplitude pulses []. The system was adjusted to achieve optimal non-linear signal at a mechanical index of 0.2, frame rate ≥ 25 Hz. To assess the replenishment kinetics, microbubble destruction in the myocardium was induced by manually-deflagrated flash containing five consecutive high-mechanical index (1.0) impulses. Sequences of low-power myocardial perfusion images containing at least 15 cardiac cycles after the flash were acquired in the apical four-, two- and three-chamber views. The contrast agent used was PESDA (Perfluorocarbon Exposed Sonicated Dextrose and Albumin), which is constituted by albumin-encapsulated microbubbles with mean concentration of 1.4 × 109 microbubbles/ml and mean size of 4.6 ± 0.2 microns []. A total of 0.1 ml/Kg of contrast agent was diluted in 80 ml of 0.9% saline and administered by continuous intravenous infusion. Real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography demonstrated a perfusion defect in the lateral and inferior walls. In addition, the presence of contrast extrusion from the left ventricular cavity into the myocardium could be observed, forming a serpiginous duct extending from the endocardium to the epicardial region of the lateral wall, without communication with the pericardial space (Figure ). The hypothesis of an impending rupture of the left ventricular free wall was suggested, and the patient was taken to magnetic resonance within one hour. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the same image of contrast extrusion into the myocardium (Figure ), thus confirming the diagnosis. Urgent cardiac surgery was indicated. However, while waiting for surgery, the patient presented with cardiogenic shock followed by cardiorespiratory arrest. An immediate pericadiocentesis was performed, but it was followed by the patient's death in spite of resuscitation maneuvers. Anatomopathologic findings were consistent with AMI in the lateral wall and a left ventricular free wall rupture at the infarct site (Figure ), corresponding to the area seen by contrast echocardiography.","[[50.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['epigastric', 'cardiac', 'cardiac', 'epigastric', 'Coronary', 'left descendent anterior coronary artery', 'first diagonalis', 'right coronary artery', 'second marginal branch of the circumflex coronary', 'second marginal branch of the circumflex coronary artery', 'coronary', 'artery', 'transthoracic', 'left ventricular', 'left ventricular', 'left ventricular', 'lateral wall', 'inferior and posterior walls', 'pericardial', 'lateral wall', 'left ventricular', 'myocardial', 'Myocardial', 'myocardium', 'myocardial', 'cardiac', 'myocardial', 'lateral and inferior walls', 'left ventricular cavity', 'myocardium', 'serpiginous duct', 'duct', 'endocardium', 'endocardium to the epicardial region of the lateral wall', 'pericardial space', 'left ventricular free wall', 'myocardium', 'cardiac', 'cardiorespiratory', 'lateral wall', 'left ventricular free wall', 'infarct site']","['systemic hypertension', 'cigarette smoking', 'epigastric pain', 'ST segment depression in leads V3 to V5', 'elevated creatine kinase mass', 'non-Q AMI', 'epigastric pain', 'ST segment elevation in leads V2 to V5', 'obstruction', 'obstruction', 'obstruction', 'obstruction', 'thrombus', 'TIMI flow II.', 'infarction', 'left ventricular systolic function', 'asymptomatic', 'hemodynamic instability', 'left ventricular hypertrophy', 'depressed left ventricular systolic function', 'lateral wall akinesia', 'hypokinesia', 'pericardial effusion', 'lateral wall was thin', 'impeding left ventricular rupture', 'AMI', 'AMI perfusion', 'microbubble destruction', 'perfusion defect', 'contrast extrusion', 'serpiginous duct', 'communication', 'rupture of the left ventricular free wall', 'contrast extrusion', 'cardiogenic shock', 'cardiorespiratory arrest', 'death', 'AMI', 'left ventricular free wall rupture']","['PESDA', 'Perfluorocarbon Exposed Sonicated Dextrose and Albumin', 'albumin', 'contrast agent', 'saline']","['50', 'emergency room', '5500, Philips Medical Systems', 'Bothell, Washington']","['Physical examination', 'twelve-lead electrocardiogram', 'cardiac markers', 'creatine kinase mass', 'cardiac troponin', 'electrocardiogram', 'Coronary angiography', 'Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty', 'transthoracic echocardiogram', 'blood pressure', 'Transthoracic echocardiogram', 'two-dimensional imaging', 'myocardial contrast echocardiography', 'Myocardial contrast echocardiography', 'mechanical index', 'frame rate', 'replenishment kinetics', 'Sequences of low-power myocardial perfusion images', 'Albumin', 'mean concentration', 'mean size', 'Real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography', 'magnetic resonance', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'cardiac surgery', 'surgery', 'pericadiocentesis', 'resuscitation maneuvers', 'contrast echocardiography']","['two days earlier', 'third day post', 'post', 'post', 'third day', 'post-infarction', 'within one hour']"

Pregnancy was achieved by in vitro fertilization secondary to mother's history of endometriosis. His birth weight was 2.44 kg, (40th percentile), length was 47 cm (50th percentile), and head circumference was 34.5 cm (90th percentile). A cardiac murmur was noted soon after birth. An echocardiogram revealed severe juxtaductal aortic coarctation with near aortic arch interruption. He had a moderately dilated main pulmonary artery and branch arteries, severe septal hypertrophy, moderately depressed biventricular systolic function, biventricular hyprertrophy, and bicommissural aortic valve. He was also noted to have high arched palate, micrognathia, and low set ears with thickened helices. He had fair suck, normal muscle tone and strength. Renal ultrasound showed decreased corticomedullary differentiation, bifid right renal pelvis and moderate pelviectasis. Head ultrasound showed partial agenesis of corpus callosum (see ). He underwent surgery for juxtaductal aortic coarctation with end-to-end anastomosis and PDA ligation. At one year of age, his weight was 10.5 kg (50th percentile), length was 77.5 cm (80th percentile) and head circumference was 48.8 cm (95th percentile). He had prominent forehead, midface hypoplasia, thinned lateral eyebrows, intermittent strabismus, low set ears with thickened helices, carp-shaped mouth and retrognathia (Figure ). He started walking independently at 16 months of age. His renal ultrasound was subsequently repeated and was found to be normal. He had a brief seizure episode at 16 months of age. Since then, he has been treated with Valproic acid and the seizures have not recurred. MRI scan of the brain following the seizure episode showed diffuse delay in myelination and partial agenesis of corpus callosum. EEG showed generalized paroxysmal activity with high voltage slow waves and some short spikes.
At a chronological age of 48 months, he is in a regular classroom with children, a year younger than him. He is able to throw and catch a ball, march to a song, and use a spoon. He is not yet able to walk down stairs using alternating feet. He is able to name body parts, identify some shapes. He speaks in simple phrases, understands prepositions, and can follow simple commands. He receives speech therapy for his speech/language delays. His current level of functioning was evaluated based on teacher's assessment of his development across the domains of gross motor, fine motor, social/emotional, speech/language, and functional skills. Using the Learn and Play questionnaire, his level of functioning was broadly assessed between 23–34 month level, depending upon the specific task, reflecting mild delays in some and moderate delays in other areas. His motor skills are estimated to fall at the 25–26 month-old level, reflecting mild to moderate delays in this area. His language skills are slightly more delayed, falling at approximately the 23–24 month level, reflecting moderate delays. Cognitively, he is able to count from 1–10 in a stable sequence (a 34-month skill).
Giemsa-banded chromosome analysis was performed according to standard procedures on peripheral blood lymphocytes. Twenty metaphases were examined at the 550-band level. Further delineation of the size and boundaries of the deletion was carried out by genomic array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and FISH. For array CGH, we utilized a high-resolution chromosome 15-specific BAC array developed in our laboratory that included 106 BAC clones across 15q. The highest density of clones is across the ~10-Mb 15q11-q14 interval encompassing the common Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region including the common deletion/duplication breakpoints. Therefore a resolution of greater than 1 clone per megabase for 15q11-q14 and less than 1 clone per megabase for 15q14-qter was achieved in this version of the chromosome 15 array. Additionally the array included 38 clones specific for the subtelomeric region of 41 clinically relevant telomeres for chromosomes 1 to 22, including 12 clones for chromosomes X and 6 clones for Y chromosome. All clones were selected based on physical maps represented in build 34 (2004) of the human genome sequence []. Standard protocols for DNA preparation, labeling and hybridization were followed as described previously []. A single normal male DNA was used as reference control for analysis of the proband. All array-CGH experiments included dye reversal and two array hybridizations to obtain an accurate ratio []. After quantification and normalization of data for each clone on each of the duplicate arrays, the data from dye-reversed pairs were combined, and inferences were made according to a clone-by-clone classification procedure to determine the gain/loss status of each clone for each subject. The clone by clone classification procedure is similar to the independent clone procedure published previously []. From a number of test experiments, the overall mean across all clones for the gain state was +0.22, for the loss state -0.34, and for the no-change state -0.04 (Figure ). These values were set as approximate values for predicting a loss or gain for a clone. BAC clones chosen for FISH analysis were those that mapped within, proximal and distal to the deletion boundaries predicted by the array CGH. These included RP11-485O10 [GenBank: ] and RP11-353B9 [GenBank:] proximal to and RP11-231A23 [GenBank:] distal to the deletion interval predicted by CGH (RP11-353B9 was not included in the array but was used for narrowing down the interval by FISH only) and clones RP11-105D1 [GenBank:], RP11-23N2 [GenBank:], RP11-215J7 [GenBank:], RP11-323F24 [GenBank:] and RP11-50C13 [GenBank:] within the interval (Figures and ). Additionally, FISH with RP11-69G7 [GenBank:] encompassing α-tropomyosin gene was carried out prior to the array-CGH analysis as this was an important candidate gene for the cardiac phenotype in the proband and was located within the broader interval as estimated by G-banding and karyotype. FISH analyses were carried out as previously described []. At least ten metaphase preparations were scored for each hybridization.","[[39.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['head', 'cardiac', 'juxtaductal aortic', 'aortic arch', 'main pulmonary artery', 'branch arteries', 'septal', 'biventricular', 'biventricular', 'aortic valve', 'palate', 'ears', 'helices', 'muscle', 'Renal', 'corticomedullary', 'right renal pelvis', 'Head', 'corpus callosum', 'juxtaductal aortic', 'PDA', 'head', 'forehead', 'midface', 'lateral eyebrows', 'ears', 'helices', 'mouth', 'renal', 'brain', 'corpus callosum', 'feet', 'body parts', 'peripheral blood lymphocytes', '10-Mb 15q11-q14 interval', 'subtelomeric region', 'subtelomeric region of 41', 'chromosomes 1 to 22', 'chromosomes X', 'Y chromosome', 'cardiac']","['twin pregnancy', 'Pregnancy', 'endometriosis', 'cardiac murmur', 'juxtaductal aortic coarctation', 'aortic arch interruption', 'dilated', 'septal hypertrophy', 'depressed biventricular systolic function', 'biventricular hyprertrophy', 'bicommissural aortic valve', 'high arched palate', 'micrognathia', 'low set ears', 'thickened helices', 'fair suck', 'normal muscle tone and strength', 'corticomedullary differentiation', 'bifid right renal pelvis', 'pelviectasis', 'agenesis of corpus callosum', 'juxtaductal aortic coarctation', 'prominent forehead', 'midface hypoplasia', 'thinned lateral eyebrows', 'strabismus', 'low set ears', 'thickened helices', 'carp-shaped mouth', 'retrognathia', 'walking independently', 'seizure', 'seizure episode', 'seizures', 'seizure episode', 'delay in myelination', 'agenesis of corpus callosum', 'generalized paroxysmal activity', 'high voltage slow waves', 'short spikes', 'able to throw and catch a ball', 'march to a song', 'use a spoon', 'not yet able to walk down stairs using alternating feet', 'able to name body parts', 'name body parts', 'identify some shapes', 'speaks in simple phrases', 'understands prepositions', 'can follow simple commands', 'speech/language delays', 'gross motor', 'fine motor', 'social/emotional', 'speech/language', 'functional skills', 'delays', 'delays', 'motor skills are estimated to fall', 'delays', 'language skills are slightly more delayed', 'delays', 'able to count from 1–10 in a stable sequence', 'BAC clones across 15q', 'highest density of clones', 'Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region', 'common deletion/duplication breakpoints', 'deletion/duplication breakpoints', 'resolution of greater than 1 clone per megabase', 'resolution of greater than 1 clone per megabase for 15q11-q14 and less than 1 clone per megabase for 15q14-qter was achieved in this version of the chromosome 15 array', 'array included 38 clones specific for the subtelomeric region of 41 clinically relevant telomeres for chromosomes 1', 'BAC clones', 'deletion boundaries', 'clones', 'cardiac phenotype in the proband']",['Valproic acid'],"['36', '39-year', '48', '2004']","['vitro fertilization', 'birth weight', 'length', 'head circumference', 'echocardiogram', 'Renal ultrasound', 'Head ultrasound', 'surgery for juxtaductal aortic coarctation', 'end-to-end anastomosis', 'PDA ligation', 'weight', 'length', 'head circumference', 'renal ultrasound', 'MRI scan of the brain', 'EEG', 'speech therapy', 'level of functioning', 'Giemsa-banded chromosome analysis', 'peripheral blood lymphocytes', 'Twenty metaphases', 'genomic array-based', 'CGH', 'FISH', 'array CGH', 'high-resolution chromosome 15-specific BAC array', 'laboratory', 'DNA preparation', 'labeling', 'hybridization', 'proband', 'array-CGH', 'CGH', 'FISH', 'FISH analysis', 'array CGH', 'CGH', 'FISH', 'FISH', 'FISH with RP11-69G7', 'array-CGH analysis', 'G-banding', 'karyotype', 'FISH']",['36-week']

She had no prior history of head and neck radiation and no family history of thyroid or parathyroid disease. The patient had noted little change in lesion size but persistent pain, aggravated by talking, which was troublesome for her. She did not have any complaints of voice change. She had initially been investigated 5 years earlier with complaints of pain radiating over the left side of her face. At that time a small firm nodule in the left thyroid lobe was discovered and a needle biopsy found no evidence of malignancy. At that time it was diagnosed as a benign nodular goiter and observation was recommended.
An ultrasound identified a left lower thyroid lobe mass measuring 2.7 × 1.6 × 2.7 cm with cystic and solid components. Her serum ionized calcium level was normal and her intact PTH was elevated to three times the upper limit of normal. Due to ongoing facial pain a left thyroid lobectomy and isthmusectomy was carried out. Intraoperatively, a firm multinodular left thyroid lobe was appreciated. There were no abnormal central compartment lymph nodes identified or removed at surgery.
Pathological examination of the specimen revealed a large, yellowish tumor measuring 2.7 × 2.0 × 2.0 cm that was pushing into the left thyroid lobe, but separated from it by a fibrous capsule (Figure ). The mass was noted to be composed of monomorphous parathyroid cells without significant necrosis or mitotic activity. There was invasion into the thyroid capsule and into adjacent fatty tissue. No vascular invasion was noted (Figure ). A cystic goiter was also noted in the left thyroid lobe. Further immunohistochemical studies found the tumour did not express: Thyroid Transcription Factor – 1, Calcitonin, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), but did express Chromagranin, Synaptophysin, Bcl -2 and Cytokeratin 7.

Two weeks before admission she had right sided pleural pain followed by dyspnoea, without cough and without fever, these increased with time and therefore she referred herself to the hospital. Her physical examination suggested right sided pleural effusion, laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (WBC-19000/mm3 with 89% neutrophils), HGB-12.5 g/dL, platelet count 400,000 platelets/mm3, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 34 mm/hour. C-reactive protein level was highly elevated – 45 mg/dL (normal range 0–0.5 mg/dL). The results of chemistry panel were normal except for mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase – 157 u/l (40–130 u/l).
A chest CT performed on admission (figure ) showed massive right pleural effusion, with right lung athelectasis. Chest tube was inserted to the pleural cavity and evacuated only small amount of purulent fluid, although streptokinase was injected to the pleural cavity four times. Antibiotic treatment was started using IV Cefuroxime (750 mg three times a day) and oral Roxithromycin (150 mg twice a day) for 4 days without signs of improvement.
A repeated CT performed 4 days after admission, showed a massive amount of right sided pleural effusion with right middle and lower lobe athelectasis. Therefore, a right sided thoracotomy was performed. A significant amount of pus and fibrin was drained during the procedure, and the lung expanded normally after the pleura was decorticated on that side. Pus from the empyema (before and after starting antibiotic treatment) was cultured several times both for common pathogens as well as Mycobacteria but turned to be negative. Pathological examination of the pleura that was removed during the procedure showed fibrotic pleura covered by pus and fibrin without evidence for any organism. Given the clinical gradual and atypical course of the patient with the negative stains and cultures results, the pleural pus and fluid were also tested for M.pneumoniae using PCR. DNA was extracted from the pus using the DNAeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). First we have utilised a Mycoplasma genus specific PCR amplifying 16SRNA DNA, doing direct amplification using the same thermal profile and GPO-3/MGSO primers as described in ref []. In this test one negative and one positive controls were used for 10 samples. Surprisingly a positive typical band at the size of ~270 bp was found, suggesting the presence of Mycoplasma spp. in the sample. Therefore, we further used two sets of M.pneumoniae specie specific PCR reactions to identify if it is M.pneumoniae. The first was a nested PCR using the primers of the ATPase gene in the same conditions as described in ref []. This test was shown in our lab to have a detection limit of ~20 CFU/ml (Nir-Paz et al. data on file). Two negative controls were included for every 8 samples tested in order to exclude contaminations during the nested reaction as well as a positive control for 16 reactions. This test gave a typical band at the size of 104 bp suggesting that the existence of M.pneumoniae. In order to confirm that finding, we have performed another M.pneumoniae specific PCR using the P1 gene. A direct PCR using the same primers and conditions as described in Ref [] was performed. In this test one negative and one positive controls were used for 10 samples. Again this PCR gave a typical positive band at the size of 466 bp, confirming the presence of M.pneumoniae DNA in the sample. Unfortunately, only convalescent serum that was taken 30 days after the initial admission was available for serology, and it was indeterminate with a titer of 1:80 using the Serodia-Myco II assay (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan), and IgM negative using Mycoplasma pneumoniaea IgM EIA (ANILabsystems, Helsinki, Finland).
After the surgery, the patient was gradually recovered with intravenous azythromycin treatment (500 mg once a day) for 10 days followed by 5 more days of oral therapy (250 mg once a day), In addition she was treated with oral Pyranocarboxylate (400 mg twice a day) for the first two weeks after surgery.
The CRP level dropped to 9.5 mg/dl after the operation and two weeks later, the CRP level decreased into normal levels (0.2 mg/dl). At this time point the patient fully recovered without any breath or pain complaints and no residual fluid was seen in the chest X -ray.","[[57.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['right sided pleural', 'right sided pleural', 'chest', 'right pleural', 'right lung', 'Chest', 'pleural cavity', 'pleural cavity', 'right sided pleural', 'right middle and lower lobe', 'lung', 'pleura', 'pleura', 'pleural', 'pus', 'chest']","['dyspnoea', 'right sided pleural pain', 'dyspnoea', 'cough', 'fever', 'right sided pleural effusion', 'leukocytosis', 'right pleural effusion', 'right lung athelectasis', 'purulent fluid', 'improvement', 'right sided pleural effusion', 'right middle and lower lobe athelectasis', 'pus', 'fibrin', 'lung expanded normally', 'Pus', 'empyema', 'common pathogens', 'Mycobacteria', 'fibrotic pleura', 'pus', 'fibrin', 'organism', 'pleural pus', 'fluid', 'M.pneumoniae', 'Mycoplasma spp', 'M.pneumoniae', 'typical band', 'M.pneumoniae', 'M.pneumoniae DNA', 'fully recovered', 'breath or pain complaints', 'residual fluid']","['streptokinase', 'Cefuroxime', 'Roxithromycin', 'azythromycin', 'Pyranocarboxylate']","['57', 'Hilden', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'Helsinki']","['physical examination', 'laboratory tests', 'WBC', 'neutrophils', 'HGB', 'platelet count', 'erythrocyte sedimentation rate', 'C-reactive protein level', 'chemistry panel', 'alkaline phosphatase', 'chest CT', 'Chest tube was inserted to the pleural cavity and evacuated only small amount of purulent fluid', 'Antibiotic treatment', 'CT', 'right sided thoracotomy', 'significant amount of pus and fibrin was drained', 'pleura was decorticated', 'antibiotic treatment', 'cultured', 'Pathological examination of the pleura', 'procedure', 'stains', 'cultures', 'tested for M.pneumoniae', 'PCR', 'DNA was extracted from the pus using the DNAeasy tissue kit', 'DNA was extracted from the pus using the DNAeasy tissue kit', 'Mycoplasma genus specific PCR amplifying 16SRNA DNA', 'direct amplification using the same thermal profile and GPO-3/MGSO primers', 'bp', 'M.pneumoniae specie specific PCR reactions', 'nested PCR using the primers of the ATPase gene', 'lab', 'nested reaction', 'test', 'M.pneumoniae specific PCR', 'direct PCR', 'PCR', 'band', 'convalescent serum', 'serology', 'titer', 'Serodia-Myco II assay', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniaea IgM EIA', 'surgery', 'oral therapy', 'surgery', 'CRP level', 'operation', 'CRP level', 'chest X -ray']","['Two weeks before admission', '4 days', '30 days', 'At this time', 'At this time']"
331,1397849-1,16504168,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1397849.xml,Trunk and hip muscle recruitment patterns during the prone leg extension following a lateral ankle sprain: A prospective case study pre and post injury,"This case study is a product of serendipity. A 27 year old female runner was initially part of an experimental study documenting the muscle onset timing of the posterior leg and trunk muscles during the prone leg extension. At the time of the study the participant had no leg or spine injuries. The participant was part of the asymptomatic control group. Five months after the completion of the study this participant suffered an inversion right ankle sprain during a rainstorm while leaping into a camping tent filled with children. At 2 and 8 weeks post ankle sprain the PLE extension test was performed while recording the posterior muscle activation EMG to determine if an ankle injury influences the timing of muscle activation during the PLE as compared with an injury-free PLE onset timing pattern.
Twenty seven year old female distance runner (height – 167 cm, weight -58 kg) suffered a right ankle inversion sprain. X rays revealed no fractures. Informed consent to participate in this study was received from the subject. In the initial study the participant read and signed an information and consent form that was approved by the Research Ethics Board of CMCC. For the second half of the study the subject was notified of the risks and benefits of the study which complied with the World Medical Association declaration of Helsinki on the ethical conduct of research using human participants within a private practice and agreed to have her results published.
No passive therapy was received by the participant. The participant was encouraged to perform daily weight bearing exercise and range of motion exercises. The participant was running within two weeks of the injury with pain and not at her pre injury level. At two weeks post injury the participant reported that she felt she was functioning at 60% of her optimum. At 8 weeks post injury the participant reported that she was running 95% pain free with little loss of function.
An identical testing protocol was used across the 3 experimental days (pre injury, 2 weeks post injury and 8 weeks post injury). The muscle activity of the right gluteus maximus, bilateral lower erector spinae, and right hamstring muscle groups was recorded during right prone leg extension while lying prone on a manual therapy table. The position of the leg was controlled in all planes (no hip adduction/abduction or internal/external rotation) visually by the experimenter. A rig restricting movement or a kinematic analysis system to ensure an identical movement across trials was not used as this is not similar to what occurs during practice. The control of proper form was limited to a visual assessment as this most resembles clinical practice.
Disposable bipolar Ag-AgCl disc surface electrodes with a diameter of one cm were adhered bilaterally over the five muscle groups with a centre to centre spacing of 1 cm. Raw EMG was amplified 5000 times. The amplifier has a CMRR of 10,000:1 (Bortec EMG, Calgary AB, Canada). Raw EMG was band pass filtered (10 and 1000 Hz) and A/D converted at 2000 Hz using a National Instruments data acquisition system.
The prone leg extension exercise was performed five times during each experimental session. The task required the subject to lie prone at complete rest with no movement while the EMG from each muscle was collected for 5 seconds. The subject then extended their straight right leg approximately six inches off the table. The leg was held isometrically for 3 seconds then lowered to the table.
The data from each PLE trial was processed in the same manner. The aim of the processing for this study was to determine the order and timing of muscle activation. To determine muscle timing, it is necessary to determine when a muscle is considered active or ""on"". A muscle was considered ""on"" when the level of muscle activity was greater than 10% of the peak muscle activity during the prone leg extension. This method of determining muscle onset was used in the previous study by Bullock-Saxton et al []. The order of activation can then be determined by classifying each muscle as ""on"" when its level of activity exceeds that of its predetermined threshold. Muscle activation time (milliseconds-ms) was referenced to the time of activation of the hamstring muscle. For example, positive values (ms) occurred when a muscle's onset occurred before activation of the hamstring muscle group, and negative values indicated that muscle activation occurred after the onset of the hamstring muscle. The onset of muscle activity was determined for each muscle during each repetition of the prone leg lift. Please note that the EMG activity was not normalized to a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). While MVCs are important in the collection of EMG when there is a need for determining muscle amplitude, this was not necessary in the current study because muscle timing rather than amplitude was measured. Normalization would not influence the muscle onset results.
The data was processed in the following manner: The raw EMG signal was first full wave rectified, then smoothed using a moving average technique which averaged every 100 points of data with an overlap 98 points. The bias was removed from the signal to allow resting activity to be at 0. The peak muscle activity was found and each data point was divided by this peak muscle activity. In this way, muscle onset could be determined by determining the time when the myoelectric signal exceeded 10% of the maximum. The signal was visually inspected to ensure that no artefact occurred or that the results were biologically feasible.","[[27.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['muscle', 'posterior leg', 'trunk muscles', 'leg', 'spine', 'right ankle', 'ankle', 'PLE', 'ankle', 'muscle', 'PLE', 'right ankle', 'muscle', 'right gluteus maximus', 'bilateral lower erector spinae', 'right hamstring muscle groups', 'right prone leg', 'leg', 'hip', 'disc surface', 'five muscle groups', 'leg', 'muscle', 'right leg', 'leg', 'PLE', 'muscle', 'muscle', 'muscle', 'muscle', 'muscle', 'muscle', 'leg', 'muscle', 'muscle', 'Muscle', 'hamstring', 'hamstring muscle', 'muscle', 'hamstring muscle group', 'muscle', 'hamstring muscle', 'muscle', 'leg', 'muscle', 'muscle', 'muscle', 'muscle', 'muscle', 'muscle']","['injuries', 'inversion right ankle sprain', 'ankle sprain', 'ankle injury', 'injury-free PLE onset timing pattern', 'right ankle inversion sprain', 'fractures', 'injury', 'pain', 'injury', 'injury', 'functioning at 60% of her optimum', 'injury', 'pain free', 'loss of function', 'injury', 'injury', 'injury', 'muscle activity', 'position of the leg was controlled in all planes', 'hip adduction/abduction', 'internal/external rotation', 'muscle activation', 'onset of the hamstring muscle', 'onset of muscle activity', 'MVC', 'MVCs', 'artefact']",[],"['27', 'Research Ethics Board of CMCC', 'Canada']","['asymptomatic control group', 'study', 'PLE extension test', 'posterior muscle activation EMG', 'height', 'weight', 'X rays', 'passive therapy', 'weight bearing exercise', 'range of motion exercises', 'right prone leg extension', 'Disposable bipolar Ag-AgCl disc surface electrodes with a diameter of one cm were adhered bilaterally over the five muscle groups with a centre to centre spacing of 1 cm.', 'Raw EMG', 'EMG', 'study', 'EMG activity', 'EMG', 'raw EMG signal', 'bias']","['2 and 8 weeks', 'post', 'two weeks', 'two weeks', 'two weeks', 'two weeks', 'post', '8 weeks', 'post', 'pre', '2 weeks', 'post', '8 weeks', 'post']"

On the day of surgery he was administered one gram of intravenous cefazolin which served as routine perioperative prophylaxis. Anesthesia was achieved with inhaled desflurane, along with fentanyl, propofol, and midazolam. Cisatracurium was employed for neuromuscular blockade. Post operatively, he received morphine sulfate, ketorolac, and ondansetron. His recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged home three days after his surgery with prescriptions for docusate sodium, acetaminophen, and hydrocodone. Upon discharge his serum creatinine was 1.8 mg/dL, WBC 10.0 per 109/L, platelet count 197 per 109/L, hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL. Eosinophils constituted 0.2% of WBC population.
Post operative day ten was marked by the emergence of fevers as high as 38.4 C, generalized weakness, and arthralgias involving bilateral knees, wrists, ankles, and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. Simultaneously, a cutaneous eruption appeared which was initially limited to bilateral upper extremities but soon involved his trunk, back, face and lower extremities. Furthermore, additional MCP joints become swollen and tender in sequential order from medial to lateral. Upon questioning, he denied the presence of any gastrointestinal disturbance such as nausea, emesis, or diarrhea. On physical examination he was found to be afebrile. He appeared uncomfortable but was in no apparent distress. Oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and cardiac examinations were unremarkable. Although there was mild peri-incisional tenderness, his abdomen was soft and his surgical wounds appeared to be healing well with no evidence of local infection. There was no lymphadenopathy. Diffuse urticaria involving all extremities, trunk, back, neck, and face were noted. Nearly all his MCP joints were warm, swollen, and tender to touch. Of note, there appeared to be a sequential pattern of early MCP joint resolution as the medial joints that had been initially affected most, now appeared to be improving somewhat while the lateral ones were now most affected. In addition, the knees, ankles, wrists, and left metatarsophalangeal joint were also affected, although no effusions were appreciated upon physical examination. Repeat laboratory analysis was performed which revealed serum creatinine was 1.6 mg/dL, WBC 9.7 per 109/L, platelet count 353 per 109/L, hemoglobin 13.8 g/dL. Eosinophils constituted 2.6% of WBC population. Serum complement levels, immunoglobulin concentrations, and erythrocyte sedimentations rate were not obtained at this time. Urinalysis revealed trace albuminuria, with no hematuria or glycosuria. Microscopic examination of the urine revealed rare hyaline casts and the distinct absence of red or white cells and cellular casts.
Based on the aforementioned clinical findings, the absence of systemic vasculitis, and a history of a cephalosporin antibiotic exposure approximately two weeks earlier, a diagnosis of a SSLR was made. For five days, he was treated with prednisone 20 mg twice daily, loratadine 10 mg daily as well as famotidine 20 mg twice daily for H2 receptor blockade. Within 48 hours he noted near resolution of the urticaria as well as a significant improvement in the inflamed joints. He was reevaluated two weeks after this treatment and was found to have no further evidence of fevers, rash, or joint involvement.

A case report,"A 57 year-old woman had a traffic accident with traumatic brain death and was selected for organ donation. The woman was older than the upper age limit of 55 for heart donation.
Next, a careful cardiac history took form, with no background data of cardiac symptoms at rest or under effort. There was a history of mild systemic hypertension. A 12 -lead electrocardiogram resulted in non-specific T wave changes, often seen in brain death.
At time when doses of intravenous inotropic agents have been lowered to as low as is compatible with adequate blood pressure and cardiac output (noradrenaline 0.13 γ/Kg/min + dobutamine 2.8 γ/Kg/min) and after adequate fluid infusion a TT echocardiogram was taken demonstrating normal global and segmental ventricular function, no valvular disease [].
To rule out moderate or severe heart and coronary disease, a TE Dipyridamole stress echo (6 minutes accelerated protocol) was performed [].
The echo images were tape-recorded and periodically digitized. During the procedure, pressure and ECG were recorded every minute []. Results of the transesophageal dipyridamole stress echo are shown in Additional Files (video clips) , ,, and . There was a normal response of the left ventricle during stress. Brachial blood pressure was measured with cuff sphygmomanometer. In every phase of the stress echo, the projections of the 4 chambers and of the apical 2 chambers were recorded to calculate the left ventricular telesystolic volume. This allowed us to calculate the systolic pressure/left ventricle telesystolic volume ratio in every moment when increasing the cardiac frequency during the stress and building, off-line, the force-frequency relation (FFR) of the left ventricle [].
Wall motion was normal at baseline and at peak stress (WMSI = 1 at baseline and peak stress), without signs of stress inducible ischemia (Additional files , , , and ).
The pressure/volume relation was 9.6 mmHg/ml/m2 at baseline, increasing to 14 mmHg/ml/m2 at peak stress, FFR slope = 28 mmHg/ml/m2 /bpm demonstrating absence of latent myocardial dysfunction (Figure ).
Systemic blood pressure decreased from 120/60 mmHg at baseline to 100/45 mmHg at peak stress.
LVEF % increased from 63% at baseline to 77% at peak stress.
Based on the dipyridamole stress results, despite the age beyond the 55 years limit, the heart was chosen for orthotopic heart transplantation, and was explanted with standard technique.
The recipient was ""marginal"" for co-morbidity. He was a 63 year old man with multiple myeloma and cardiac amyloidosis, chronic severe heart failure, NYHA class IV, LVEF = 13% (TT echocardiography, Figure ) [].
The operation was performed by way of a median sternotomy incision, with cannulation of the aorta and both venae cavae. The implantation procedure required one hour. The incision was closed after placement of temporary pacing wires and chest drainage catheters [].
After the transplant, the patient underwent a routine treatment and follow-up procedure.
Standard postoperative treatment was performed, mobilization and physical therapy was begun the day 7 after surgery.
Early immunosuppressant regimen was started according to the standard protocols.
The transplanted heart was assessed normal for dimensions and ventricular function at TT echocardiography on post-transplant day 7 (Additional files and ).

These symptoms resolved spontaneously after a day or two. The patient denied fever, night sweats, weight loss, dysphasia, skin rashes, hemetemesis or altered bowel habits. Physical examination revealed a soft, nontender abdomen and no palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy. The patient had been treated with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-Cda) therapy for the past four years.
The patient's white blood cell count remained within the reference range for the past 4 years, ranging from 4.8–6.5 × 103/μl (reference range: 3.5 – 10.0 × 103 μl). Lymphocytes ranged from 47–53% (reference range: 15–52%). No atypical lymphoid cells were noted in the peripheral smears.
A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis demonstrated multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes as well as bulky retroperitoneal and gastro-hepatic lymphadenopathy suggestive of lymphoma.
After informed consent, EUS was performed which demonstrated multiple enlarged lymph nodes around the gastro-hepatic region, the largest of which measured 14 × 8 mm. The lymph node appeared hypoechoic with round borders.
Air-dried smears from samples obtained by EUS-FNA were stained with Romanowsky stain (Diff Quik) in the endoscopy suite to determine whether the target lesion was indeed aspirated as has been described previously []. Aspirates revealed small to intermediate sized mononuclear cells with moderate cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei with smooth nuclear borders, a stippled chromatin pattern and occasional single nucleoli. The cytoplasm was pale grey and granular with hair-like and short, blunt, cytoplasmic projections (cytoplasmic blebs) (figures , ). Occasional groups of glandular cells with a honey-comb appearance, preserved nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, regular nuclear membrane and lack of marked pleomorphism and mitoses helped distinguish them from the gastrointestinal tract mucosa as benign epithelial cell groups. Additional samples were collected in RPMI medium for flow cytometry examination to perform immunophenotyping and to determine clonality. Additional samples were collected in Hank's balanced salt solution for paraffin embedded cell block preparation. Several smears prepared in the endoscopy suite were fixed in 95% alcohol and were later stained with Papanicolaou stain.
The EUS-FNA sample was analyzed by 4 color flow cytometry (Facscan, BD® Instrument, Becton Dickinson Inc., San Jose, CA). A total of 2.2 million mononuclear cells with viability of 89% are obtained. These cells are stained by panel of various fluorochrome conjugated antibodies (mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies, dilutions ranging from 1:2 to 1:10, Caltag® Laboratories, Burlingame, CA.,). After standard washing steps and fixation these are analyzed on BD® instrument. Selective gating on lymphoid population (large cell gate) was positive for clonal B-cells (>98%) expressing CD19, CD20, CD11c bright, CD25 bright, CD103 and were lambda light chain restricted. CD10, CD5 and CD3 were negative (figure ). This immuno-phenotype along with observed morphology on the flow Wright stained cytospin smear was also diagnostic of HCL.

Case report and review of the literature,"A 20-years-old Caucasian male, presented to a district hospital with acute right lower quadrant pain from six hours before. Physical examination revealed abdominal pain, localized right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, body temperature slightly elevated (37.7°C), blood pressure 120/90 mmHg and heart rate 110/min. Blood tests showed leukocyte count at 12600/μL, the differential white account showing 75% neutrophils and hematocrit 35.9%. Abdominal and chest radiographs were normal. The primary diagnosis was acute appendicitis and appendectomy was decided. Entering the peritoneal cavity from a McBurney incision, the surgeon found large amount of blood and the surgery was transformed to exploratory laparotomy through a midline incision. The findings were enormous hepatomegaly and bleeding due to spontaneous rupture of the IV lobe of the liver. Active bleeding was managed with direct suture of identifiable vessels and absorbable gauze mesh. Postoperative course was uneventful, except of a continuous elevated body temperature (up to 38.5°C). The patient, five days after surgery, was referred to us in order to undergo further examinations for the nature of the liver abnormality. His medical history was unremarkable. He was previously in good health. His family and past history were not contributory. The patient weighted 65 Kg with 1.75 m height. He was in his right senses and well nourished. Yellow skin, icteric sclera, spider naevi and palmar erythema were not founded. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable. Chest radiograph revealed no pulmonary pathology. The abdomen was swollen with the liver palpable. Laboratory tests showed liver function tests normal (before the initial surgery however, after the surgery SGOT, SGPT, LDH were altered three times the normal range) hepatitis markers of HAV, HBV, HCV, and HIV were negative and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was 35 ng/ml. The patient underwent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen that showed hepatomegaly and a large hypodense lesion of the liver with multicystic appearance with septations and solid portions (Figure ). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in T2-weighted and Short Time Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequences revealing hyperdense areas with intermixed hypodense septa (Figure ), and a thrombus in the inferior vena cava (Figure ). The differential diagnosis by the CT and MRI findings was giant hemangioma or cystic malignant lesion. Due to the size of the lesion and the previous history of spontaneous bleeding, it was decided that the patient must undergo surgery. In order to prevent pulmonary embolism, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted and fixated just below the renal veins. Two days later the patient underwent surgery. Primarily, thrombectomy and reconstruction of the inferior vena cava with removal of the filter was performed, followed by hepatectomy of I–IV and VIII lobe of the liver. Intraoperative biopsy demonstrated malignancy or sarcoma of the liver. Frozen section on the remaining liver was performed and showed normal liver tissue. The patient after surgery presented with life threatening bleeding and protean coagulation abnormalities, symptoms of disseminated intravascular coagulation, due to massive blood transfusion. The patient died the second postoperative day due to uncontrolled bleeding caused of the developing of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Pathologic review of the specimen revealed a 1580 gm left and part of right hepatic lobe, with a 30 × 14 × 9 cm tumor mass and the histological examination showed malignant sarcomatous tissue with spares giant neoplastic cells (head arrow) and residual hepatocytes (arrow) suggestive of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma (Figure ). Sarcomatous tissue with severe atypia of the neoplastic cells and focal presence of giant cells partially with myoblastic characteristics was also present (Figure ).

The rest of the examination was normal. There had been no previous scrotal surgery or trauma.
Tumour markers including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) were normal. His total white cell count was normal. An ultrasound of the scrotum demonstrated a localised tumour of the testis. Chest x-ray was normal. A standard left radical orchidectomy was performed by the inguinal approach. The tumour appeared to be confined to the upper pole of the testis and was clinically described as T1 or T2. Macroscopic histological examination suggested no involvement of the tunica albuginea, epididymis or spermatic cord. Microscopic examination demonstrated infiltration of the testis by uniform ovoid cells with clear cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli consistent with seminoma (Fig ). Tumour involved the tunica albuginea but did not extend through it. There was no vascular invasion. Surprisingly, seminoma cells were present beneath the epithelial lining of the vas deferans extending to the spermatic cord resection margin but nowhere else within the spermatic cord. (Fig ). The microscopic slides gave the appearance of sub epithelial spread of seminoma cells along the vas deferans. Other structures in the spermatic cord were not involved.
A post operative CT scan demonstrated two separate masses. A 2.8 cm by 2.3 cm central abdominal mesenteric mass and a 7.6 cm by 5.4 cm irregular heterogeneous lobulated soft tissue mass within the pelvis arising from the prostate and extending into the mesorectal fascia. There were no enlarged retroperitoneal, pelvic, inguinal or thoracic lymph nodes. (Fig and ). The chest CT scan was normal. The patient has received chemotherapy and is currently under follow up according to standard EUA guidelines. There is no evidence of residual or recurrent disease.

Ultrasound evaluation of the posterior segment revealed findings consistent with an organized vitreous hemorrhage and incomplete posterior vitreous detachment. Transconjuctival sutureless pars plana vitrectomy was planned using the Bausch and Lomb 25G vitrectomy system. Per-operatively, sleeve for the infusion line was first placed in the inferotemporal quadrant transconjunctivally using the 25 G trocar. After inserting the infusion line through the above sleeve, two more sleeves for the endo illuminator and vitreous cutter were made using the 25G trocar transconjunctivally. Vitrectomy was started using high cut rates (1500 cuts/min) and suction of 500 mm Hg. A fibrovascular frond was noted attached to the disc, which had to be diathermised. To accommodate a conventional unimanual bipolar diathermy probe a localized peritomy was made and the superonasal sclerotomy was enlarged using a 20 G MVR blade. The frond was diathermised, endolaser pan retinal photocoagulation was completed and the conventional sclerotomy was closed using 6-0 vicryl mattress suture placed at a depth of about 75% of the scleral lip. Vitreous was well cleared from this wound opening using the vitrectomy probe around the edges of the sclerotomy before closure. The sleeves of the remaining two 25 G sclerotomies were removed and the overlying conjunctiva was slightly massaged in that area. No wound leak was noted at the end of the procedure. Postoperatively intraocular pressure of 10 mm Hg was recorded.
Ultrasound biomicroscopy (Paradigm model P40) of the sclerotomy sites was done on day 2 postoperatively and again repeated on day 7 and day 14. The port sites were identified at the 20G site by the color of the vicryl suture and at the 25G site by the distortion of the overlying conjunctival vasculature. On day 2, we observed a wide gape at the site that had been enlarged to accommodate the diathermy probe using a 20G MVR blade. In contrast to this, the other two sites wherein sleeves were placed transconjunctivally using the 25G trocar showed only a mild gape (figure ). While significant gape continued to persist at the subsequent evaluations on day 7 and day 14 only at the port that had been enlarged, the other two ports showed only a minimal gape of the internal lip (figure 2). In addition, we also observed some vitreous incarceration at one of the 25 G sclerotomy sites.","[[25.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['vitreous', 'left eye', 'posterior segment', 'vitreous', 'posterior vitreous', 'Transconjuctival sutureless pars plana', 'inferotemporal quadrant transconjunctivally', 'fibrovascular', 'disc', 'frond', 'retinal', 'scleral lip', 'Vitreous', 'conjunctiva', 'sclerotomy sites', 'port sites', '20G site', 'vicryl suture', '25G site', 'conjunctival vasculature', 'site', 'two sites', 'transconjunctivally', 'internal lip', 'vitreous', 'one of the 25 G sclerotomy sites']","[""Eales' disease"", 'vitreous hemorrhage', 'vitreous hemorrhage', 'posterior vitreous detachment', 'fibrovascular frond', 'wound leak', 'distortion of the overlying conjunctival vasculature', 'wide gape', 'gape', 'gape', 'port that had been enlarged', 'enlarged', 'gape of the internal lip', 'vitreous incarceration']",[],['25'],"['Ultrasound evaluation of the posterior segment', 'Transconjuctival sutureless pars plana vitrectomy', 'sleeve for the infusion line was first placed in the inferotemporal quadrant transconjunctivally using the 25 G trocar', 'inserting the infusion line through the above sleeve', 'two more sleeves for the endo illuminator and vitreous cutter were made using the 25G trocar transconjunctivally', 'Vitrectomy was started using high cut rates (1500 cuts/min) and suction of 500 mm Hg.', 'fibrovascular frond was noted attached to the disc, which had to be diathermised', 'diathermised', 'conventional unimanual bipolar diathermy probe a localized peritomy was made', 'superonasal sclerotomy was enlarged using a 20 G MVR blade', 'frond was diathermised', 'endolaser pan retinal photocoagulation', 'conventional sclerotomy was closed using 6-0 vicryl mattress suture placed at a depth of about 75% of the scleral lip', 'Vitreous was well cleared from this wound opening using the vitrectomy probe around the edges of the sclerotomy before closure', 'sleeves of the remaining two 25 G sclerotomies were removed', 'conjunctiva was slightly massaged in that area', 'intraocular pressure', 'Ultrasound biomicroscopy', 'wide gape at the site that had been enlarged to accommodate the diathermy probe using a 20G MVR blade', 'sleeves were placed transconjunctivally', 'sleeves were placed transconjunctivally using the 25G trocar']","['2 months', 'Postoperatively', 'postoperatively', 'On day 2', 'day 7', 'day 14']"

The patient had been living in Italy for 14 years, when he went back home to Sri-Lanka. He was there for 2 months, before returning to Italy where, few days later, he began suffering from fever, malaise, headache and non productive cough. He turned up at the emergency department of our hospital after 10 days from the beginning of symptoms.
On the basis of anamnestic data no history of drinking, smoking and illicit drug abuse was reported. Moreover, in his medical history there was no evidence of serious illness, such as diabetes mellitus or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The patient had not been using proton pump inhibitors of stomach acid tablets, neither oral glycocorticosteroids or inhalation corticosteroids. Moreover, he did not need to take any antibiotics during his stay in Sri-Lanka.
The patient had a blood pressure of 180/100 mm Hg, a heart rate of 120 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, and a temperature of 38.9°C. On chest examination bilateral scattered rhonchi and mild rales were audible at the base of both the man's lungs. A chest radiograph revealed accentuation of the pulmonary reticulum, more marked on the right, but no clear signs of consolidation. The rest of the examination was notable for a minimally distended abdomen which was diffusely tender. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cells (WBC) count of 6,400 cells/mm3 (normal range 4,000–10,000 cells/ mm3), a haemoglobin level of 15 g/dl (12–17 g/dl), a platelet count of 189,000 cells/mm3 (150,000 – 450,000 cells/mm3), an aspartate amino-transferase level of 71 U/L, an alanine aminotransferase level of 98 U/L; blood glucose level, serum electrolyte concentrations and renal function tests were within normal limits. A presumptive diagnosis of bronchitis was made, and the patient was transferred to our infectious disease department.
At the time of admission, the patient was persistently febrile (39°C). On physical examination we noted dry skin and oral candidiasis characterized by creamy white, curdlike patches on the tongue; this clinical picture was so typical that it did not need a culture to confirm the diagnosis of oral candidiasis. His abdomen was diffusely tender to palpation and without recognizable hepatosplenomegaly. Cultures of blood and respiratory specimens were performed. Thick and thin blood smears for malaria were obtained.
Treatment with topical nystatin and empirical therapy with ciprofloxacin (500 mg iv every 12 hours) were started. Because of the oro pharyngeal candidiasis, lymphocyte count was taken, the absolute number of lymphocytes was 562 cells/ mm3. The CD4+ cell count was 130 cells/mm3while the CD8+ was 240; as a second step an HIV test (ELISA) was performed and was negative. To rule out a very recent infection a qualitative HIV PCR was performed and HIV RNA was undetectable. On the 3rd day of hospitalisation, a Salmonella species identified as S. typhi was isolated from the two consecutive blood cultures obtained on the day of admission. Isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, chloramphenicol, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin with the standard disk diffusion susceptibility testing method. The patient continued ciprofloxacin for a total of 10 days; he became afebrile after 3 days of therapy and his oral candidiasis improved slowly with nistatin. The patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital on the 10th day. At that time, his CD4+ cell count was 622 cells/mm3.
On the 20th day after discharge and in the 3rd month of follow-up, the patient was symptom free and his CD4+ cell count was raised to 1,080 and 1,200 cells/mm3 respectively.","[[57.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['stomach', 'heart', 'chest', ""base of both the man's lungs"", 'chest', 'pulmonary reticulum', 'abdomen', 'renal', 'skin', 'oral', 'tongue', 'oral', 'abdomen', 'respiratory', 'oro pharyngeal', 'pharyngeal', 'oral']","['fever', 'malaise', 'headache', 'cough', 'symptoms', 'drinking', 'illicit drug abuse', 'diabetes mellitus', 'human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection', 'rhonchi', 'rales', 'accentuation of the pulmonary reticulum', 'consolidation', 'distended abdomen', 'tender', 'bronchitis', 'febrile', 'dry skin', 'oral candidiasis', 'oral candidiasis', 'tender to palpation', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'malaria', 'oro pharyngeal candidiasis', 'pharyngeal candidiasis', 'infection', 'Salmonella species', 'S. typhi', 'afebrile', 'oral candidiasis', 'symptom']","['nystatin', 'ciprofloxacin', 'ampicillin', 'cotrimoxazole', 'chloramphenicol', 'cefotaxime', 'ceftriaxone', 'ciprofloxacin', 'ciprofloxacin', 'nistatin']","['November 2004', '57', 'emergency department', 'Italy', 'Sri-Lanka', 'Italy', 'emergency department', 'Sri-Lanka', '10th', '20th']","['proton pump inhibitors', 'proton pump inhibitors of stomach acid tablets', 'glycocorticosteroids', 'corticosteroids', 'antibiotics', 'blood pressure', 'heart rate', 'respiratory rate', 'temperature', 'chest radiograph', 'Laboratory examination', 'white blood cells (WBC) count', 'haemoglobin level', 'platelet count', 'aspartate amino-transferase level', 'alanine aminotransferase level', 'blood glucose level', 'serum electrolyte concentrations', 'renal function tests', 'physical examination', 'culture', 'Cultures of blood and respiratory specimens', 'Thick and thin blood smears for malaria', 'Treatment', 'empirical therapy', 'lymphocyte count', 'absolute number of lymphocytes', 'CD4+ cell count', 'CD8+', 'HIV test', 'ELISA', 'qualitative HIV PCR', 'HIV RNA', 'blood cultures', 'therapy', 'CD4+ cell count', 'CD4+ cell count']","['few days later', 'few days later', 'few days later', 'few days later', '10 days', 'At the time of admission', '3rd day', '3rd day', 'day of admission', 'At that time', '20th day after discharge', '3rd month']"
339,1414004-1,16280070,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1414004.xml,Prolonged refractory status epilepticus following acute traumatic brain injury: a case report of excellent neurological recovery,"A previously healthy right-handed 20 year old woman sustained multiple injuries following a rollover motor vehicle collision. Her initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6, but deteriorated to 3 on scene. Her vehicle was found overturned. She was belted into the driver's seat with the shoulder belt compressing her neck. Her face was cyanotic. She was intubated on scene and transferred to hospital.
In the emergency department, her temperature was 35.7°C, blood pressure 112/66, heart rate 108 and oxygen saturation on 50% FiO2 was 98%. Pupils were 3 mm equal and reactive. Minimal withdrawal to pain in the lower extremities was noted. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric with equivocal plantar responses.
Initial laboratory investigations were normal. Injuries identified included a burst fracture of the 6th and 7th cervical vertebral bodies with canal narrowing of 50%, subluxation of the right 3rd cervical facet joint, and a right occipital condyle fracture. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head demonstrated a hypodensity in the left cerebellum. CT angiography revealed a dissection at C3 and complete occlusion at C7 of the right vertebral artery.
Six hours after admission, the patient had a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure that responded to 2 mg of IV lorazepam. A 20 mg/kg IV loading dose of phenytoin was then given followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg IV q8h. Two hours later, she was taken for decompression and fixation of C6 to T1. Twelve hours post-operatively, generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity was again noted, but resolved after 6 mg of IV lorazepam. One hour later, further generalized seizure activity did not respond to 8 mg of IV lorazepam, so three 100 mg boluses of intravenous propofol followed by an infusion at 50 μg/kg/minute was undertaken with clinical resolution of the seizures.
A repeat CT head confirmed an evolving left cerebellar infarct, but was otherwise unchanged. Continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) was initiated, which demonstrated ongoing and repeated right frontal electrographic seizures with secondary generalization. These were transiently suppressed with further bolus doses of 100 mg of propofol, but would recur despite increasing the infusion of propofol to 80 μg/kg/minute. Therefore, a loading dose of 700 mg of pentobarbital was given followed by an infusion at 1 to 5 mg/kg/hour to achieve burst suppression on cEEG with an interburst interval of 10 to 15 seconds. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the CT findings and also demonstrated a small area of contusion subcortically in the right frontal lobe.
Further history obtained from family and friends revealed no personal or family history of seizures, strokes or hypercoaguable states, no recent illness, no medications and no illicit drug use.
Every two to three days, the pentobarbital infusion was weaned, but as the patient emerged from burst suppression, electrographic seizures would recur on cEEG. In stepwise fashion, valproic acid, oral phenobarbital and levetiracetam were added, with doses reaching 500 mg tid, 90 mg tid and 2,000 mg bid, respectively, by the tenth day of her admission (Figure ). All anticonvulsants were maintained at therapeutic serum levels.
The patient experienced multiple complications felt in part to be related to the barbiturate coma, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis and ileus with microperforation and pelvic abscess formation requiring laparotomy. Therefore, after 13 days of ongoing RSE, the pentobarbital was changed to propofol 80 μg/kg/minute and midazolam 15 mg/hour continuous infusions. The infusion rates were titrated to achieve burst suppression on cEEG and were interrupted every two days to assess for ongoing seizures. Trials of a continuous ketamine infusion up to 5 mg/kg/hour and inhalational isoflurane with a minimum alveolar concentration of 1.0% did not result in ameliorating the RSE when burst suppression was interrupted.
On day 25 of her admission, while on propofol, midazolam, phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam, the interruption in the burst suppression showed no ongoing electrographic seizures. Over the next three days, the midazolam and propofol were discontinued while maintaining cEEG to ensure no seizure recurrence. On day 33 phenobarbital and valproic acid were discontinued, leaving only phenytoin 300 mg bid and levetiracetam 1,000 mg bid.
She was discharged from the intensive care unit on day 50. The patient has had one seizure since then, which was associated with a sub-therapeutic phenytoin level. Neuropsychological testing three months after the initial accident demonstrated mild difficulty with short-term memory, but was otherwise normal. She continues to undergo rehabilitation for her spinal cord injury and cerebellar stroke.","[[20.0, 'year']]",F,2005,"['shoulder', 'neck', 'face', 'heart', 'Pupils', 'lower extremities', 'plantar', '6th and 7th cervical vertebral bodies', 'canal', 'right 3rd cervical facet joint', 'right occipital condyle', 'head', 'left cerebellum', 'C3', 'C7 of the right vertebral artery', 'C6 to T1', 'head', 'left cerebellar', 'right frontal', 'right frontal lobe', 'deep vein', 'pelvic', 'spinal cord', 'cerebellar']","['healthy', 'injuries', 'rollover motor vehicle collision', 'shoulder belt compressing her neck', 'cyanotic', 'equal', 'reactive', 'withdrawal to pain', 'Reflexes', 'symmetric', 'equivocal plantar responses', 'Injuries', 'burst fracture', 'burst fracture of the 6th and 7th cervical vertebral bodies', 'canal narrowing', 'subluxation of the right 3rd cervical facet joint', 'right occipital condyle fracture', 'hypodensity', 'dissection', 'complete occlusion', 'generalized tonic-clonic seizure', 'generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity', 'generalized seizure activity', 'seizures', 'left cerebellar infarct', 'right frontal electrographic seizures', 'generalization', 'burst suppression', 'contusion subcortically', 'seizures', 'strokes', 'hypercoaguable states', 'illness', 'illicit drug use', 'burst suppression', 'electrographic seizures', 'therapeutic serum levels', 'complications', 'barbiturate coma', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'deep vein thrombosis', 'ileus', 'microperforation', 'pelvic abscess formation', 'RSE', 'burst suppression', 'seizures', 'RSE', 'burst suppression was interrupted', 'burst suppression', 'electrographic seizures', 'seizure recurrence', 'seizure', 'sub-therapeutic phenytoin level', 'difficulty with short-term memory', 'spinal cord injury', 'cerebellar stroke']","['lorazepam', 'phenytoin', 'lorazepam', 'lorazepam', 'propofol', 'propofol', 'propofol', 'pentobarbital', 'pentobarbital', 'valproic acid', 'phenobarbital', 'levetiracetam', 'pentobarbital', 'propofol', 'midazolam', 'ketamine', 'isoflurane', 'propofol', 'midazolam', 'phenytoin', 'valproic acid', 'levetiracetam', 'midazolam', 'propofol', 'phenobarbital', 'valproic acid', 'phenytoin', 'levetiracetam']","['20', 'emergency department', 'intensive care unit']","['Glasgow Coma Scale', 'GCS', 'intubated', 'temperature', 'blood pressure', 'heart rate', 'oxygen saturation', 'FiO2', 'laboratory', 'computed tomography (CT) scan of the head', 'CT angiography', 'decompression and fixation of C6 to T1', 'infusion', 'CT head', 'electroencephalography', 'cEEG', 'cEEG', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'MRI', 'CT', 'medications', 'cEEG', 'anticonvulsants', 'serum levels', 'laparotomy', 'infusion', 'cEEG', 'minimum alveolar concentration', 'cEEG', 'sub-therapeutic phenytoin level', 'phenytoin level', 'Neuropsychological testing', 'rehabilitation']","['Six hours after admission', 'Twelve hours post-operatively', 'post-operatively', '13 days', 'next three days', 'next three days', 'three months']"

She had undergone a colpohysterectomy for uterine descensus without ovariectomy three years earlier. Ultrasound showed an ovarian mass with both solid and cystic areas. The patient underwent a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
The right ovary, surgically resected, was greatly enlarged (27 × 12, 5 × 4 cm). Sections showed cystic areas containing soft yellow material and hairs, as well as solid areas with hemorrhage and necrosis. In contrast, the left ovary appeared normal. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with hematoxilin-eosin and Periodic acid-Schiff reagent. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using the streptavidin-biotin peroxidase method. The antibodies used were against cytokeratins (AE1/AE3, CAM 5.2, MNF 116) (Dako, Denmark), EMA, vimentin, alpha smooth muscle actin, estrogen and progesterone receptors, p53, p63 (all from Biogenex-Menarini, Netherland), CD10 and desmin (both from Diapath-Novocastra, Newcastle, United Kingdom). For each antibody, appropriate positive and negative controls were included.
The tumor had features of a carcinosarcoma with cystic areas delimited by squamous epithelium, focally without atypias (Figure ) but with transitional areas from benign through premalignant to ""in situ"" and infiltrating carcinoma. Hair follicle buds were sometimes present in proximity to the squamous components.
The sarcomatous component showed compact tissue composed of round cells arranged concentrically around small vessels, spindle, and pleomorphic cells with a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio (Figure ). Necrosis and hemorrhage were abundant. Interestingly, islands of SCC were distributed among sarcomatous areas, without a well-demarcated boundary.
The squamous component stained positively for EMA and cytokeratins AE1/AE3 (Figure ) and, MNF 116. In contrast, the stromal component was positive for vimentin, CD10 and, focally, for alpha smooth muscle actin.
Moreover, vimentin, alpha smooth muscle actin and CD10 were positive in atypical basal cells of the squamous epithelium infiltrating both lining cystic areas (Figures ).
Desmin was expressed in fewer than 5% of the stromal cells.
Estrogen receptors were negative. Progesterone receptors were positive in 10% of the sarcomatous cells. P53 and P63 showed positive nuclears staining in about 20% of the tumor cells, in both the sarcomatous and the squamous areas, and in the atypical basal cells of the squamous lining.","[[69.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['abdominal', 'pelvic', 'uterine', 'ovarian', 'right ovary', 'left ovary', 'Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues', 'Hair follicle buds', 'proximity to the squamous components', 'small vessels', 'spindle', 'pleomorphic cells', 'sarcomatous areas', 'squamous component', 'stromal component', 'basal cells of the squamous epithelium', 'both lining cystic areas', 'stromal cells']","['abdominal pain', 'pelvic mass', 'uterine descensus', 'ovarian mass', 'solid and cystic areas', 'surgically resected', 'enlarged', 'cystic areas', 'solid areas', 'hemorrhage', 'necrosis', 'left ovary appeared normal', 'tumor', 'carcinosarcoma', 'cystic areas', 'squamous epithelium', 'atypias', 'transitional areas', 'transitional areas from benign through premalignant', 'infiltrating carcinoma', 'Hair follicle buds were sometimes present in proximity to the squamous components', 'sarcomatous component', 'high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio', 'Necrosis', 'hemorrhage', 'islands of SCC', 'well-demarcated boundary', 'atypical basal cells of the squamous epithelium', 'Desmin', 'sarcomatous cells']","['CD10', 'desmin']","['69', 'Diapath-Novocastra, Newcastle, United Kingdom']","['colpohysterectomy', 'ovariectomy', 'Ultrasound', 'bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy', 'Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were stained', 'hematoxilin-eosin', 'Periodic acid-Schiff reagent', 'Immunohistochemical studies', 'antibodies', 'cytokeratins', 'AE1', 'AE1/AE3', 'AE3', 'CAM', 'MNF', 'EMA', 'vimentin', 'alpha smooth muscle actin', 'estrogen and progesterone receptors', 'p53', 'p63', 'CD10', 'desmin', 'EMA', 'cytokeratins AE1/AE3', 'MNF', 'vimentin', 'CD10', 'alpha smooth muscle actin', 'vimentin', 'alpha smooth muscle actin', 'CD10', 'Estrogen receptors', 'Progesterone receptors', 'P53', 'P63']",['three years earlier']

His chest radiograph revealed a perbipheral right lung opacity, and computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a right lower lobe soft tissue density mass [Figures , ]. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were not identified. Bronchoscopy was negative. Transthoracic fine-needle aspiration under CT guidance was not diagnostic. A complete study of bone, brain and abdomen was also performed to assess the stage of a presumed bronchogenic carcinoma and no extrapulmonary involvement was noted. Surgery was carried out to obtain diagnosis and achieve cure. The patient underwent a right lower lobectomy and complete lymph node dissection through a right posterolateral thoracotomy. Macroscopically, the mass appeared well-circumscribed and yellowish in colour on cut section. Microscopically the mass was composed of fibroblasts, collagen and inflammatory cells mainly of lymphocytes and plasma cells (Figure ). There was no mitotic activity. No microorganisms were detected even on special stains. The overall features suggested an inflammatory pseudotumor. All lymph nodes were negative for malignancy. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient discharged home on postoperative day 10. The patient remained well and asymptomatic two years later.","[[25.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['upper respiratory tract', 'right lung base', 'chest', 'perbipheral right lung', 'right lower lobe soft tissue', 'mediastinal lymph nodes', 'bone', 'brain', 'abdomen', 'extrapulmonary', 'lymph node', 'right posterolateral', 'lymph nodes']","['cough', 'bloody mucoid sputum', 'anorexia', 'upper respiratory tract infections', 'diminished breath sounds', 'normochromic', 'normocytic anaemia', 'low iron serum level', 'elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate', 'perbipheral right lung opacity', 'right lower lobe soft tissue density mass', 'Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes', 'bronchogenic carcinoma', 'extrapulmonary involvement', 'mass', 'mass', 'inflammatory cells', 'lymphocytes', 'plasma cells', 'mitotic activity', 'microorganisms', 'inflammatory pseudotumor', 'malignancy', 'postoperative period was uneventful', 'uneventful', 'well', 'asymptomatic']",[],['25'],"['examination', 'Laboratory', 'iron serum level', 'erythrocyte sedimentation rate', 'chest radiograph', 'computed tomography (CT)', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Transthoracic fine-needle aspiration under CT guidance', 'complete study of bone, brain and abdomen', 'Surgery', 'right lower lobectomy', 'complete lymph node dissection through a right posterolateral thoracotomy', 'special stains']","['previous two months', 'previous two months', 'two years', 'first hour', 'postoperative', 'two years later', 'two years later']"
342,1420325-1,16509976,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1420325.xml,A thyroid tumor extending to the parapharyngeal space,"A 22-year-old female patient was referred our clinic for evaluation of a painless neck mass, hoarseness and dysphagia. She first noticed the mass in the upper right neck two years earlier without any symptoms. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable.
Physical examination revealed a submucosal mass in the right lateral oropharyngeal wall with medial displacement of the right tonsil. A non-tender, firm, mobile mass measuring 4 × 4 cm. was detected deep to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle below the angle of the mandible. Superior extent of the mass could not be palpated in the neck. The telescopic examination of the larynx demonstrated a right sided, smooth mass narrowing the rima glottis. There were not any cranial nerve deficits other than the paralysis of the right vocal cord. The computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a large, contrast enhancing soft tissue lesion in the parapharyngeal space extending inferiorly to the level of the right thyroid lobe and pushing the larynx medially (Figure ). The magnetic resonance image (MRI) demonstrated the tumor between the PPS and the upper lobe of right thyroid lobe, narrowing the airway passage and lateral displacement of the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein (Figure ). The ultrasonographic evaluation of neck demonstrated a 4 × 4, 5 cm mass adjacent to the superior part of the right thyroid gland with rich vascularity.
Scintigraphic examination of the thyroid gland revealed homogenous distribution of the activity in the gland but no activity was noticed in the mass adjacent to the gland. Angiography and doppler usg findings suggested that the tumor had rich vascularity and the main blood supply was from the superior thyroid artery (Figure , ). The fine needle aspiration of the mass revealed the cellular aspirates with no colloid, and aspirates which included some microfollicular aggregates. However, no papillary folds, psammoma bodies, or nuclear grooves were detected (Figure ). It was reported as ""solid cellular nodule, microfollicular lesion"".
Cervical approach was preferred to remove the mass because it was thought to originate from the right thyroid gland. Under general anesthesia, following the skin incision, starting from the greater cornu of the hyoid bone and extending downwards vertically to the thyroid gland, the tumor with enlarged venous structures and measuring as 4,5 × 4,5 cm was identified. Blunt dissection easily detached the tumor from the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, prevertebral fascia and the skull base. The tumor was found to originate from the superior pole of the right thyroid gland, via a narrow stalk, and extended following the neurovascular bundle to the lower part of the parapharyngeal space. Following the removal of the mass, frozen section was performed, and follicular neoplasm that has suspicion of malignancy was reported. As the frozen artefact of the nuclei of the tumor cells, the exact diagnosis was postponed to the paraffin embedded tissue section. The cervical incision lengthened to gain access to visualize the thyroid gland. Total thyroidectomy was performed with the preservation of the both of the reccurent laryngeal nerves. Careful examination of the median compartment surrounding the thyroid gland did not reveal any lymphadenopathy.
On histologic examination, follicular variant of papillary carcinoma was diagnosed. The tumor had totally follicular architecture and the nuclei of the follicle epithelium were characteristic nuclei of the papillary carcinoma. The cells contained finely dispersed chromatin, which imparted empty appearance, giving rise to the designation glass nuclei (Figure ). The rest of the thyroid revealed lymhocytic thyroditis (Figure ). The patient did well postoperatively. There was no residual thyroid in postoperative I-131 scanning.

The male reported alcohol and cocaine use prior to being arrested, and the patient acknowledged that chaotic behavior related to the use of these substances had contributed to his crimes and eventual incarceration. While incarcerated, the individual reported initiating use of illicit (prescription) opiates, and his preferred route of administration was via nasal inhalation. Although the patient reported that his fellow inmates had frequently injected (he even reported assisting with injections), the patient denied injection use of illicit drugs in prison. The patient reported experiencing severe physical withdrawal symptoms during periods of non-opiate use in prison and soon became a regular user.
Upon release into the community, the patient reported that he had continued his xuse of diverted pharmaceutical opiates and that he had developed a pattern of use consistent with severe physical addiction. At the time of presentation at the clinic, the patient's urine tested positive for opiates. At that time, the patient reported that his unstable condition was such that he feared he might initiate intravenous opiate injection use if he did not do something to control his opiate cravings. The patient did not say why he had not injected opiates in prison but reported recognizing that injection opiate use would represent a further negative progression of his opiate addiction. After some discussion, the patient was started on methadone maintenance therapy, 10 mg per day, increasing 10 mg per day until desired therapeutic effect was reached.","[[20.0, 'year']]",M,2006,['nasal'],"['alcohol and cocaine use', 'chaotic behavior', 'use of these substances', 'use of illicit (prescription) opiates', 'injected', 'injection use of illicit drugs', 'physical withdrawal symptoms', 'non-opiate use', 'diverted pharmaceutical opiates', 'physical addiction', 'unstable condition', 'intravenous opiate injection use', 'opiate injection use', 'opiate cravings', 'injection opiate use', 'opiate addiction']",['methadone'],"['20', 'outpatient', 'addiction medicine clinic', 'Calgary, Canada']",['urine tested'],"['At that time', 'At that time']"

She was previously healthy, and was on oral oestroprogestative since one year. Two years ago, CMV IgG tested negative. Leukocyte count was 9700 cells/mm3, platelets were 80000/mm3, and C-reactive protein level was 110 mg/L (N: < 10). ALT level was 49 U/L (N: < 37), AST was 45 U/L (N: < 36), γ-glutamyltranspeptidase level was 49 (N: < 36), with normal LDH, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and INR values. Haptoglobin value was 2.06 g/l (N: 0.28–1.78). Prothrombin time and fibrinogen level were normal. An abdominal CT scan showed an enlarged spleen and a thrombus in the splenic vein extending into the portal trunk. A fresh thrombus was also evident in the right hepatic vein (see figure). A thorough evaluation for a hypercoagulable state was performed: homocystein level: 6.7 μmol/l (N: < 15); antithrombin III: 86% (N: 75–125); protein C: 74% (N: 70–140); protein S: 88% (N: 50–120); factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210 genes: not mutated; anticardiolipin antibodies: negative; antinuclear antibodies: < 1/60; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: absence of deficience of GPI-linked proteins by flow cytometry. Although a bone marrow analysis was not performed, an overt myeloproliferative disorder was deemed unlikely in the absence of grossly elevated white blood cells and platelet count, no eosinophilia, basophilia, or atypical platelet morphology on the peripheral smear examination. We felt that the probability of an early hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of a pre-existing liver disease was extremely low. The value of AFP was 4 ng/ml (N < 15 ng/ml)
Blood cultures remained sterile, and serological tests for hepatitis A, B, C and HIV were negative. Serum immunoglobulins were as follows: IgG: 19 g/l (N: 6.7–13); IgA: 4.3 g/l (N: 0.7–2.9); IgM: 2.6 (N: 0.4–2.6). Typisation of circulating lymphocytes (T, B, NK) showed normal values.
Serological testing for CMV showed elevated titers of IgG and IgM. CMV DNA using real-time PCR was detectable at a level of 5 copies per 106, with a partial inhibition of amplification. EBV DNA was negative. Mild duodenal inflammation was observed at endoscopy, with viral-type inclusions visible in endothelial cells seen in intestinal biopsy.
Intravenous heparin at a therapeutic level was administered, and oral contraception was stopped. The patient remained febrile (temperature 39°C), and the abdominal pain increased in intensity despite full-dose anticoagulation. The AST and ALT levels increased (76 U/L and 111 U/L, respectively). A repeat abdominal CT scan showed moderate ascites. Using a transjugular approach, direct venography was performed after a difficult cannulation of the right hepatic vein, demonstrating a ""spider-web"" network pattern typically seen in Budd-Chiari syndrome (see figure). The hepatic venous pressure gradient showed moderate portal hypertension, with a value of 9 mmHg (N: < 4). Liver histology (see figure) showed acute hepatitis with a mononuclear and neutrophilic infiltrate, scattered areas of hepatocyte necrosis, and a microgranulomatous cell reaction. An immunohistochemistry study was performed on the liver biopsy specimen to detect CMV[], but remained negative. There were no features of a pre-existing liver disease, and no lesions (plasma cells infiltration, interface hepatitis) that may suggest the presence of auto-immune hepatitis[]. In addition, a marked sinusoidal dilatation and congestion in the centrilobular regions were consistent with a hepatic vein outflow obstruction[].
Five days after liver biopsy, transaminases returned to normal values. The patient remained febrile with mild abdominal pain persisting another 3 weeks. At 5 months, control ultrasonography showed persistently obstructed right hepatic, splenic and portal vein with a cavernoma, but no ascites.","[[36.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['abdominal', 'abdominal', 'spleen', 'splenic vein', 'portal trunk', 'right hepatic vein', 'bone marrow', 'liver', 'duodenal', 'endothelial cells', 'intestinal', 'abdominal', 'abdominal', 'right hepatic vein', 'hepatic venous', 'Liver', 'liver', 'liver', 'sinusoidal', 'centrilobular regions', 'hepatic vein', 'liver', 'abdominal', 'right hepatic', 'splenic', 'portal vein']","['abdominal pain', 'fever', 'healthy', 'enlarged spleen', 'thrombus', 'thrombus', 'hypercoagulable state', 'deficience of GPI-linked proteins', 'myeloproliferative', 'myeloproliferative disorder', 'elevated white blood cells and platelet count', 'eosinophilia', 'basophilia', 'atypical platelet morphology', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'liver disease', 'hepatitis A, B, C', 'HIV', 'elevated titers of IgG and IgM', 'CMV', 'partial inhibition of amplification', 'duodenal inflammation', 'viral-type inclusions visible in endothelial cells', 'febrile', 'abdominal pain', 'ascites', 'spider-web"" network pattern', 'Budd-Chiari syndrome', 'portal hypertension', 'hepatitis', 'mononuclear and neutrophilic infiltrate', 'hepatocyte necrosis', 'microgranulomatous cell reaction', 'CMV', 'liver disease', 'lesions', 'plasma cells infiltration', 'interface hepatitis', 'auto-immune hepatitis', 'sinusoidal dilatation', 'dilatation', 'congestion', 'hepatic vein outflow obstruction', 'febrile', 'abdominal pain', 'obstructed', 'cavernoma', 'ascites']",['heparin'],"['36', '1/60']","['oestroprogestative', 'CMV IgG', 'Leukocyte count', 'platelets', 'C-reactive protein level', 'ALT level', 'AST', '-glutamyltranspeptidase level', 'LDH', 'alkaline phosphatase', 'bilirubin', 'INR', 'Haptoglobin', 'Prothrombin time', 'fibrinogen level', 'abdominal CT scan', 'homocystein level', 'antithrombin III', 'protein C', 'protein S', 'S', 'factor V Leiden', 'prothrombin 20210 genes', 'anticardiolipin antibodies', 'antinuclear antibodies', 'paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria', 'flow cytometry', 'bone marrow analysis', 'white blood cells', 'platelet count', 'peripheral smear examination', 'AFP', 'Blood cultures', 'serological tests for hepatitis A, B, C and HIV', 'hepatitis A, B, C and HIV', 'Serum immunoglobulins', 'IgG', 'IgA', 'IgM', 'Typisation of circulating lymphocytes (T, B, NK)', 'Serological testing for CMV', 'CMV DNA', 'real-time PCR', 'EBV DNA', 'endoscopy', 'intestinal biopsy', 'contraception', 'temperature', 'anticoagulation', 'AST', 'ALT levels', 'abdominal CT scan', 'direct venography', 'difficult cannulation of the right hepatic vein', 'hepatic venous pressure gradient', 'Liver histology', 'immunohistochemistry study', 'liver biopsy', 'liver biopsy', 'transaminases', 'control ultrasonography']","['3 weeks', '3 weeks', 'since one year', 'Two years ago', 'Five days', 'another 3 weeks', '3 weeks', '5 months']"

He reported 6 similar episodes, attributed to small bowel obstruction in the past 4 years, which required hospitalization and resolved with conservative treatment. He also admitted chronic constipation for the last 6 years, anorexia and 15 kg weight loss since his last admission (April 2004). He had no surgical or other medical history. On examination, he was in distress, but afebrile and haemodynamically stable. His abdomen was distended but non-tender, with increased bowel sounds in pitch and frequency. No palpable abdominal mass or organomegaly and no external hernias were present. Laboratory blood analyses were within normal limits. Plain abdominal X-ray showed few air-fluid levels centrally located, without free intraperitoneal gas. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities. Contrast-enhanced abdomen computed tomography, performed on the same day, confirmed the diagnosis of small bowel ileus without providing any diagnostic clues. The patient was admitted to the general surgical ward and ileus resolved by day 3 conservatively. Endoscopy of upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and biopsies from the duodenum and colon provided normal findings. Although symptoms of obstruction had abated, the history of multiple relapses, the patient's complaints for poor quality of life and multiple admissions, as well as the undefined origin of the underlying pathology led to an exploratory laparotomy on day 7. On surgery, a fibrous capsule covering all the abdominal viscera was revealed, in which small bowel loops were encased, with the presence of interloop adhesions. The liver, stomach, appendix, right and left colon, as well as the sigmoid, were also covered and the greater omentum looked hypoplastic and encased in fibrous tissue (Figure ). Incision of the thick membrane and extensive adhesiolysis of small bowel loops were performed without loop resection. Histology of the membrane showed thickened fibrocollagenous tissue without inflammation. A diagnosis of idiopathic sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (abdominal cocoon) was established, due to intraoperative findings and by ruling-out any other condition explaining the patient's pathology. Postoperatively, a forgotten small bowel follow-through performed elsewhere in 2000 was brought to our attention by the patient, showing ""ileal loops bunched and confined in the lower abdomen and pelvis apparently due to adhesions"" (Figure ).

A detailed study of mutation analysis was carried out by Dr. Gau-Tyan Lin[]. A homozygous intronic splice-site mutation at the +1 position of intron 5 (682+1G→A) in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) was identified. His mother was a heterozygous carrier of this mutation[]. Parental consanguinity was confirmed by the DNA study. With early onset at 7th day postnatal, he suffered blisters and erosions at all skin of his body. He had a characteristic mitten deformity of hands and feet. Since the age of 21 years, he had received lots of surgical procedures including separation of digits, release of flexion contracture, and skin grafting for ulcers, skin defect and pseudosyndactyly of his hands and feet. In the meanwhile, repeated skin infection was experienced. Besides he had anemia, malnutrition, and chronic constipation with stool impaction for years. Laxatives (magnesium oxide 250 mg 3 times per day and sennosides 20 mg before sleep) were given.
Due to skin ulcers and wound infection of right hand and right low leg, he was admitted to the hospital. He received wound debridement of right low leg and right hand with separation of first web of right hand. Three days after the operation, abdominal pain and distention were complained. Enema (glycerol 60 ml) was given, but to no avail. Vomiting and abdominal discomfort got worse. White blood count: 25.50 × 1000/ul was noted. Computed tomography (CT) of abdomen demonstrated extra-luminal free air in the peritoneal cavity and stool impaction in the distal sigmoid colon with marked distention of colonic loop (Figure ). Hallow organ perforation with peritonitis was highly suspected. Emergent laparotomy was performed. During operation, sigmoid colon perforation with ischemic bowel and fecal impaction in the distal sigmoid colon were noted. Hartmann's procedure (resection of ischemic bowel and colostomy ) and intra-abdominal abscess drainage were done. Unfortunately septic shock developed.

At the emergency department initial evaluation revealed a rapid pulse rate and the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a wide QRS complex tachycardia, with a right bundle branch block morphology, compatible with VT (). This arrhythmia was successfully converted by 200 J external cardioversion. She was diabetic, with a long history of hypertension and mild hyperlipidemia. Her medications included atenolol 100 mg/d, amiodarone 200 mg/d, enalapril 5 mg/bid, and glibenclamide 5 mg/bid. Physical examination was unremarkable. The 12-lead ECG during sinus rhythm showed sinus bradycardia, with a long QT interval (QTc=568 msec, probably because of amiodarone; QTc before starting amiodaron was normal) and diffuse nonspecific T wave inversion in inferior and all the precordial leads (). Chest radiogram (CXR) revealed no abnormality. In echocardiography, LV was mildly dilated (LVEDD=60mm), with mild dysfunction (LVEF=45%), mild isolated septal hypertrophy and posterior wall thinning (IVS=14.4mm, PW=6mm). There was no significant valvular lesion, and right heart chambers had normal dimensions and function. In laboratory evaluation, blood sugar and creatinine were mildly elevated, there was no electrolyte or acid-base abnormality, and cardiac specific enzymes were normal.
Her past medical history was remarkable for her presentation with atypical chest pain, palpitation, and presyncope, nine years ago. Myocardial perfusion imaging at that time, revealed a perfusion defect in the anteroseptal wall, and 24 hr-Holter monitoring showed episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Coronary angiogram showed normal epicardial coronary arteries. LV angiography was omitted because of relatively good LV function and no evidence of valvular heart disease at echocardiographic study. Tilt-test was done for a history of presyncope. At the active stage, after receiving nitroglycerin spray, she developed a hemodynamically stable sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, which was controlled with intravenous lidocaine. She was recommended oral amiodaron after discharge from hospital, and had been asymptomatic until several days before her recent presentation.

A case report,"In 1982, a 74 year old diabetic man presented with weight loss, anorrhexia and fever. Physical examination showed hepatosplenomegaly. Laborotory findings were a Hb: 9.4 g/d1, WBC: 1800/ml, PLT: 180,000, low albumin with normal serum iron. With clinical impression of hypersplenism vs lymphoma, lymph node excisional biopsy and imprint smear were made.
Cytologic smears were air-dried and stained by Pappenheim. Pappenheim stain is equivalent to Wright-Gimsa/ Diff- Quick stain. The smear was cellular and contained mainly (monomorphic) population of lymphocytes with round to oval nucleus and fine, evenly dispersed chromatin. Cytoplasm were light blue to clear. Rare cells with nuclear irregularity were noted. There were also small and large groups and clusters of epitheloid histiocytes intermingled with the lymphocytes (Fig. ). Epitheloid histiocytes shows oval to bean shaped nucleus with finely dispered chromatin, twice the size of the lymphocytes with ample grayish granular cytoplasm(Fig. ). However no distinct granuloma were noted. Multinucleated giant cell or lymphogranular bodies were not noted.
Histologic sections of the lymph node showed a completely effaced architecture with exuberant proliferation of histiocytes in cluster and sheets, intermingled with small round to oval neoplastic lymphocytes (Fig ). The final histologic report was ""Lennert's lymphoma, with possibility of immunocytoma and epitheloid rich Hogkins disease, however cytomorphology is against Hogkins disease""(histologic diagnosis made by K. Lennert in Kiel, Germany, 1982). Immunohistochemical study (markers done not known) was in favor of an epitheloid rich T cell lymphoma. Reanalysis of stored paraffin blocks from 1982 showed an immunophenotype typical of peripheral T cell lymphoma with strong uniform positivity for CD5 and CD4 (Fig. 5) and negative for CD8, CD20. Gene rearrargement for T cell receptor was performed which confirmed a monoclonal process. Bone marrow biopsy was done and reported as extensive infiltration by malignant lymphoma cells with remarkable presence of macrophages and epitheloid cells with fibrosis (histologic diagnosis made by Lutz Dietrich Leder in Kiel, Germany, 1982) which he could not classify but also thought of hairy cell leukemia.","[[74.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['lymph node', 'nucleus', 'lymph node', 'Bone marrow']","['diabetic', 'weight loss', 'anorrhexia', 'fever', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'hypersplenism', 'lymphoma', 'cellular', 'monomorphic) population of lymphocytes', 'round to oval nucleus', 'fine', 'evenly dispersed chromatin', 'dispersed chromatin', 'Cytoplasm were light blue to clear', 'Rare cells', 'nuclear irregularity', 'clusters of epitheloid histiocytes', 'clusters of epitheloid histiocytes intermingled with the lymphocytes', 'Epitheloid histiocytes', 'oval to bean shaped nucleus', 'finely dispered chromatin', 'twice the size of the lymphocytes', 'grayish granular cytoplasm', 'granular cytoplasm', 'granuloma', 'Multinucleated giant cell', 'lymphogranular bodies', 'effaced architecture', 'proliferation of histiocytes', 'neoplastic lymphocytes', ""Lennert's lymphoma"", 'immunocytoma', 'epitheloid rich Hogkins disease', 'Hogkins disease', 'epitheloid rich T cell lymphoma', 'immunophenotype typical of peripheral T cell lymphoma', 'strong uniform positivity for CD5 and CD4', 'monoclonal process', 'infiltration by malignant lymphoma cells', 'epitheloid cells', 'fibrosis', 'hairy cell leukemia']",[],"['1982', '74', 'K.

349,1434765-1,16539714,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1434765.xml,Circle of Willis variation in a complex stroke presentation: a case report,"A 63-year-old right-handed woman attended her local hospital with a left hemiparesis of sudden onset 24 hours after a RTA. Her motor vehicle had collided with a parked vehicle. There was neither loss of consciousness nor any definite head or whiplash injury. Within a further 24 hours she developed right leg weakness. Computed tomography (CT) brain scan revealed a small low-density area in the right fronto-parietal region only; a CT scan of her cervical spine was normal. Given her progressive triplegia, immediate transfer to our centre was made, to exclude cervical spinal cord injury.
Initial assessment revealed her to be orientated with fluent speech. However, she had evidence of cognitive impairment with an inappropriate jovial affect, poor cognitive estimates and concrete thinking, bradyphrenia and was unable to provide a reliable history. Additional history was obtained from her husband and family. There was no preceding history of cognitive decline but some reduced self-care and hygiene, weight loss of approximately 8 kilograms over three months, and altered bowel habit. Her family had witnessed three episodes of left arm monoparesis, lasting between minutes and 1–2 hours, in the 48 hours preceding her accident. Twenty-four hours after her accident she developed a dense left hemiparesis of sudden onset.
She consumed less than 2 units of alcohol per week, was an ex-smoker, and had no other past medical history of note. She had a family history of ischaemic heart disease.
General examination was unremarkable and she was in sinus rhythm. Neurological examination revealed impaired volitional saccades to the left, but normal targeted saccades. Snout and palmomental reflexes were present. Mild left sided visuospatial dysfunction was present. No sensory inattention was demonstrated. She had a dense left hemiparesis (MRC grade 0 arm and leg) and mild right leg monoparesis (MRC grade 4). Deep tendon reflexes were brisk bilaterally, and both plantar responses were extensor. There was no sensory level.
Formal neuropsychological assessment later confirmed specific difficulties with visual memory, executive functioning and perceptual/constructional abilities.
Urgent brain and cervical spine MRI, revealed an ischaemic lesion in the right fronto-parietal region but no structural cervical cord pathology. Diffusion weighted images were not obtained. A repeat MRI brain scan, 8 days after the onset of left hemiparesis showed additional infarction in the distal left anterior cerebral artery territory.
Comprehensive serial blood tests revealed the following abnormal results (normal ranges and units in brackets): white blood cell count between 11.6 and 13.9 (4 to 11 × 109/L), C-reactive protein between 17.8 and 49.5 (< 8 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate between 54 and 65 (5 to 15 mm/h), total serum cholesterol 5.7 (<5 mmol/L), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 15.7 (0 to 3.5 ng/mL). Carotid ultrasound examination revealed a right internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis >85%, whilst all other vessels were normal. Routine cerebrospinal fluid examination was normal. CTA neck confirmed the right ICA stenosis, but no significant left ICA disease. CTA circle of Willis (CoW) showed the right A1 anterior cerebral artery (ACA) segment to be dominant, the left A1 ACA segment to be absent, and an anterior communicating artery (AcoA) aneurysm (Figure ). The remainder of the CoW was considered to be normal. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no cardiac embolic source. A colonoscopy revealed a rectal tumour, confirmed on biopsy to be a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Pharmacological treatment included aspirin, pravastatin and perindopril. She also received care from a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation team including physiotherapy. By 10 days after the onset of the left hemiparesis, improvement was noted in all of her deficits, and by 18 days she was regaining power in the left hand and wrist. She was transferred back to her referring hospital for management of her rectal tumour.
The neurological formulation at discharge was one of symptomatic right internal carotid artery stenosis and embolic stroke. It is possible that the RTA was a complication of left-sided visuospatial dysfunction. The subsequent presentation is consistent with multiple bilateral embolic strokes, secondary to CoW variation.","[[63.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['head', 'whiplash', 'right leg', 'brain', 'right fronto-parietal region', 'cervical spine', 'cervical', 'cervical spinal cord', 'bowel', 'left arm', 'heart', 'Neurological', 'Snout', 'palmomental', 'arm', 'leg', 'right leg', 'Deep tendon', 'both plantar', 'neuropsychological', 'brain', 'cervical spine', 'right fronto-parietal region', 'structural cervical cord', 'brain', 'distal left anterior cerebral artery territory', 'Carotid', 'right internal carotid artery', 'ICA', 'vessels', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'neck', 'right ICA', 'left ICA', 'right A1 anterior cerebral artery (ACA) segment', 'left A1 ACA segment', 'anterior communicating artery', 'AcoA', 'CoW', 'cardiac', 'rectal', 'left hand', 'wrist', 'rectal', 'right internal carotid artery']","['left hemiparesis', 'RTA', 'collided', 'loss of consciousness', 'head or whiplash injury', 'whiplash injury', 'injury', 'right leg weakness', 'low-density area', 'triplegia', 'cervical spinal cord injury', 'orientated', 'fluent speech', 'cognitive impairment', 'inappropriate jovial affect', 'poor cognitive estimates', 'cognitive estimates', 'concrete thinking', 'bradyphrenia', 'cognitive decline', 'reduced self-care and hygiene', 'weight loss', 'altered bowel habit', 'left arm monoparesis', 'accident', 'left hemiparesis', 'ex-smoker', 'ischaemic heart disease', 'unremarkable', 'sinus rhythm', 'impaired volitional saccades', 'normal targeted saccades', 'reflexes', 'left sided visuospatial dysfunction', 'sensory inattention', 'left hemiparesis', 'right leg monoparesis', 'Deep tendon reflexes were brisk bilaterally', 'both plantar responses were extensor', 'sensory level', 'difficulties with visual memory', 'difficulties with visual memory, executive functioning and perceptual/constructional abilities', 'executive functioning', 'ischaemic lesion', 'structural cervical cord pathology', 'left hemiparesis', 'infarction', 'stenosis', 'right ICA stenosis', 'left ICA disease', 'right A1 anterior cerebral artery (ACA) segment to be dominant', 'left A1 ACA segment to be absent', 'aneurysm', 'cardiac embolic source', 'rectal tumour', 'adenocarcinoma', 'left hemiparesis', 'deficits', 'regaining power', 'rectal tumour', 'right internal carotid artery stenosis', 'embolic stroke', 'RTA', 'left-sided visuospatial dysfunction', 'bilateral embolic strokes', 'CoW variation']","['aspirin', 'pravastatin', 'perindopril']","['63', 'centre']","['Computed tomography (CT) brain scan', 'CT scan of her cervical spine', 'MRC', 'MRC', 'brain and cervical spine MRI', 'Diffusion weighted images', 'MRI brain scan', 'Comprehensive serial blood tests', 'white blood cell count', 'C-reactive protein', 'erythrocyte sedimentation rate', 'total serum cholesterol', 'carcinoembryonic antigen', 'CEA', 'Carotid ultrasound examination', 'cerebrospinal fluid examination', 'CTA neck', 'CTA circle of Willis (CoW)', 'transthoracic echocardiogram', 'colonoscopy', 'biopsy', 'Pharmacological treatment', 'physiotherapy']","['24 hours', '24 hours', 'over three months', 'Twenty-four hours', 'Twenty-four hours', '8 days', '10 days', '18 days']"
350,1435756-1,16553945,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1435756.xml,Deep neck infection complicating lymphadenitis caused by Streptococcus intermedius in an immunocompetent child,"A 14-year old boy presented to his local physician with a 2-week history of marked swelling in the left lateral cervical region. There was no history of fever, headache, rash, or joint pain. One month earlier the child had completed a course of treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate for pharyngotonsillitis. This infection had followed on the heels of a case of left otitis media, which had been successfully treated with the same antibiotic. Over the past three months, he had undergone repeated orthodontic procedures which were associated with some degree of gingivitis. The parents could not recall whether or not any treatment had been prescribed for the gingival lesions.
After five days of treatment with ceftriaxone (25 mg/kg once daily) the cervical mass was unchanged and the child was referred to our hospital. On admission, he was found to be in good clinical condition and all vital signs were normal, including temperature. The physical examination revealed a firm non-tender mass on the left side of the neck. It was relatively non-elastic in consistency and the overlying skin was mildly erythematous. The palatine tonsils were both hypertrophic and the left one was medially displaced; velar and tongue motility were normal. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory data included a peripheral white blood cell count of 10.3 × 109/liter with 42% segmented neutrophils, hemoglobin 12.9 g/dl, platelet count 202 × 109/liter, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 68 mm/h, C-reactive protein (CRP) 44.1 mg/liter, and ferritin 249 ng/ml. The Mantoux intradermal reaction was negative at 72 hours. Blood cultures were persistently negative, and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels, serum copper levels, and neutrophil chemiluminescence findings were within normal ranges. Serological tests for Epstein-Barr virus, Bartonella henselae, Cytomegalovirus, and Toxoplasma gondii were all negative. Ultrasound of the left lateral cervical region showed a solid mass measuring 3 × 3.5 cm around the carotid bifurcation. It was surrounded by small lymph nodes with a maximum diameter of 1.5 cm. The chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound findings were normal.
On the suspicion that the child was suffering from mycobacteriosis provoked by the recent orthodontic work, empirical treatment with oral clarithromycin (250 mg BID) and ciprofloxacin (250 mg BID) was started. After seven days, an open lymph-node biopsy revealed purulent drainage, which was collected for histopathologic and microbiological analyses. Two drains were positioned within the wound and attached to low-grade suction for ten days. The cytologic findings were consistent with lymphadenitis. In light of the microbiological findings (discussed below), clarithromycin was discontinued, and the patient was placed on cefotaxime (1000 mg three times/day). One week later, the dimensions of the neck mass seemed to be slightly decreased on ultrasonography. However, a computerized-tomography (CT) scan of the head, neck, and mediastinum showed that the swelling was much more extensive than previously thought. It was only partially lymphoadenopathic, and fluid-containing areas alternating with zones of non-uniform enhancement were observed throughout the left parotid region, parapharyngeal space, tonsil pillar, the posterolateral wall of the pharynx, the posterior cervical and carotid spaces, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and the superficial musculofascial layer. After two more weeks of treatment, an objective improvement was noted. Cefotaxime was discontinued and the patient was discharged on acetoxyethylcefuroxime (500 mg BID). One month later, the child returned to our hospital for a follow-up visit after completion of four weeks of acetoxyethylcefuroxime therapy. An area of persistent painless swelling was noted and confirmed by CT in the left submandibular region. Surgical exploration revealed a large abscess in the submandibular salivary gland. After vessel and duct resection, the decision was made to proceed with the complete removal of the infected gland. After a total of six weeks of therapy, acetoxyethylcefuroxime was discontinued, and patient's neck CT scan confirmed the complete resolution of the abscess. He was discharged after a total hospitalization of 32 days and is currently being followed in our outpatient clinic. Twelve months after discharge, there are no signs of abscess recurrence or other types of infection.","[[14.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['left lateral cervical region', 'joint', 'heels', 'gingival', 'cervical', 'left side of the neck', 'skin', 'palatine tonsils', 'velar', 'tongue motility', 'left lateral cervical region', 'carotid bifurcation', 'lymph nodes', 'chest', 'abdominal', 'lymph-node', 'neck', 'head', 'neck', 'mediastinum', 'left parotid region', 'parapharyngeal space', 'tonsil pillar', 'posterolateral wall of the pharynx', 'posterior cervical', 'carotid spaces', 'sternocleidomastoid muscle', 'superficial musculofascial layer', 'left submandibular region', 'submandibular salivary gland', 'vessel', 'duct', 'gland', 'neck']","['swelling', 'fever', 'headache', 'rash', 'joint pain', 'pharyngotonsillitis', 'infection', 'left otitis media', 'gingivitis', 'gingival lesions', 'cervical mass', 'mass', 'good clinical condition', 'mass', 'non-elastic in consistency', 'erythematous', 'hypertrophic', 'left one was medially displaced', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'Bartonella henselae', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Toxoplasma gondii', 'solid mass', 'surrounded by small lymph nodes', 'lymph nodes', 'mycobacteriosis', 'purulent drainage', 'wound', 'lymphadenitis', 'neck mass', 'swelling', 'lymphoadenopathic', 'fluid-containing areas', 'zones of non-uniform enhancement', 'improvement', 'swelling', 'abscess', 'infected gland', 'abscess', 'abscess', 'infection']","['amoxicillin-clavulanate', 'ceftriaxone', 'clarithromycin', 'ciprofloxacin', 'clarithromycin', 'cefotaxime', 'Cefotaxime', 'acetoxyethylcefuroxime', 'acetoxyethylcefuroxime', 'acetoxyethylcefuroxime']","['14-year', 'outpatient clinic']","['treatment', 'antibiotic', 'orthodontic procedures', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'vital signs', 'temperature', 'physical examination', 'physical examination', 'Laboratory data', 'peripheral white blood cell count', 'segmented neutrophils', 'hemoglobin', 'platelet count', 'erythrocyte sedimentation rate', 'ESR', 'C-reactive protein', 'CRP', 'ferritin', 'Mantoux intradermal reaction', 'Blood cultures', 'angiotensin-converting enzyme levels', 'serum copper levels', 'neutrophil chemiluminescence', 'Serological tests', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'Bartonella henselae', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Ultrasound of the left lateral cervical region', 'chest X-ray', 'abdominal ultrasound', 'empirical treatment', 'open lymph-node biopsy', 'histopathologic', 'microbiological', 'Two drains were positioned within the wound and attached to low-grade suction', 'cytologic', 'microbiological', 'ultrasonography', 'computerized-tomography (CT) scan of the head, neck, and mediastinum', 'treatment', 'CT', 'Surgical exploration', 'vessel and duct resection', 'complete removal of the infected gland', 'therapy', 'neck CT scan']","['2-week', 'One month earlier', 'One month earlier', 'past three months', '72 hours', 'After seven days', 'ten days', 'One week later']"

He had remained healthy on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole alone for many years. In April 2003 he was hospitalized for fever and chills after returning from a trip to the Bahamas. Blood and urine cultures, cytomegalovirus serologies, cryptococcal antigen, and a transthoracic echocardiogram were not diagnostic. He had evidence of remote Epstein-Barr virus infection. A computed tomography scan of his chest showed new necrotic subcarinal and right hilar lymph nodes and two calcified granulomata in the right lower lobe. Inpatient intravenous vancomycin, ceftazidime, and voriconazole followed by outpatient oral voriconazole and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were not curative. One month later, while on his outpatient regimen, repeat blood, sputum, and urine cultures were again negative. Cerebrospinal fluid examination was unremarkable. Gallium and Indium scans showed increased uptake in the right cervical and anterior mediastinal lymph nodes. Mediastinoscopy with biopsy of carinal lymph nodes showed caseating granulomatous inflammation. Calcofluor white, AFB (acid-fast bacillus), and gram stains were negative as were fungal and bacterial cultures. In addition, AFB cultures were negative after eight weeks. Because of three months of fever, chills, and 10-lb weight loss despite empiric therapy, the patient was referred to the National Institutes of Health.
MRI of the chest showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the precarinal, subcarinal, and hilar regions with extensive necrosis (in , see A). Fevers, chills, fatigue, and night sweats persisted despite addition of azithromycin and moxifloxacin. Five months after symptom onset, he developed new painful left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Given the lack of response to empiric antimicrobials and the lack of microbiologic diagnosis, four involved left cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes were removed. Pathology showed extensive necrotizing pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis with microabscess formation (B and D). Fungal, gram, and AFB stains on sectioned lymph nodes were negative. A Warthin-Starry stain showed scant coccobacillary forms (C). A novel gram-negative rod grew from three lymph node cultures on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar plates after four days of incubation.
The patient was initially treated in the fall of 2003 with doxycycline, meropenem, and a steroid taper. His remaining lymph nodes decreased in size over subsequent months. However, fever and enlarging lymphadenopathy returned in the fall of 2004. Since that time, he has required cervical lymph node excisions on four separate occasions.

Eight weeks after transplantation (d59) he was admitted to another hospital following a road traffic accident. Whilst driving he had experienced sudden onset of drowsiness with headache and numbness in his fingers and toes. He temporarily lost consciousness and collided with another vehicle. Computed tomography (CT) scan of his head showed no abnormality and he was discharged home the following day. The following week he was readmitted (d66). He had a month history of persistent frontal headache, relieved by simple analgesic. He was intermittently confused and unable to recognize members of his family. This was associated with unsteady gait and slurred speech. During these episodes he appeared withdrawn and somewhat blank. Episodes lasted 1–8 hours. He had had one grand mal convulsion witnessed at home. There was no previous history or family history of neurological disease. On admission, he was afebrile with blood pressure of 120/75. He had no focal neurological deficit and no meningism. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was normal: microscopy, Gram and Zeihl-Nielson stain, cytology, virology, glucose, protein, cultures and India-ink for cryptococcus were unremarkable. Blood cultures, blood count, Chest and skull X-ray were normal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed sharpening and spikes independently in both temporal lobes consistent with temporal lobe partial epilepsy. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain showed multiple areas of low signal intensity (T1-weighted FLASH) in the pons, medulla oblongata, basal ganglia and also in the cerebral hemispheres (figure ). These lesions were reported as 'consistent with small vessel ischemia secondary to hypertension'. The diagnosis of partial epilepsy was made and he was started on lamotrigine. His renal function remained stable. Magnesium was consistently at the lower limit of normal range 0.6 mmol/l (normal range 0.6 – 1.1 mmol/l), cholesterol 4.5 mmol/l (2.3 – 5.2 mmol/l). The tacrolimus level was kept within range 8–15 ng/dl.
He was readmitted three weeks later (d113) having had further fits. He was agitated, psychotic with visual hallucinations. No focal neurology was found and he rapidly became obtunded with a Glasgow coma score of 6–8/15. Repeat CT and MRI were unchanged. Lumbar puncture revealed high open pressure and raised protein 1.3 g/l but CSF analysis was otherwise normal. Repeat EEG was consisted with complex partial status epileptics with ""frequent frontal notched theta activity"". He was treated with antibiotic and antifungal agents and phenytoin infusion. There was no improvement in his condition and a diagnosis of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity was made (tacrolimus 10 ng/ml). Tacrolimus was switched to cyclosporine. Over the next few days he showed rapid and progressive improvement. He recovered fully and was discharge home. He has had no further seizure activity nor neurological symptoms since tacrolimus had been stopped. He continues to do well. A MRI scan performed in 2004 no longer showed the earlier lesions.","[[42.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['renal', 'Renal', 'glomerular', 'renal', 'kidney', 'renal', 'fingers', 'toes', 'head', 'frontal', 'neurological', 'neurological', 'Cerebrospinal fluid', 'Chest', 'skull', 'both temporal lobes', 'temporal lobe', 'brain', 'pons', 'medulla oblongata', 'basal ganglia', 'cerebral hemispheres', 'small vessel', 'renal', 'Lumbar', 'frontal', 'neurological']","['hypertension', 'renal failure', 'vascular pathology', 'primary glomerular disease', 'kidney functioned', 'acute rejection', 'road traffic accident', 'drowsiness', 'headache', 'numbness', 'lost consciousness', 'collided', 'abnormality', 'frontal headache', 'confused', 'unable to recognize members of his family', 'unsteady gait', 'slurred speech', 'withdrawn', 'blank', 'grand mal convulsion', 'neurological disease', 'afebrile', 'focal neurological deficit', 'meningism', 'sharpening', 'spikes independently', 'epilepsy', 'low signal intensity', 'T1-weighted FLASH', 'lesions', 'small vessel ischemia', 'hypertension', 'partial epilepsy', 'fits', 'agitated', 'psychotic', 'visual hallucinations', 'focal neurology', 'obtunded', 'high open pressure', 'epileptics', 'frontal notched theta activity', 'improvement', 'tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity', 'improvement', 'recovered fully', 'seizure activity', 'neurological symptoms', 'continues to do well', 'lesions']","['tacrolimus', 'prednisolone', 'tacrolimus', 'methylprednisolone', 'Cellcept', 'lamotrigine', 'phenytoin', 'tacrolimus', 'Tacrolimus', 'cyclosporine', 'tacrolimus']","['42', 'July 2002', '2004']","['Renal biopsy', 'cadaver renal transplant', 'plasma creatinine', 'renal biopsy', 'creatinine', 'transplantation', 'Computed tomography (CT) scan of his head', 'simple analgesic', 'blood pressure', 'Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination', 'microscopy', 'Gram', 'Gram and Zeihl-Nielson stain', 'Zeihl-Nielson stain', 'cytology', 'virology', 'glucose', 'protein', 'cultures', 'India-ink for cryptococcus', 'Blood cultures', 'blood count', 'Chest and skull X-ray', 'Electroencephalogram (EEG)', 'magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain', 'renal function', 'Magnesium', 'cholesterol', 'tacrolimus level', 'Glasgow coma score', 'CT', 'MRI', 'Lumbar puncture', 'open pressure', 'protein', 'CSF', 'CSF analysis', 'EEG', 'antibiotic', 'antifungal agents', 'MRI scan']","['July 2002', 'Eight weeks', 'a month', 'three weeks later', 'next few days', 'in 2004']"

The patient was born in one of the small towns in the centre of Sudan. A midwife decided the sex as female at the time of birth. Thus, she was given a female name and raised as a female. The patient thinks of her self as a female and was very shy to tell if she was attracted to males or females, which could be due to her cultural background. On examination she was dressed in female dress, with complete absence of facial hair (Figure ), she was rather muscular, had broad shoulders with wide distance between the nipples, and absence of breasts or breast buds (Figure ). The patient was about 175 cm tall and had female voice. Examination of the external genitalia showed Type IV FGM (Figure ). There was neither pubic hair nor increased pigmentation in the genital area. Per rectum examination raised the suspicion of a prostate. Hormonal analysis revealed a serum prolactin level of 215 Mu/L, FSH of 0.5 Mu/L, and LH of 1.1 Mu/L (normal values: serum prolactin: 60–370 Mu/L, serum FSH: 1–8 Mu/L, serum LH: 2–10 Mu/L).
A peripheral blood sample of the patient was subjected to short-term culture in RPMI 1640 medium for three days, treated with Colcemide and hypotonic solution, and then fixed with methanol and acetic acid according to standard procedures. The harvested cells were dropped on clean slides and stained with Wright's stain, for chromosome banding []. The clonality criteria and the karyotypic descriptions were according to the ISCN (1995) recommendations [].

He had been diagnosed to have cutaneous malignant melanoma 11 years previously. An oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD) revealed a 5 cm diameter ulcer on the anterior wall of the stomach (Figure ). There was no active bleeding, but this was felt to be the cause of his anaemia since a Computerised Tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed no other gastrointestinal abnormality. Biopsies from the ulcer confirmed metastatic melanoma. As he was requiring repeated blood transfusions and physically fit he was offered minimally invasive resection of the stomach lesion.
Under general anaesthesia an OGD was performed to confirm the position of the tumour and to exclude other metastatic deposits. At laparoscopy the tumour was seen on the serosal aspect of the anterior gastric body. It was elevated using two prolene stay sutures and was resected with serial applications of an endoGIA45 stapler (Ethicon Endo-surgery Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA) to exclude the tumour (Figure ). The staple line was over sewn using a 3-0 polypropylene suture (Ethicon Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). The specimen was retrieved from the abdomen in a bag. At the end of the procedure the integrity of gastric staple line and completeness of resection were confirmed by OGD. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged home 48 hours after the operation. Histology of the specimen confirmed metastatic malignant melanoma measuring 35 mm in maximum dimension (Figure ). Histology also verified a complete excision with tumour free resection margins.

The patient was seronegative for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) prior to transplantation. His father's EBV and CMV status were unavailable. The transplant course was complicated by immediate postoperative acute renal artery thrombosis, which required transplant nephrectomy. He then received a deceased donor renal transplant 10 days later. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (Sandimmune formulation), azathioprine, and prednisone. He received 12 doses of Minnesota equine antilymphocyte immunoglobulin (MALG) for induction followed by 10 doses of murine anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) for two episodes of acute graft rejection over the 7 weeks following the transplant. The deceased donor's EBV and CMV status were unavailable from medical records. The patient developed acute infectious mononucleosis 2 months after transplantation demonstrated by positive EBV serology. He was treated with acyclovir and the infectious mononucleosis resolved.
At the age of 18, he presented with 5 months of fever, weight-loss and night sweats, and was found to have axillary adenopathy, splenomegaly and bulky right mediastinal adenopathy. A right anterior, thoracotomy and lymph node biopsy demonstrated Hodgkin's disease, nodular sclerosing subtype. Hodgkin's–Reed–Sternberg (HRS) cells were strongly positive for CD30 and EBV-latent membrane protein (LMP)-1. He was staged as Hodgkin's disease-IIIB. His EBV serology demonstrated elevated antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG titers and positive anti-VCA IgM, consistent with reactivation of EBV infection.
He was given six cycles of adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy, without significant side effects, and his Hodgkin's Disease went into remission. His serum creatinine after therapy was 2.3 mg/dl. Azathioprine was discontinued for leukopenia, and cyclosporine and prednisone continued until he developed renal insufficiency, with a serum creatinine of 7.8 mg/dl 5-years later. A biopsy showed severe chronic rejection. The patient was changed from Sandimmune to Neoral, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was added. Notably, his CMV IgG and IgM were positive at this time, indicating seroconversion in the preceding 2 years since his CMV status had last been determined. His renal function improved to his baseline serum creatinine of 2.4 mg/dl.
Four years later, serum creatinine was 3.2 mg/dl and a biopsy demonstrated chronic allograft nephropathy with moderate interstitial fibrosis. Neoral was changed to tacrolimus, and he continued on MMF and prednisone. His creatinine stabilized at a new baseline of 2.7 mg/dl.
Nine years after remission, the patient was found to have hypercalcemia of 15.4 mg/dl associated only with irritability. He was found to have retroaortic and retrocrural lymphadenopathy with mild paratracheal lymphadenopathy on Computed Tomography scan. Excisional biopsy showed Hodgkin's disease-IIIA of mixed cellularity subtype. The HRS cells were strongly positive for CD15, CD30, and EBV LMP-1. The patient's serology showed elevated anti-VCA IgM and anti-VCA IgG titers.
Tacrolimus and MMF were discontinued, and ABVD and valganciclovir commenced. He achieved remission of his recurrent HD with chemotherapy and immunosuppressive withdrawal. Adriamycin was subsequently changed to doxorubicin to prevent cardiotoxicity, and bleomycin was discontinued from his regimen secondary to lung toxicity. His chronic renal insufficiency worsened, and he returned to hemodialysis 9 months after diagnosis of recurrent Hodgkin's Disease.

Her past medical history was remarkable for smoking, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and prior myocardial infarction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an ascending aortic aneurysm with a maximum diameter of 6.6 cm. The descending aorta was dilated to 3.9 cm, but returned to a more normal diameter of 2.4 cm at the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus. No intimal flap was present to suggest dissection. Cardiac catheterization was performed by accessing the right femoral artery with a 6 F introducer sheath using a small skin incision followed by blunt dissection. The right coronary artery was 70% stenosed, the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis, and the left anterior descending artery was 50% stenosed. Moderate aortic insufficiency and a large ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 6.8 cm were noted. No dissection was seen.
The patient was brought to the operating room where after placing a right brachial arterial catheter, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced with etomidate and succinylcholine and maintained with fentanyl, midazolam, isoflurane, and pancuronium. An 8.5 Fr percutaneous introducer sheath was placed in the left subclavian vein and a Swan-Ganz catheter advanced into the pulmonary artery. Multiplane TEE was performed (Acuson CV70 and V5M probe, Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Malvern, PA) which confirmed the cardiac catheterization and MRI findings of ascending aortic aneurysm. No dissection was seen (Figures and ). Moderate aortic insufficiency and mild systolic dysfunction were noted. The patient was heparinized. Using a #15 scalpel blade, the left common femoral artery was exposed, incised, and then cannulated under direct vision using a 20 Fr femoral arterial cannula 25 cm in length (Fem-Flex Arterial Cannula, Edwards Life Science, Irvine, CA). Good blood return was noted from the cannula immediately after placement. A volume of 100 mL of crystalloid was then administered by the perfusionist to assess the adequacy of this line. The femoral line pressure was noted to be approximately 200 mmHg, higher than typical line pressures, but attributed to the relatively small cannula size. Venous cannulae were then placed in the superior and inferior vena cava. Cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated with a flow of 2.2 cardiac index (CI) and systemic blood pressure of 70 mmHg, with femoral line pressures near 200 mmHg. The patient was not hypertensive at any point in the pre-bypass stage.
Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was initiated and the aortic aneurysm incised and resected. A dissection flap within the aneurysm was noted, extending nearly to the level of the aortic annulus. A Dacron graft was then attached to the superior ascending aorta, and cardiopulmonary bypass re-initiated. Blood pressure was extremely low as measured by the brachial arterial catheter despite flow of 2.2 CI. The aorta was then fenestrated, restoring normal blood pressure. The inferior aspect of the graft was then anastamosed to the aortic annulus after buttressing the annulus with felt. Coronary artery bypass grafting was then performed. Cardiopulmonary bypass lasted 162 minutes, with a circulatory arrest time of 24 minutes.
Separation from bypass was achieved using epinephrine and calcium. TEE examination revealed a now competent aortic valve, but clearly demonstrated a large aortic dissection from the aortic arch down more than 20 cm into the thoracoabdominal aorta, extending pass the imaging depth of TEE. No entry site was visualized (Figures and ). The patient was hemodynamically stable, and was subsequently closed. Approximately 20 minutes after closure, the patient became profoundly hypotensive and the ventricles fibrillated. Aggressive resuscitation was provided with amiodarone, epinephrine, and electrical cardioversion while the chest was opened and bypass reinstituted. The incision was extended to expose the abdominal viscera which appeared hypoperfused. There was no resumption of cardiac function despite good flow on bypass, the patient was anuric and profoundly acidemic. Bypass was discontinued and the patient declared dead. Autopsy was declined.
Aortic dissection is a relatively rare intraoperative event, occurring in 0.16% of operations involving aortic cannulation and cardiopulmonary bypass []. Acute aortic dissection may also occur in a retrograde fashion when other vessels, such as the femoral, axillary, or carotid arteries are cannulated [-]. The incidence of retrograde dissection as a result of femoral arterial cannulation has been reported as 0.2–1.3%, and is likely caused by either direct (cannula) or indirect (jet) trauma to the vessel or atherosclerotic plaque [,]. Risk factors for dissection include hypertension, smoking, atherosclerosis, connective tissue disorders, and high cannula jet velocities. Aortic dissection is often lethal, but prompt diagnosis and treatment can result in improved survival. Femoral arterial cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass is standard practice for many aortic surgeries and may become even more common as minimally invasive cardiac surgeries proliferate. As a result, physicians should be aware of the risk of dissection in at-risk patient populations.
In our patient, we suspect that femoral cannulation led to an ilioaortic dissection which advanced retrograde up the length of the aorta as cardiopulmonary bypass was begun. Surgical exposure of the ascending aorta 30 minutes after initiation of bypass revealed the intimal flap, and then the extent of the dissection was evaluated by TEE. Immediate TEE examination of the descending aorta upon initiation of bypass would likely have shown the aortic dissection in evolution. This could have prompted cessation of flow into the femoral cannula and perhaps decreased the extent of the dissection. The management plan after chest closure was for either medical therapy or endovascular stent placement after the patient stabilized, however, an acute ischemic event likely was the cause of the patient's sudden cardiac death before definitive dissection therapy could be provided.
TEE is one of several highly sensitive and specific imaging modalities for assessment of aortic dissection. The sensitivity and specificity for TEE, computed axial tomography (CT), and MRI in one study was 100%/94%, 100%/100%, and 100%/94% respectively []. In contrast to CT, MRI, and aortography, TEE is mobile, rapid, and can be used intraoperatively. Color Doppler techniques also permit flow studies that can determine flow within true and false lumens and help delineate thrombosed lumens from those with active blood flow. Further, there is early evidence that TEE can be used to assess malperfusion or dissection of the arterial supply of the abdominal viscera []. This test is not perfect, however, as false-positive findings have been described with femoral arterial bypass cannulae in the setting of pseudodissection phenomenon. This is characterized by transient echogenic ""smoke"" and a pseudo false lumen in the descending aorta lasting about 30 seconds after initiation of bypass []. Additionally, TEE is unable to image the distal ascending aorta and proximal aortic arch well due to tracheal interposition. Overall accuracy for echocardiographic diagnosis of aortic dissection is very high and is comparable to other imaging modalities.","[[78.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['ascending aortic', 'coronary artery',

At admission she had palpable cervical lymph nodes. Chest x-ray showed an enlarged mediastinum. A laboratory screening showed a markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LD) of 32.2 μkat/L. The following day she developed the superior vena cava syndrome (VCS) with swelling of the upper extremities and the face. A CT scan confirmed tumor growth compressing the superior vena cava and bilateral pleural effusion. MRI of the spinal cord showed tumor infiltrates in all vertebrae, with epidural tumor growth extending from Th9 to L3. Fine-needle aspiration of a palpable lymph node revealed uncharacteristic largely dissociated medium-sized polygonal tumor cells with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and small paranuclear vacuoles. Flow cytometry of a bone marrow aspirate was negative for all hematopoietic markers including CD34. While awaiting definitive pathological diagnosis, the patient was treated with cyclophosphamide, 200 mg/m2/day for two days. Steroids and a caval stent alleviated VCS symptoms.
Sections of excised neck tumor displayed PAS-positive cytoplasmic glycogen, which was removed after pre-treatment with diastase. Cell nuclei were large with finely dispersed chromatin and prominent single nucleoli and the cells were loosely arranged in interwoven cords and small dissociated sheets. Initial positive immunostains for CD99 and FLI1 suggested a possibility of metastatic Ewing's sarcoma. Only a minor fraction (<5%) expressed cytokeratins using the MNF116 marker or AE1/AE3, CK5, and CK19 while CK7 and CK20 were negative. EMA was strongly expressed in all tumor cells (figure ). Immunostains for placental alkaline phosphatase, S-100, CD30, CD34, hematopoietic and common mesenchymal markers were negative. The tumor was regarded as a poorly differentiated glycogen-bearing carcinoma, and the possibility of a thymic origin (clear cell carcinoma) was entertained. However, based on the initial clinical and cytologic impression of possible metastatic Ewing's sarcoma, the patient was treated according to the Euro-E.W.I.N.G protocol, with the VIDE regimen (vincristine 1,5 mg/m2 day 1, ifosfamide 3 g/m2 day 1–3, doxorubicin 20 mg/m2 day 1–3, etoposide 150 mg/m2 day 1–3) q 3 w. Three weeks after the second cycle the patient was admitted due to swelling of the face and neck. CT-scan showed marked progression of mediastinal tumor which compressed vessels and bronchi (Figure ). Immediate radiation therapy to the mediastinum was begun, 30 Gy in 8 fractions. Weekly docetaxel 30 mg/m2 was given concomitantly, and continued after the radiation therapy, in total two cycles. Face and neck swelling improved, but three weeks after completing radiation therapy and 13 weeks after her first admission to hospital, the patient died suddenly of respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed no tumor remaining in the bone marrow and neck nodes, but a tiny focus remained near the VCS stent. Death was attributed to septicemia.
Cytogenetic analysis of the lymph node as well as bone marrow cells revealed a 46,XX,t(15;19)(q14-15;p13) as the sole clonal change (Figure ). FISH analyses regarding EWRS1-rearrangement (LSI EWSR1 Dual Color Break Apart Rearrangement Probe, Vysis/Abbott, Wiesbaden-Delkenheim, Germany) were negative in both lymph node and bone marrow samples. The t(15;19) was further characterized by metaphase FISH using probes for BRD4 and NUT. Two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, RP11-194H7 and RP11-637P24, covering the NUT (15q14) and BRD4 (19p13) loci, respectively, were selected from the UCSC Human Genome Browser [] and provided by the BACPAC Resources Center []. The BAC probes were labeled with Cy3-dUTP (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) or fluorescein (FITC)-dUTP (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and hybridized to metaphase spreads of the excised and cultured tumor tissue. The FISH treatments and analyses were performed as described []. Metaphase FISH analysis with the BAC clones RP11-194H7 and RP11-637P24 revealed that both of them were split by the 15;19-translocation. Simultaneous hybridization with RP11-194H7 and RP11-637P24 resulted in one green (15q14) and one red (19p13) signal on the corresponding homologues not involved in the translocation. A red-green (yellow) fusion signal was seen on der(15) and der(19), respectively (Figure ).
RT-PCR was carried out for the detection of the BRD4-NUT chimeric transcript. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Stockholm, Sweden), and 5 μg were reverse-transcribed in a 20 μL reaction volume containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3 (at 25°C), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM of each dNTP, 20 units RNA guard (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), 10 pmol random hexamers, and 400 units M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reaction was carried out at 37°C for 60 minutes, heated for 10 minutes at 65°C, and then kept at 4°C until analysis.
PCR amplification was performed using 1 μl of the cDNA as template in 50 μL reaction volume containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1 unit Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and 0.5 μM of each of the primers BR2276F: AAGTTGATGTGATTGCCGGCTCCTC and NUT1194R: GAGGTCTCTGGGCTTTACGCTGACG [] or BR2276F and NUT294R: CTGAAGGCATGATGGGCTGTGG. The PCR was run on a PCT-200 DNA Engine (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The cycling profile for the primer set BR2276F/NUT1194R included an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C, and 1 min at 72°C, and a final extension for 5 min at 72°C. The cycling profile for the primer set BR2276F/NUT294R was similar except that post-denaturation annealing-extension profiles were reduced to 30 sec. Fifteen microliters of the PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. The amplified cDNA fragments were purified using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and directly sequenced using the dideoxy procedure with an ABI Prism BigDye terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). RT-PCR with the the primer set BR2276F/NUT1194R amplified a 1158 bp cDNA fragment (Figure ). PCR with the primer set BR2276F/NUT294R generated a strong 255 bp fragment and two weakly amplified bands of 350 and 450 bp (Figure ). Direct sequencing of the 1158 and 255 bp fragments showed that nt 2380 of BRD4 (accession number AF386649) (figure ) was in-frame fused with nt 172 of NUT (accession number AF482429). This fusion was identical to that previously reported []. Sequence analysis of the 350 bp fragment showed an out-of-frame fusion of nt 2380 of BRD4 with nt 78 of NUT (Figure ).","[[30.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['back', 'cervical lymph nodes', 'Chest', 'mediastinum', 'superior vena cava', 'upper extremities', 'face', 'superior vena cava', 'bilateral pleural', 'spinal cord', 'all vertebrae', 'epidural', 'Th9 to L3', 'lymph node', 'bone marrow', 'caval', 'neck', 'placental', 'face', 'neck', 'mediastinal', 'vessels', 'bronchi', 'mediastinum', 'Face', 'neck', 'respiratory', 'bone marrow', 'neck nodes', 'lymph node', 'bone', 'bone marrow cells', 'lymph node', 'bone marrow', 'tumor tissue']","['back pain', 'weight loss', 'night sweats', 'palpable cervical lymph nodes', 'enlarged mediastinum', 'superior vena cava syndrome', 'VCS', 'swelling', 'tumor growth compressing', 'compressing', 'bilateral pleural effusion', 'tumor infiltrates', 'epidural tumor growth', 'polygonal tumor cells', 'clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm', 'paranuclear vacuoles', 'hematopoietic markers', 'CD34', 'VCS symptoms', 'neck tumor', 'PAS-positive cytoplasmic glycogen', 'Cell nuclei were large', 'dispersed chromatin', 'single nucleoli', 'cells were loosely arranged in interwoven cords', 'dissociated sheets', ""metastatic Ewing's sarcoma"", 'expressed cytokeratins', 'EMA was strongly expressed in all tumor cells', 'tumor', 'glycogen-bearing carcinoma', 'thymic origin', 'clear cell carcinoma', ""metastatic Ewing's sarcoma"", 'swelling', 'mediastinal tumor', 'swelling', 'died', 'respiratory failure', 'tumor', 'focus remained near the VCS stent', 'Death', 'septicemia', 'sole clonal change', 'EWRS1-rearrangement', 'LSI EWSR1 Dual Color Break Apart Rearrangement Probe', 'negative', 'metaphase spreads of the excised and cultured tumor tissue', 'split by the 15;19-translocation', 'Simultaneous hybridization', 'homologues', 'translocation', 'red-green (yellow) fusion signal', 'fusion', 'out-of-frame fusion']","['cyclophosphamide', 'vincristine', 'ifosfamide', 'doxorubicin', 'etoposide', 'docetaxel', 'Tris-HCl pH', 'KCl', 'MgCl2', 'DTT', 'dNTP', 'RNA guard', 'random hexamers', 'M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase', 'Invitrogen', 'Tris-HCl', 'pH 8.4', 'KCl', 'MgCl2', 'dNTP', 'Platinum Taq polymerase', 'Invitrogen', 'primers', 'AAGTTGATGTGATTGCCGGCTCCTC', 'GAGGTCTCTGGGCTTTACGCTGACG', 'CTGAAGGCATGATGGGCTGTGG', 'BR2276F', 'NUT294R', 'agarose', 'ethidium bromide']","['30', 'Abbott, Wiesbaden-Delkenheim', 'Germany', '194H7', 'UCSC', 'BACPAC Resources Center', 'Amersham', 'UK', 'Roche, Mannheim, Germany', 'RP11-194H7', 'Stockholm, Sweden', 'BR2276F', 'NUT1194R', 'Hilden', 'BR2276F', 'NUT1194R', 'BR2276F', 'AF386649', 'AF482429']","['Chest x-ray', 'laboratory screening', 'lactate dehydrogenase (LD)', 'CT scan', 'MRI of the spinal cord', 'Fine-needle aspiration of a palpable lymph node', 'Flow cytometry of a bone marrow aspirate', 'pathological diagnosis', 'Steroids', 'caval stent', 'Sections of excised neck tumor displayed PAS-positive cytoplasmic glycogen, which was removed', 'immunostains for CD99 and FLI1', 'MNF116 marker', 'AE1/AE3', 'CK5', 'CK19', 'CK7', 'CK20', 'Immunostains for placental alkaline phosphatase', 'S-100', 'CD30', 'CD34', 'hematopoietic', 'common mesenchymal markers', 'Euro-E.W.I.N.G protocol', 'VIDE regimen', 'CT-scan', 'radiation therapy', 'radiation therapy', 'radiation therapy', 'Autopsy', 'Cytogenetic analysis', 'Cytogenetic analysis of the lymph node as well as bone marrow cells', 'FISH', 'FISH analyses regarding EWRS1-rearrangement', 'metaphase FISH', 'metaphase FISH using probes for BRD4 and NUT', 'BRD4', 'NUT', 'BAC', 'NUT', 'BRD4', 'loci', 'cultured tumor', 'Metaphase FISH analysis', 'RT-PCR', 'Total RNA', 'reaction', 'PCR amplification', 'pH', 'PCR', 'cycling profile', 'cycling profile', 'post-denaturation annealing-extension profiles', 'Fifteen microliters of the PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels', 'amplified cDNA fragments', 'RT-PCR', 'PCR', 'Direct sequencing', 'Direct sequencing of the 1158 and 255 bp fragments', 'Sequence analysis of the 350 bp fragment', 'nt', 'BRD4', 'nt', 'NUT']",['one month']

She worked as a dental hygienist and lived with her husband and two children. She smoked 15 cigarettes a day and there was no previous history of venous thrombosis. She had a history of borderline thyrotoxicosis in the early 1990s and underwent tension-free vaginal tape treatment for stress incontinence in September 2003. She was on etonogestrel-releasing implants for contraception. She was very tender, locally, over the left side of the abdomen but rebound tenderness was absent. Rectal examination was unremarkable. Investigations showed haemoglobin of 13.2 g/dl, white cell count of 19.9 10*9/L, and platelets 214 10*9/L with neutrophilia. Amylase and renal function tests were found to be normal. Liver function tests were deranged with Gamma GT 244 u/l (twice normal). An abdominal Ultrasound Scan suggested a possible splenic infarction, which was confirmed by a CT scan of her abdomen. Tests were carried out to investigate the possibility of a post thrombotic state. Coagulation risk factors for thrombosis were within the normal limits; Protein S 67 %(60–140), Protein C 103 %(72–146), Antithrombin 3 110 %(80–120) and Activated P C Resistance was 1.9(2.0–4.3).

Thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed a well delimited round tumor, about 13 mm in diameter located in the LUL, with no mediastinal lymph-nodes enlargement (Figure ); brain and abdominal CT performed for staging did not find distant metasteses. Staging was then compleated with flexible endoscopy (the remnant esophagus, stomach and duodenum were normal), immunoscintigraphy with 99 mTc-labeled melanoma monoclonal, bone scan and broncoscopy which resulted all negative. Laboratory tests were unremarcable. Video-assisted lung wedge resection of the pulmonary nodule was carried out successfully. A definitive pathological diagnosis was achieved: the macroscopic examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the CT findings. The final histology confirmed proliferation of small spindle-shaped or stellate cells arranged in a spiral or fascicular structure, the tumor cells were intesively positive for immuno-reaction, using HMB45 anti-melanoma antibodies (Figure , ). These findings were compatible with the diagnosis of metastases of primary esophageal melanoma.

She was admitted to the hospital because of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. A diagnosis of biliary acute pancreatitis was established. Twenty days after admission, the patient's condition deteriorated. A new dynamic abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed an increase of peripancreatic fluid collections and necrosis of approximately 80% of the gland. A CT-guided fine needle biopsy yielded a positive culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and enterobacteriacea. The patient was treated empirically with piperacillin/tazobactam and received total parenteral nutrition via a subclavian central venous catheter. Surgical treatment consisted of cholecystectomy, sequestrectomy of necrotic pancreatic tissue, and extensive debridement. Antibiotic treatment was continued for 23 more days, although intravenous fluconazole was added and given for 14 days due to oropharyngeal candidiasis.
The clinical course was complicated by a new episode of abdominal pain and a second operation to drain large fluid collections of the retroperitoneal space was performed. Events during the immediate postoperative period were as follows: 1) treatment with meropenem and teicoplanin was started but fever reappeared, 2) ampicillin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, and Candida parapsilosis were documented on intraoperative and drainage cultures, 3) peripheral blood cultures were positive for C. parapsilosis, 4) a subclavian catheter was removed and another central venous catheter was inserted into a different site, and 5) culture of the subclavian catheter tip was also positive for C. parapsilosis. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for the C. parapsilosis isolate were as follows: flucytosine, 0.125 μg/mL; amphotericin B, 0.25 μg/mL; ketoconazole, 0.25 μg/mL; fluconazole, 4 μg/mL; and voriconazole, 0.06 μg/mL. On the 5th postoperative day, meropenem was discontinued and intravenous fluconazole, 400 mg/12 h, was initiated. The patient's clinical condition improved. Transthoracic echocardiograms performed 24 hours and 14 days after the onset of treatment with fluconazole were unrevealing. Eye funduscopy was repeatedly negative.
On the 17th postoperative day, the temperature rose to >38.5°C, the serum C reactive protein concentration increased (>200 mg/L), and peripheral blood cultures grew C. parapsilosis. Antifungal treatment with intravenous caspofungin was started (a 70-mg loading dose and then 50 mg daily). A transesophageal echocardiogram showed a mobile, echodense, filamentous image (35 × 10 mm) near the basal part of the interventricular septum, protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract (Figure ). Myocardial abscesses were not observed. Neither valve involvement nor other intracardiac lesions were observed. Using modified Duke clinical criteria, we diagnosed definite mural endocarditis on the basis of 2 major criteria (repeatedly positive blood cultures for C. parapsilosis and an echocardiogram finding positive for endocarditis). Heart surgery was not indicated due to the lack of valvular involvement and the patient's poor clinical condition related to severe pancreatitis, previous abdominal operations, renal dysfunction, and hemodynamic instability. The central venous catheter was replaced and culture of the tip was negative. However, 48 hours after the onset of treatment with caspofungin, serial blood cultures continued to yield C. parapsilosis. The serum creatinine clearance was 40 mL/min (normal range 60–120 mL/min) and because of the persistence of fungemia, 72 hours after starting caspofungin therapy, intravenous voriconazole at a dosage of 6 mg/kg/12 h followed by 4 mg/kg/12 h was added. Remarkably, the patient's clinical condition improved and fever subsided. Three days after the combined administration of caspofungin and voriconazole, a negative blood culture was obtained for the first time. Subsequent blood cultures were consistently negative. Serial follow-up transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiograms showed complete resolution of the fungal vegetation without significant aortic valve regurgitation. Treatment with caspofungin was maintained for 60 days. The patient was discharged on oral voriconazole (400 mg/day), which was given for 9 additional months. Oral voriconazole was well tolerated. In November 2005, 16 months after discharge from the hospital, she was asymptomatic without any evidence of infection.
This patient with C. parapsilosis mural endocarditis was cured by combined treatment with caspofungin and voriconazole. The outcomes for patients with fungal mural endocarditis have been extremely poor []. In the 7 cases of mural endocarditis caused by Candida spp. previously reported in the literature, 6 patients died after treatment with amphotericin B [-] and the only survivor was treated with combined azole therapy (alternating miconazole and fluconazole) and excision of the two mobile pedunculated masses in the right ventricle []. These patients had a mean age of 31 years. Risk factors for mural endocarditis included acute myelocytic leukemia in 5 patients, immunosuppressive treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus in 1, and major abdominal surgery with total parenteral nutrition in 1. The lesion was located in the right ventricle in 6 patients and in the left ventricle in the remaining case. Microbiologic investigation yielded Candida albicans in 2 cases, and C. parapsilosis, Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis in one case each; in 2 patients, the species of Candida was not identified. Prolonged use of central venous catheter was probably the implicated cause of hematogenous candidiasis and seeding of the endocardium. Intracardiac catheters can produce endothelial damage and predispose usually right-sided endocarditis. The mechanism of direct traumatization of the endocardium by the catheter makes central venous catheter-induced endocarditis bear pathophysiologic similarity to the experimental model of endocarditis in animals []. In our patient, the central venous catheter was located in the upper vena cava and mural endocarditis was in the left ventricle. Infections with C. parapsilosis are more frequently the cause of catheter-related infections than all other Candida species combined []. On the other hand, the role of C. parapsilosis as a nosocomial pathogen associated with invasive devices and parenteral nutrition has been emphasized []. Characteristics of C. parapsilosis that may relate to its increasing occurrence in nosocomial settings include frequent colonization of the subungual space and an ability to proliferate in glucose-containing solutions, with a resultant increase in adherence to synthetic materials.
Our patient was not medically fit for heart surgery and was successfully treated with 8 weeks of intravenous caspofungin, although voriconazole was added due to persistence of positive blood cultures. Caspofungin has MICs somewhat higher for C. parapsilosis and C. guilliermondii, although the clinical significance is unclear []. This might explain the persistence of positive blood cultures 48 hours after the beginning of treatment with caspofungin. Ten previous cases of Candida endocarditis treated with caspofungin have been reported [,], four of which cured without cardiac surgery [-].
In our patient, combination therapy with caspofungin and voriconazole was an alternative to caspofungin monotherapy because of the persistence of positive blood cultures and the presence of renal insufficiency. On the other hand, continued fungemia at 3 days after the onset of caspofungin therapy cannot be considered that caspofungin was a failure, but given the known effect of grater MIC for C. parapsilosis, voriconazole was added without waiting for a possible resolution of candidemia. Voriconazole is a new triazole antifungal, while caspofungin is the first echinocandin antifungal. Voriconazole acts by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. Caspofungin inhibits beta-1,3-D-glucan synthesis in the cell wall, a target present in fungal cells, and has shown excellent activity against Candida biofilm [] as opposed to poor penetration of voriconazole [,]. Both agents are broad-spectrum, with efficacy against invasive Aspergillus and Candida infections. The efficacy of the antifungal combination therapy with caspofungin and voriconazole has been documented in a few case reports of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematologic malignancies [,] and in a small series of patients with endogenous Candida endophthalmitis []. To our knowledge, the present report is the first description of successful treatment of C. parapsilosis mural endocarditis with caspofungin and voriconazole. Although relapsing endocarditis seems unlikely, the patient has been followed for less than 2 years and late relapse is still possible.","[[59.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['abdominal', 'biliary',

368,1459115-1,16643646,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1459115.xml,The prolongation of somatic support in a pregnant woman with brain-death: a case report,"A 40 year old woman was admitted to the obstetrics ward during the 25th week of gestation to adjust her anticoagulation regimen. She was gravida 2, with one previous miscarriage and had a metallic mitral valve prosthesis as a result of a childhood episode of rheumatic fever. Except for her cardiac disease, which was under control, she led a normal life and was employed as a social worker. This woman discovered that she was pregnant in the first trimester of gestation, and without consulting her physician, stopped using her anticoagulants. She was late in initiating antenatal care and consequently her referral to a specialized antenatal clinic was also delayed. When she was in the 25th week of gestation, she reached the third level of care and was admitted to the obstetrics ward where she was prescribed 10,000 units of unfractionated heparin twice a day. During her third night in the hospital, after receiving subcutaneous heparin for almost 72 hours (at that time the dose had been increased to 12,000 units twice a day), she developed headache, nausea, vomiting and mental confusion. At that time, physical examination revealed a stiff neck, but no focal neurological deficits were noted. The patient's pupils showed isocoria and were reactive to light, and she had a Glasgow coma score of 11. During this initial phase of hospitalization, her blood pressure and pulse remained within the normal range. APTT (Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time) was 57 seconds. A computerized tomography scan displayed an intraparenchymatous haematoma with bloody obliteration of the ventricles. The patient underwent neurosurgical drainage of this lesion and was admitted to the obstetrical intensive care unit, where postoperative care and ventilatory support was continued. During the following hours, her neurological status deteriorated progressively and on the following day, the patient appeared to have gone into a non-reactive coma with no sign of brainstem activity. Maternal brain death was confirmed by a transcranial Doppler scan of the cerebral arteries. At that time, foetal weight was estimated at 660 g according to ultrasound evaluation. After the diagnosis of brain death, the situation was explained to the woman's family, who informed the medical team that the deceased woman had legally registered her desire to posthumously donate her organs. In view of the deceased woman's wishes and the status of the foetus, a conservative approach was adopted by the medical team, and the necessary measures to prolong maternal homeostasis were implemented.
We assumed that brain death would have resulted in a condition of panhypopituitarism caused by loss of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis function. Accordingly, enteral replacement of thyroid hormone and cortisol (prednisone) was carried out. The patient also developed a persistent state of hyperglycemia that was treated with continuous intravenous insulin. Diabetes Insipidus was treated with enteric desmopressin (DDAVP), and diuresis and serum sodium were used to titrate the dose of DDAVP.
The patient developed mild hypotension, which was initially treated with crystalloid and colloid replacement to maintain central venous pressure between 14 and 18 centimetres of water, plus low doses of norepinephrine. A moderate but persistent bradycardia was initially treated with dopamine and later with low doses of epinephrine. Pressure-limited mechanical ventilation was used to manage mild respiratory alkalosis (CO2 = 32 mmHg) and an arterial oxygen saturation greater than 94%.
Basal energy expenditure (BEE) was calculated using the Harris-Benedict formula (BEE = 655 + [9.6 × weight(kg)] + [1.8 × height(cm)] - [4.7 × age(yr)]), multiplied by 1.25 (stress factor for pregnancy), adding 300 Kcal for a single foetus and deducting 15% from the BEE to compensate for the reduction in metabolism associated with the state of brain death []. Enteral nutrition was used to provide the total daily calorie requirement.
Hypothermia was a major feature during this period and was treated with passive heating using an air heater and blankets to maintain temperature > 36°C. After ten days of somatic support, the patient developed ventilation-associated pneumonia, which was treated with ceftriaxone, and a tracheotomy was performed to facilitate bronchial hygiene and mechanical ventilation.
Foetal well-being was thoroughly evaluated by electronic foetal heart rate monitoring, foetal Doppler velocimetry and biophysical profile. Betamethasone was used to accelerate foetal lung maturity. During a total of twenty-five days of prolongation, the maternal organism remained mostly stable. Nevertheless, in the last week of prolongation progressive oligohydramnios was detected in the foetus and a Doppler test revealed centralization (brain sparring). Foetal status helped in reaching the decision to perform a Caesarean section at that moment. It is possible that, even at the low doses used, the vasoconstrictors may have contributed to the functional placental insufficiency by constricting the uterine vessels, resulting in placental hypoperfusion. A male infant was born weighting 815 g, with an Apgar score of 9 and 10 in the first and fifth minutes, respectively. Following delivery, the premature newborn was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. He required no mechanical ventilation and had no major complications. Some hours after delivery, the maternal organs were removed for donation. The baby was discharged from hospital weighing 1850 g at 40 days of life. Re-evaluation of the infant during a follow-up visit at 90 days of life revealed normal development and no detectable sequelae.","[[40.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['mitral valve', 'cardiac', 'neck', 'neurological', 'pupils', 'intraparenchymatous', 'ventricles', 'neurological', 'brainstem', 'brain', 'transcranial', 'cerebral arteries', 'foetal', 'brain', 'brain', 'hypothalamic-pituitary axis', 'central venous', 'respiratory', 'arterial', 'brain', 'bronchial', 'Foetal', 'heart', 'foetal', 'foetal lung', 'foetus', 'brain', 'placental', 'uterine vessels', 'placental', 'maternal organs']","['gestation', 'gravida 2', 'miscarriage', 'rheumatic fever', 'cardiac disease', 'normal life', 'pregnant', 'gestation', 'headache', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'mental confusion', 'stiff neck', 'focal neurological deficits', 'isocoria', 'reactive to light', 'intraparenchymatous haematoma', 'bloody obliteration of the ventricles', 'lesion', 'neurological status deteriorated', 'non-reactive coma', 'brainstem activity', 'Maternal brain death', 'brain death', 'deceased', 'deceased', 'brain death', 'panhypopituitarism', 'loss of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis function', 'hyperglycemia', 'Diabetes Insipidus', 'hypotension', 'bradycardia', 'respiratory alkalosis', 'pregnancy', 'reduction in metabolism', 'brain death', 'Hypothermia', 'pneumonia', 'Foetal well-being', 'prolongation', 'maternal organism', 'prolongation', 'oligohydramnios', 'centralization', 'brain sparring', 'placental insufficiency', 'constricting the uterine vessels', 'placental hypoperfusion', 'delivery', 'premature newborn', 'complications', 'delivery', 'normal development', 'detectable sequelae']","['heparin', 'heparin', 'prednisone', 'insulin', 'enteric desmopressin', 'DDAVP', 'DDAVP', 'norepinephrine', 'dopamine', 'epinephrine', 'ceftriaxone', 'Betamethasone']","['40', 'obstetrics ward', '25th', 'social worker', '25th', 'obstetrics ward', 'obstetrical intensive care unit', 'neonatal intensive care unit']","['anticoagulation regimen', 'metallic mitral valve prosthesis', 'anticoagulants', 'antenatal care', 'physical examination', 'Glasgow coma score', 'blood pressure', 'pulse', 'APTT', 'computerized tomography scan', 'neurosurgical drainage of this lesion', 'postoperative care', 'ventilatory support', 'transcranial Doppler scan of the cerebral arteries', 'foetal weight', 'ultrasound', 'maternal homeostasis', 'enteral replacement of thyroid hormone and cortisol', 'diuresis', 'serum sodium', 'crystalloid and colloid replacement', 'central venous pressure', 'mechanical ventilation', 'CO2', 'arterial oxygen saturation', 'Basal energy expenditure', 'BEE', 'BEE', 'weight', 'height', 'BEE', 'Enteral nutrition', 'passive heating', 'passive heating using an air heater and blankets', 'temperature', 'somatic support', 'tracheotomy', 'mechanical ventilation', 'electronic foetal heart rate monitoring', 'foetal Doppler velocimetry', 'biophysical profile', 'Doppler test', 'Caesarean section', 'vasoconstrictors', 'weighting', 'Apgar score', 'mechanical ventilation', 'maternal organs were removed', 'maternal organs were removed for donation', 'weighing']","['25th week', 'first trimester of gestation', '25th week', 'at that time', 'At that time', 'last week', 'last week']"

He complained of left sided chest pain and worsening shortness of breath and dizziness. On examination, HR was 155/min, RR 37/min, BP 99/66 mm Hg, and JVP 5 cms above sternal angle. 5th and 6th ribs were tender but there was no obvious crepitus. Breath sounds were diminished in the left base. Chest x-ray revealed fractures of 5th and 6th ribs, a large left hemothorax and enlarged cardiac silhouette (Fig ). An intercostal drain was inserted which drained 1 lit of fresh blood but a follow up chest x-ray continued to show a large cardiac shadow (Fig ). A CT scan of chest revealed a 2 cm hemopericardium (2a) and residual left pleural blood and clot (Fig ). He was transferred to our regional cardiothoracic centre for further management. A transthoracic echocardiogram on arrival confirmed a global pericardial effusion with early tamponade.
Patient was urgently taken to the operation theatre and a median sternotomy performed with bypass standby. The pericardium was tense. It was widely opened and 250 mls of old blood evacuated. There was a 1.5 cm non bleeding superficial left ventricular laceration posterolateral to the apex within a large area of contused left ventricle with a bleeding superficial vein. There was a corresponding 1 cm tear of the pericardium posterior to the phrenic nerve. Left pleura was widely opened and lung inspected. There was a non bleeding laceration of the superior segment of the lingula and about 500 mls of residual clot and blood in the pleural cavity. There were fractures of 5th and 6th ribs with wide displacement of the two segments of the fractured 5th rib. The sharp jagged posterior end of the fractured rib had been displaced medially inside the pleural cavity and had lacerated the lingula and punctured the pericardium and the left ventricle.
The sharp end of the fractured rib was excised, the bleeding ventricular vein was diathermised, the left ventricular contusion and nonbleeding laceration as well as the lingular tear were covered with a generous application of Tissel glue (Baxter biosurgery) and the pleural cavity was evacuated of clot and blood.

370,1459159-1,16643656,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1459159.xml,Primary mediastinal hemangiopericytoma,"A 72-year-old woman was referred to our institution complaining of dyspnea, cough and chest tightness for the last two months. Physical examination indicated tachypnea, orthopnea and use of accessory respiratory muscles. Laboratory studies were essentially within normal limits. A chest X-ray revealed a homogenous opacity occupying lower two-thirds of the left hemithorax and causing contralateral shifting of the mediastinum and heart (Figure ). Thoracentesis was performed in order to palliate respiratory problems. One thousand eight hundred (1800) ml of serosanguinous fluid were aspirated. Cytologic examination revealed an exudate with no signs of malignancy. Culture of the aspirated pleural fluid was also negative. A computed tomographic scan (CT) of the chest revealed a large solid tumorous mass measuring 7.3 × 2.3 cm located in the posterosuperior mediastinum on the left side associated with pleural effusion (Figure ). In order to perform preoperative staging of the tumor, the patient underwent CT scans of brain, upper abdomen, a bone scan and broncoscopy. All were normal. The tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 19-9, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen were within normal limits. The mass seemed to be resectable and surgical approach was suggested to the patient.
The patient underwent left posterolateral thoracotomy through 5th intercostal space. During the operation, the mass appeared to have mediastinal origin and was highly vascularized. There was no involvement of vital mediastinal structures and the surrounding lung parenchyma was compressed by the tumor. Six hundred ml of sanguinous pleural fluid were aspirated. Despite the persistent bleeding during dissection the tumor was resected. The mass measured 7 × 3 × 2.5 cm and weighed 210 g. Grossly the resected specimen was a smooth, friable encapsulated mass with focal hemorrhages. The cut surface was smooth, elastic and pale brown. Microscopic examination showed round and spindle cells surrounded by thin-walled, endothelium-lined vascular channels, giving a ""staghorn"" appearance to the vessels as typically seen in hemangiopericytoma (Figure ). The low-mitotic activity and the absence of clear nuclear pleomorphism were suggestive of a low-grade malignant tumor.

Case report and review of the literature of the use of remnant stomach,"A 60-year-old white male was admitted to our Department in January 2003 because of dysphagia and odinophagia. The patient's medical history included perforated benign gastric ulcer treated in 1965 by means of distal gastrectomy and ante colic end to side gastrojejejunostomy (Polya anastomosis). An esophagoscopy confirmed an ulcerated tumour of the lower third esophagus with the upper margin located at 35 cm from dental arcade; a squamous cell carcinoma was identified on biopsies. The interval between previous distal gastrectomy and esophagectomy was 38 years. Barium meal showed a capacious residual stomach with efficient emptying function through a wide gastrojejunostomy. The size of the residual stomach was measured before operation with contrast barium meal x-ray: 8 cm in length at the lesser curvature and 11 cm at the transection of the body (Figure ). Because of no evidence of metastatic disease and satisfactory general health conditions the patient was scheduled for resection of the oesophageal cancer.
Two-phase subtotal esophagectomy via abdominal (bilateral subcostal incision) associated with 5th right thoracotomy with two field lymph node dissection was carried out. In the right upper abdomen the duodenum stump, transverse colon, and lower surface of the liver were tightly adherent. Exploration of the thorax and abdomen excluded presence of distant metastases and confirmed wide gastrojejunal anastomosis. The right gastroepiploic arcade was divided at the time of previous gastrectomy. The residual stomach, afferent and efferent loops of jejunum were fully mobilized from peripheral cohesions. Short gastric vessels were not preserved and the left gastric artery was divided; no jejunal vessel was sacrified. The afferent loop was transected very close to the gastrojejunal anastomosis and the gastric end was closed. The other end was covered with gauze and closed. The prepared stomach roll was pulled up in continuity with the efferent loop through the posterior mediastinal route into the right emithorax. The upper end of the oesophagus was resected 5 cm above the tumour. The specimen was removed after careful sleeve resection of the lesser curve. Proximal and distal resection margins were tested by frozen-section histology assessment. The remnant stomach appeared rosy with adequate bloody supply probably by the efferent jejunal flap with its wide gastrojejunal anastomosis (this was checked by transilluminating the mesenteric vessels). The esophagus was anastomosed mechanically with a circular stapler by an anterior gastrotomy to the high point of the remnant stomach (fundus) at the level of the azygos arcade. No micro vascular anastomosis was performed. At the end there was absence of tension in the anastomosis (Figure ). The afferent loop was rejoined to the efferent loop at about 60 cm below the original gastrojejunostomy by Roux-en-Y method (Figure ). A feeding jejejunostomy was made and the abdominal incision was sutured.
Pathological examination revealed a squamous cell tumour of 23 mm in diameter pT3, pN0, M0, R0, G2 (Stage IIA). None coexisting neoplastic lesion was found in the resected esophagus. Evidence of areas of mild dysplasia and esophagitis of the noncancerous esophageal mucosa surrounding the cancer lesion and at the esophagogastric junction was randomly observed. None of the 15 lymph nodes dissected were involved. Postoperative course was uneventful. On follow-up, two years after operation, the patient was alive without evidence of recurrence. The patient had an improved intake of food, mainly managing a semi-solid diet with an average intake per meal was 400–500 mL. Endoscopy findings, barium meal contrast exam and angio-CT scan confirmed good vascularity of the jejunal flap and stomach.","[[60.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['gastric', 'lower third esophagus', 'upper margin located at 35 cm from dental arcade', 'stomach', 'stomach', 'lesser curvature', 'transection of the body', 'oesophageal', 'abdominal', 'bilateral subcostal', 'subcostal', 'lymph node', 'right upper abdomen', 'duodenum stump', 'transverse colon', 'lower surface of the liver', 'thorax', 'abdomen', 'gastrojejunal', 'right gastroepiploic', 'right gastroepiploic arcade', 'residual stomach', 'afferent and efferent loops of jejunum', 'Short gastric vessels', 'left gastric artery', 'jejunal vessel', 'afferent loop', 'gastrojejunal anastomosis', 'stomach', 'posterior mediastinal route', 'right emithorax', 'upper end of the oesophagus', '5 cm above the tumour', 'lesser curve', 'resection margins', 'remnant stomach', 'efferent jejunal flap', 'gastrojejunal', 'mesenteric vessels', 'esophagus', 'high point of the remnant stomach (fundus) at the level of the azygos arcade', 'micro vascular', 'anastomosis', 'afferent loop', 'efferent loop at about 60 cm below the original gastrojejunostomy', 'abdominal', 'esophagus', 'esophageal mucosa', 'esophagogastric junction', '15 lymph nodes', 'jejunal flap', 'stomach']","['dysphagia', 'odinophagia', 'benign gastric ulcer', 'ulcerated tumour of the lower third esophagus', 'tumour', 'squamous cell carcinoma', 'capacious residual stomach', 'efficient emptying function through a wide gastrojejunostomy', 'size of the residual stomach', 'metastatic disease', 'satisfactory general health conditions', 'oesophageal cancer', 'tightly adherent', 'distant metastases', 'metastases', 'wide gastrojejunal anastomosis', 'right gastroepiploic arcade was divided', 'fully mobilized', 'peripheral cohesions', 'Short gastric vessels were not preserved', 'left gastric artery was divided', 'sacrified', 'rosy', 'bloody supply', 'wide gastrojejunal anastomosis', 'absence of tension in the anastomosis', 'tension', 'squamous cell tumour', 'neoplastic lesion', 'dysplasia', 'esophagitis', 'noncancerous esophageal mucosa', 'cancer lesion', 'Postoperative course was uneventful', 'alive', 'recurrence', 'improved intake of food', 'good vascularity']",[],"['60', 'January 2003', '1965']","['distal gastrectomy', 'ante colic end to side gastrojejejunostomy', 'gastrojejejunostomy', 'Polya anastomosis', 'esophagoscopy', 'biopsies', 'distal gastrectomy', 'gastrectomy', 'esophagectomy', 'Barium meal', 'contrast barium meal x-ray', 'resection of the oesophageal cancer', 'Two-phase subtotal esophagectomy via abdominal (bilateral subcostal incision) associated with 5th right thoracotomy with two field lymph node dissection', '5th right thoracotomy', 'two field lymph node dissection', 'Exploration of the thorax and abdomen', 'gastrectomy', 'afferent loop was transected very close to the gastrojejunal anastomosis', 'gastric end was closed', 'other end was covered with gauze and closed', 'stomach roll was pulled up in continuity with the efferent loop through the posterior mediastinal route into the right emithorax', 'upper end of the oesophagus was resected 5 cm above the tumour', 'specimen was removed after careful sleeve resection of the lesser curve', 'frozen-section histology assessment', 'esophagus was anastomosed mechanically with a circular stapler by an anterior gastrotomy to the high point of the remnant stomach (fundus) at the level of the azygos arcade', 'afferent loop was rejoined to the efferent loop at about 60 cm below the original gastrojejunostomy by Roux-en-Y method', 'feeding jejejunostomy was made', 'abdominal incision was sutured', 'Pathological examination', 'resected esophagus', '15 lymph nodes dissected', 'semi-solid diet', 'Endoscopy', 'barium meal contrast exam', 'angio-CT scan']","['38 years', '38 years', 'at the time', 'two years']"

His functional capacity was New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III. He had no family history of HC. The fourth heart sound and moderate systolic murmur in mitral area radiating to mid-clavicular line were heard at cardiac auscultation. On electrocardiogram, sinus rhythm, left axis deviation and repolarization abnormalities (negative T vawes) were seen. Chest X-ray showed neither cardiomegaly nor pulmonary congestion. Echocardiographic examination was done to assess the LV anatomy and revealed normal dimensions of the LV at end-diastole (41 mm) and end-systole (19 mm), SAM of the mitral valve with moderate mitral regurgitation, left atrial dilatation (55 mm) and hypertrophic interventricular septum (mid:25 mm, basal:27 mm). LV ejection fraction was 75%. Continuous-wave Doppler measurements showed a peak systolic resting gradient of 46 mmHg, with an increase to 96 mmHg at Valsalva's maneouvre at the LV outflow (Figure ). Coronary angiography and invasive hemodynamic assessment were done. Coronary angiograms showed no narrowing of major epicardial coronary arteries. The left ventriculography showed a hyperkinetic contraction pattern at the mid-ventricle with a narrow muscular tunnel between the LV apical and bazal cavities (Figure ). Hemodynamic assessment revealed a significant intra-ventricular pressure gradient of 56 mmHg (LV apex 178/10 mmHg, LV outflow 122/12 mmHg) with mild LV outflow tract pressure gradient of 30 mmHg (aorta 92/64) (Figure ). We finally diagnosed MVOHC associated with SAM of the mitral valve and obstruction at both the mid-ventricular and outflow levels.
The patient was informed about the therapeutic options and gave her written consent to percutaneous septal myocardial ablation. The first septal branch was dominant (diameter: 2.1 mm) and showed prominent septal myocardial distribution (Figure ). The distance between the left anterior descending coronary artery ostium and the origin of the first septal branch was 24.4 mm. Other distal septal branches were very small. It was considered that the first septal branch ablation may be effective in decreasing the intraventricular pressure gradient. The procedure was performed as described elsewhere []. The floppy wire (Choice scimed guide wire, 0.014"", 300 cm, Boston Scientific, Miami, USA) was crossed to first septal branch which estimated target vessel. A 2.5 × 20 mm over the wire balloon (Maverick OTW PTCA dilatation catheter, Boston Scientific, Maple Grove, USA) was placed in the proximal part of the vessel. The echo contrast agent (Echovist, Schering) was administered selectively in the estimated vessel under simultaneous color Doppler echocardiography. Prior to alcohol injection, balloon position was verified by myocardial contrast echocardiography (Figure ). When the balloon was inflated and transient occlusion constituted, hemodynamic measurements were repeated. After that demonstrating the significant reduction in intra-ventricular pressure gradient, the vessel was occluded by injection of 3 cc absolute alcohol in portions of 1 cc/min. (Figure ). Repeated hemodynamic measurements found a decrease of the post-extrasystolic gradient to 18 mmHg at the mid-ventricular level with no resting gradient in the LV outflow level (Figure ). Patient had slight chest pain during the procedure. Complications such as conduction abnormality were not seen. The post-procedural electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevation (maximal 6 mm) in V1–2 with reciprocal ST segment depression in II, III and aVF. Maximal creatine kinase rise was 1591 U/l with a MB fraction of 347 U/l. The size of the caused infarction was estimated by areas under the CPK-MB versus time graph's curve. SAS 9.1 statistical software was used to calculate area under the curve. Area under the curve was 5070 U/L hour for CPK-MB (Figure ).
The post-procedural echocardiographic examination was done before the discharge and showed reductions of left atrial dimension to 46 mm and interventricular septum thickness to 20 mm with septal hypokinesia and mild mitral regurgitation without SAM of the mitral valve. LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters were 49 mm, 32 mm respectively. Continuous-wave Doppler measurements showed 21 mmHg a peak systolic resting gradient, with an increase to 36 mmHg at Valsalva's maneouvre (Figure ). The patient was discharged after an uneventful hospital stay of 5 days. Medication with 100 mg metoprolol was continued at discharge.
At 6 months' follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and her functional capacity was improved (NYHA class I). Physical examination showed mild systolic murmur in mitral area. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, left axis and no Q wave in V1–2 (Figure ). The control echocardiographic examination showed reduction of interventricular septum thickness (mid:18 mm, basal:16 mm, Figure ) and mild mitral regurgitation without SAM of the mitral valve. LV ejection fraction was 67%. Continuous-wave Doppler measurements showed 18 mmHg peak systolic resting gradient, with an increase to 31 mmHg at Valsalva's maneouvre (Figure ).","[[34.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['chest', 'Heart', 'heart', 'mitral area', 'mid-clavicular line', 'cardiac auscultation', 'Chest', 'pulmonary', 'LV', 'LV', 'mitral valve', 'mitral', 'left atrial', 'interventricular septum', 'LV', ""Valsalva's maneouvre at the LV outflow"", 'Coronary', 'Coronary', 'major epicardial coronary arteries', 'muscular tunnel', 'LV apical', 'bazal cavities', 'LV apex', 'LV', 'LV outflow', 'LV outflow tract', 'aorta', 'mitral valve', 'both the mid-ventricular and outflow levels', 'first septal branch', 'septal myocardial', 'left anterior descending coronary artery ostium', 'origin of the first septal branch', 'distal septal branches', 'first septal branch', 'intraventricular', 'first septal branch', 'vessel', 'estimated vessel', 'vessel', 'myocardial', 'intra-ventricular', 'vessel', 'LV outflow level', 'chest', 'II, III', 'aVF', 'left atrial', 'interventricular septum', 'septal', 'mitral', 'mitral valve', 'LV', 'mitral area', 'interventricular septum', 'mitral', 'mitral valve', 'LV']","['HC', 'palpitation', 'chest pain', 'dyspnea', 'functional capacity', 'HC.', 'fourth heart sound', 'systolic murmur', 'sinus rhythm', 'left axis deviation', 'repolarization abnormalities', 'T vawes', 'cardiomegaly', 'pulmonary congestion', 'normal dimensions of the LV', 'SAM of the mitral valve', 'mitral regurgitation', 'left atrial dilatation', 'hypertrophic interventricular septum', 'narrowing of major epicardial coronary arteries', 'hyperkinetic contraction pattern', 'narrow muscular tunnel', 'LV apex 178/10 mmHg', 'LV outflow tract pressure gradient', 'MVOHC', 'SAM of the mitral valve', 'obstruction', 'dominant', 'septal myocardial distribution', 'distance between the left anterior descending coronary artery ostium and the origin of the first septal branch', 'small', 'transient occlusion', 'reduction in intra-ventricular pressure gradient', 'vessel was occluded', 'decrease of the post-extrasystolic gradient', 'resting gradient', 'chest pain', 'Complications', 'conduction abnormality', 'ST segment elevation', 'reciprocal ST segment depression', 'infarction', 'reductions of left atrial dimension', 'interventricular septum thickness', 'septal hypokinesia', 'mitral regurgitation', 'SAM of the mitral valve', 'asymptomatic', 'functional capacity was improved', 'systolic murmur', 'sinus rhythm', 'left axis', 'Q wave', 'Q wave in V1–2', 'reduction of interventricular septum thickness', 'mitral regurgitation', 'SAM of the mitral valve']","['metoprolol', 'Echovist', 'metoprolol']","['34', 'Maple Grove']","['medication', 'electrocardiogram', 'T vawes', 'Chest X-ray', 'Echocardiographic examination', 'LV ejection fraction', 'Continuous-wave Doppler measurements', 'peak systolic resting gradient', 'Coronary angiography', 'invasive hemodynamic assessment', 'Coronary angiograms', 'left ventriculography', 'Hemodynamic assessment', 'intra-ventricular pressure gradient', 'LV outflow', 'percutaneous septal myocardial ablation', 'first septal branch ablation', 'procedure', 'floppy wire (Choice scimed guide wire, 0.014"", 300 cm, Boston Scientific, Miami, USA) was crossed to first septal branch which estimated target vessel', 'color Doppler echocardiography', 'alcohol injection', 'myocardial contrast echocardiography', 'balloon was inflated', 'hemodynamic measurements', 'hemodynamic measurements', 'electrocardiogram', 'Maximal creatine kinase rise', 'MB fraction', 'CPK-MB', 'Area under the curve', 'CPK-MB', 'echocardiographic examination', 'LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters', 'Continuous-wave Doppler measurements', 'peak systolic resting gradient', 'Medication', 'Physical examination', 'electrocardiogram', 'echocardiographic examination', 'LV ejection fraction', 'Continuous-wave Doppler measurements', 'peak systolic resting gradient']","['6 years ago', 'post-procedural', 'post-procedural']"

He was readmitted 4 months later with fever, intermittently painful and pulsatile swelling over the upper third of the sternum that appeared over a period of 15 days and had gradually increased in size to attain its present size of 6 × 4 cm (Fig. ).
A preoperative TEE showed a pseudoaneurysm with high flow velocity inside, developed between the prosthesis and the posterior surface of the sternum.
Moderate hypothermic bypass was instituted with cannulation of right axillary artery for antegrade cerebral perfusion and femoral artery with Estech® cannula for aorta endoclamping and perfusion of lower body districts [] (Fig. ). The chest was opened through the previous scar reducing the CPB flows and obtaining digital control over the defect on the aorta. Subsequently a vent cannula has been placed in the right superior pulmonary vein to decompress the left side of the heart. The extrathoracic component of the pseudoaneurysm was opened and the clots evacuated. Adhesions over the right ventricle were taken down, and both pleura were opened. Clots in front of the aorta were evacuated to reveal one main defect at the previous aortotomy site measuring 2 × 2 cm (Fig. ). The bioprosthesis was explored through the defect and was found to be normal. The defect was closed using 3 × 3 cm polytetrafluoroethylene patch.
After deairing the patient was rewarmed and the heart picked up after single electric shock in sinus rhythm. The weaning from the bypass was easy.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable on minimal inotropic support and was extubated in second postoperative day without neurologic complications.

Case report and review of the literature,"A 30-year-old male patient was admitted to the Emergency Department of our hospital with a 24-hour history of abdominal pain which had developed suddenly and initially been colicky in nature, with intermittent vomiting and abdominal distension. There was no history of peritonitis, abdominal surgery or tuberculosis. There had been two similar episodes in one year. But, because of the spontaneous regression of the symptoms, he was not examined by any physician in those episodes. Because of the asthma and hypertension, he had used calcium canal blockers and teophiline for two years.
General physical examination revealed an anxious looking and mild dehydration. His pulse was 110/minute, temperature 37.8°C, blood pressure 130/70 mmHg. There was no cyanosis or jaundice. No abnormalities of the chest or cardiovascular system were found. Local examination of the abdomen revealed a distended abdomen, hypoactive bowel sounds, mild tenderness and rigidity in the whole abdomen. A tender lump was palpated in the umbilical region which moved from side to side with mild guarding. There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and rectal examination was unremarkable.
Routine laboratory workup revealed a total leukocyte count of 13300 cells/ml, hemoglobin of 17.9 g %, and normal serum chemistry and normal urine analysis. PA X-ray of the chest was normal but plain standing X-ray of the abdomen showed multiple air-fluid levels with no free gas under the diaphragm. An ultrasound examination of the abdomen showed normal liver, gallbladder, pancreas and kidneys. But there was a small amount of fluid in the pelvis and a heterogen, vascularized mass lesion was seen in the periumblical region which had 96 × 75 mm dimensions.
Under a provisional clinical diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction, emergency laparotomy was performed through a midline incision. After opening the peritoneum, especially the proximal section of the small bowel was observed to be dilated, its mesentery was edematous and the whole small bowel was covered by a dense whitish and approximately 2 mm thick membrane which gave the appearance of a cocoon (Figure). This membrane was freely mobile freed from the parietal peritoneum. There was a straw-colored fluid around 200 ml in the pelvis. The membrane enveloping the small bowel was incised carefully and separated from the intestinal serosa by sharp and blunt dissections and the whole small bowel was freed and followed from treitz to ileocaecal junction. Partial omentectomy and appendectomy were performed. The whole freed small bowel was viable and the colon was normal; thus no further surgical procedure was deemed necessary. The peeled-off membrane was studied histopathologically and microscopic examination revealed a chronic non-specific inflammatory reaction and mature fibrous tissue.
The patient had an uneventful post-operative period and was discharged from the hospital on the seventh post-operative day. He has been regularly attending our follow-up clinics for the last one year and has remained free of bowel symptoms throughout this period.","[[30.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['abdominal', 'abdominal', 'abdominal', 'chest', 'cardiovascular system', 'abdomen', 'abdomen', 'bowel', 'whole abdomen', 'umbilical region', 'rectal', 'chest', 'abdomen', 'under the diaphragm', 'abdomen', 'liver', 'gallbladder', 'pancreas', 'kidneys', 'pelvis', 'periumblical region', 'small bowel', 'midline incision', 'peritoneum', 'proximal section of the small bowel', 'mesentery', 'whole small bowel', 'membrane', 'membrane', 'parietal peritoneum', 'pelvis', 'membrane enveloping the small bowel', 'small bowel', 'intestinal serosa', 'treitz to ileocaecal junction', 'small bowel', 'colon', 'membrane', 'fibrous tissue', 'bowel']","['abdominal pain', 'vomiting', 'abdominal distension', 'peritonitis', 'tuberculosis', 'symptoms', 'asthma', 'hypertension', 'anxious looking', 'dehydration', 'cyanosis', 'jaundice', 'abnormalities', 'distended abdomen', 'hypoactive bowel sounds', 'tenderness', 'rigidity', 'tender lump', 'guarding', 'hepatomegaly', 'splenomegaly', 'air-fluid levels', 'free gas under the diaphragm', 'fluid', 'mass lesion', 'mechanical small bowel obstruction', 'small bowel obstruction', 'dilated', 'mesentery was edematous', 'whole small bowel was covered by a dense whitish', 'thick membrane', 'appearance of a cocoon', 'membrane was freely mobile freed', 'straw-colored fluid', 'small bowel was viable', 'colon was normal', 'peeled-off membrane', 'inflammatory reaction', 'mature fibrous tissue', 'uneventful post-operative period', 'bowel symptoms']",['teophiline'],"['30', 'Emergency Department']","['abdominal surgery', 'calcium canal blockers', 'physical examination', 'pulse', 'temperature', 'blood pressure', 'rectal examination', 'laboratory workup', 'total leukocyte count', 'hemoglobin', 'serum chemistry', 'urine analysis', 'PA X-ray of the chest', 'plain standing X-ray of the abdomen', 'ultrasound examination of the abdomen', 'emergency laparotomy was performed through a midline incision', 'opening the peritoneum, especially the proximal section of the small bowel', 'membrane enveloping the small bowel was incised carefully and separated from the intestinal serosa', 'small bowel was incised carefully and separated from the intestinal serosa by sharp and blunt dissections', 'whole small bowel was freed', 'Partial omentectomy', 'appendectomy', 'surgical procedure', 'histopathologically', 'microscopic examination']",['24-hour']

His only past medical history was hypertension. On examination, he was jaundiced with a temperature of 38.2°C, pulse 120 and a blood pressure of 130/80. He was found to have tender hepatomegaly. His blood results showed an anaemia of 9.6, mild renal impairment (urea 11.9, creatinine 142) and hepatic impairment (Bilirubin 60, AST 274, alkaline phosphatase 170). An X-Ray [figure ] revealed multiple gas filled lesions within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen which were confirmed on ultrasound as originating in the liver.
CT [figure ] revealed the presence of a central core of irregular soft tissue in the liver, which was thought to be an abscess. A drain was inserted under ultrasound guidance. Both the blood cultures and drainage fluid grew Clostridium septicum. He proceeded to have an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the central soft tissue core. Histology confirmed a necrotic metastatic adenocarcinoma with morphology consistent with a colorectal origin. Immunohistochemistry further supported this assumption as cytokeratin 7 was negative and both cytokeratin 20 and CEA were positive.

377,1459932-1,16675433,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1459932.xml,Case Report: A Case of Wood-Smoke–Related Pulmonary Disease,"A 53-year-old man from Mexico was referred to the San Francisco General Hospital chest clinic for the evaluation of a chronic cough and pulmonary nodules. His respiratory symptoms began in 1985 as an intermittent cough. The cough gradually progressed over the years and was now chronic, productive of yellow sputum, and associated with mild dyspnea. In 1997, he was diagnosed with asthma in Mexico and treated with inhaled bronchodilators with minimal relief. In 2004, he immigrated to the United States and was seen by a primary care provider for these symptoms and treated with a steroid inhaler without relief. At that evaluation, a chest radiograph was performed (), and he was then referred to a chest clinic.
At his chest clinic visit, he denied any current fevers, chills, sweats, weight loss, eye pain, arthralgias, rash, or sinusitis. He had no pets or mold at home, no recent travel, and no environmental tobacco smoke exposures. He reported no other medical conditions. He denied any tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.
His occupational history was significant for work at a charcoal production plant in Mexico when he was 18–26 years of age. He spent 10–12 hr/day burning wood to make charcoal, and he stood very near the fire. He described the environment as being very smoky. He did not use any protective respiratory masks. He denied mining, construction, or asbestos-related occupations. For the past year, he had been working in a restaurant as a dishwasher.
On physical examination, he appeared healthy without any signs of distress and had normal vital signs and an oxygen saturation of 97%. The remainder of the examination was normal except for bilateral forced expiratory wheezes. He had no signs of pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, or clubbing. Routine laboratory tests revealed a complete blood count and blood chemistry panel that were normal. Three sputum samples for mycobacteria had no growth at 56 days. Serologies for fungal diseases were negative.
We performed thoracic high-resolution computed axial tomography (HRCT), using 7 mm helical technique after intravenous contrast administration followed by high-resolution imaging, using 1 mm collimation every 1 cm from lung apex to base (). Pulmonary function test results were as follows: forced vital capacity (FVC), 3.46 L (91%); forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), 2.31 L (74%); FEV1:FVC ratio, 67; total lung capacity, 5.27 L (95%); residual volume, 1.57 L (91%); diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, 23.1 mL/mmHg/min (81%); and diffusion capacity for CO corrected for total lung capacity by single breath, 4.61 mL/mmHg/L (87%). Arterial blood gases were normal.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy for the suspected diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Bronchoscopy demonstrated a large black and gray plaque in the left mainstem bronchus () and multiple smaller gray and black deposits in the left upper lobe, left lower lobe, and right lower lobe. Transbronchial biopsies were obtained (). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed normal cell differential counts.

The patient had been healthy previously and denied any history of alcohol or drug abuse. This soldier specifically denied any history of smoking or pulmonary disorders. He had been in a tunnel without respiratory protection when a smoke grenade used to simulate battle conditions ignited near the entrance. The tunnel was about 1.75 m × 0.6 m × 360 m (5.74 ft × 1.97 ft × 1,181 ft). The estimated time of exposure to the HC/ZnO smoke was about 3 min. He suffered from lacrimation, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea, and sore throat at the scene.
On arrival at the hospital, the initial physical examination showed that the patient’s blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, his heart rate was 80 bpm, and his oral temperature was 38.1°C (100.6°F). His respirations were shallow but unlabored, with a rate of 19/min. Auscultation of the lungs was unremarkable. The cardiac examination revealed a normal S1 and S2 without murmur, gallop, rub, or click. Arterial blood gas analysis and blood chemistry test values were within the normal ranges except that the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels were elevated about 1.5-fold of normal limits and the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was marginally elevated. Leukocytosis with neutrophils predominating was also noted (). The leukocytosis returned to normal on the 10th day after the event.
He was admitted to the pulmonary ward for observation. Oxygen (6 L/min) was delivered by mask after admission. Exacerbation of his respiratory condition developed on the third day in the hospital. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral basal crackles. Radiography of the chest showed interstitial pulmonary infiltration in both lower lungs. Intravenous hydrocortisone (600 mg/day) and a prophylactic antibiotic (ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hr for 5 days) were administered. His respiratory condition improved after steroid therapy. The steroid dose was decreased gradually and discontinued 13 days after initiation. Elevation of liver enzymes was noted during hospitalization. ALT levels increased to 138 U/L on day 7 and peaked at 625 U/L on day 22 (). Serologic investigation was negative for viral hepatitis B and C. No significant abnormal findings were observed on abdominal sonography.
The patient was discharged on the 28th hospital day with a decreasing liver enzyme levels. Two weeks later (6 weeks after the accident), the patient’s liver function returned to normal.

He had been healthy previously and denied any history of alcohol or drug abuse. He also had dyspnea, cough, chest distress, and a sore throat. Physical examination revealed blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, and oral temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F). Arterial blood gas analysis and blood chemistry tests were within the normal ranges. Hematologic tests revealed leukocytosis with neutrophils predominant (). The leukocytosis returned to normal on the 9th day after the event.
Oxygen was given by face mask after admission. Two days later, the patient experienced progressive respiratory distress. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral expiratory wheezes. A chest radiograph revealed diffuse interstitial infiltrates. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest showed acute inhalation pneumonitis with patchy and small ill-defined nodular areas of ground-glass opacity over all lung fields.

380,1464140-1,16603056,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1464140.xml,Severe airway stenosis associated with Crohn's disease: Case report,"A 32-yr old Caucasian female patient presented in September 2004 with progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion. Since 2002, she had suffered from typical CD with arthritis, which had been diagnosed on clinical, endoscopic and histological grounds. She had undergone colonoscopy and biopsy in order to investigate symptoms of persistent diarrhea with abdominal pain, weight loss and fever. Colonoscopy had revealed mucosal ulcerations involving the distal ileum and right colon alternating with areas of normal-appearing mucosa and histological examination had shown transmural inflammation and epithelioid granulomas, typical of CD. In the following years, her gastrointestinal symptoms were well-controlled on sulphasalazine 3000 mg·day-1, azathioprine 100 mg·day-1 and folic acid 5 mg·day-1 and she experienced no exacerbations. Over the past year she has suffered from recurrent episodes of acute bronchitis. She has been repeatedly treated with antibiotics and short courses of oral steroids, followed by improvement of symptoms of infection (cough and sputum production). She complained, however, of progressive deterioration of her dyspnea and was referred by her family doctor to the Thoracic Department of the University Hospital of Heraklion for further evaluation and treatment.
On presentation, severe dyspnea on exertion subsiding at rest was noted. On physical examination, the patient was tachypnoeic and had stridor, reduced breath sounds and diffuse wheezing on auscultation. She was a lifelong non-smoker and had no history of occupational or environmental exposure relevant to lung disease. Her temperature was 36.6°C and her arterial oxygen saturation at rest was 97% (room air). Post exertion arterial blood-gas analysis did not reveal hypoxemia (alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient at peak exercise was 10 mmHg). The electrocardiogram and chest radiographs were normal. Laboratory investigations showed normal serum values of electrolytes, glucose, protein, liver function tests, urea and creatinine. Other laboratory tests showed a moderately increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 31 mm·1 h-1, and normal C-reactive protein (< 0.32 mg/dl). Complete blood count revealed mildly elevated white blood cell count (12.3 K·μl-1, 90.8% neutrophils). Assessments of anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA, both cytoplasmic- and perinuclear-ANCA), and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (sACE) were normal. Serologic tests for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and influenza viruses were all negative. Tuberculin skin test was negative. Sputum cultures for mycobacteria and fungi were negative. Pulmonary function tests showed airway obstruction (Table ) and flow-volume curve intra-extrathoracic airway obstruction. There was no improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) following inhalation of β2-agonist. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the trachea revealed a 2-cm region of severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with marked increase in tracheal wall thickness (Figure ). High resolution computed tomography scan (HRCT) of the thorax did not show any abnormalities.
A fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) was performed, and showed severe circumferential tracheal stenosis, greater than 70%, 1–2 cm beneath the vocal cords and marked inflammation of tracheal mucosa (Figure ). The patient did not tolerate penetration of the bronchoscope through the obstruction. Bacteriologic studies of bronchial washings, including cultures for mycobacteria and fungi, were negative. Cytologic studies of bronchial washings showed inflammatory cells and no malignant cells. Histological examination of several biopsies of the stenosed areas revealed acute and chronic inflammation and extended ulceration of bronchial mucosa, without granulomas (Figure ).
The patient received inhaled budesonide 800 μg·day-1 and methylprednisolone 120 mg·day-1 iv for 5 days. Then she continued on oral methylprednisolone 24 mg·day-1 and inhaled budesonide 800 μg·day-1. During the following months she reported improvement of her shortness of breath, accompanied by gradual improvement of her lung function tests (Table ). In May 2005 she was referred to the Complex Airway Center of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for further evaluation.
On presentation in the Complex Airway Center, her throat on auscultation revealed mild inspiratory stridor. There was otherwise no wheezing, chest exam was normal, as was the remainder of her examination, and room air oxygenation was 99%. A specialized airway CT was performed, which demonstrated a 2-cm region of circumferential subglottic stenosis with focal narrowing that did not spare the membranous portion of the trachea (Figure ). The remainder of the trachea appeared unremarkable without evidence of tracheobronchomalacia. There were regions of patchy ground glass opacity in the superior segment of the right middle lobe, with some centrilobular nodular opacities and patchy opacities in the right lower lobe superior segment with air trapping.
At flexible bronchoscopy a high-grade subglottic obstruction was visible at about 7 or 8 mm diameter opening. The obstruction was complex, reaching from the posterior subglottic area close to the vocal cords and posterior arytenoids all the way down to the cricoid ring in a circular fashion. Rigid bronchoscopy confirmed the subglottic stenosis and showed that it extended into the first tracheal ring. The area was biopsied, dilated sequentially to 12 mm and the remaining tissues were cleanly ablated with the help of a microdebrider. The diameter achieved in the end was approximately 14 mm and appeared normal for her size. Five cc of 0.04% mitomycin-C was also applied for four minutes. During the rigid bronchoscopy several additional abnormalities were visualized. The left upper lobe was near-totally occluded by a web-like obstruction, which was also biopsied and dilated. Moreover, the right medial segment of the right lower lobe was near-totally occluded with what appeared to be mucosal and submucosal swelling, which was again extensively biopsied and a lumen was reestablished. The pathology results revealed partially ulcerated respiratory mucosa with squamous metaplasia, lamina propria fibrosis, recent hemorrhages and acute and chronic inflammation in all three locations, but no granulomas.
This treatment led to complete remission of the patient's respiratory symptoms up to the point that this report is written, 10 months after dilatation. She continued treatment with oral methylprednisolone 24 mg·day-1, inhaled budesonide 800 μg·day-1 and oral omeprazole 20 mg·day-1. The patient will be closely followed with pulmonary function tests and endoscopic approaches, if necessary, and progressive tapering of oral steroid treatment over the following months will be attempted.","[[32.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['abdominal', 'mucosal', 'distal ileum', 'right colon', 'mucosa', 'transmural', 'gastrointestinal', 'lung', 'arterial', 'alveolar-arterial', 'chest', 'liver',

381,1464147-1,16643652,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1464147.xml,Ectopic Cushing' syndrome caused by a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the mesentery,"In September 2003, a 41-year-old man presented with unexplained progressive weight gain, facial plethora, tremor, sweating, newly-diagnosed hypertension, hypokalemia, and diabetes mellitus. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 170/110 mm Hg, pulse of 88 bpm, thyroid enlargement, and cushingoid features including striae, moon face, central obesity, and a buffalo hump. Laboratory testing showed hyperthyroidism (undetectable TSH, free T4 of 32 pmol/L (normal: 12–22), free T3 of 9 pmol/L (normal: 3.95–6.80)) and increased 24 h urinary free cortisol (7579 nmol per day, normal range: 22–212). Thyroid ultrasound showed a multinodular goiter. A Tc-99m-pertechnetate thyroid scan revealed increased uptake in an area of the left thyroid gland corresponding to an autonomous adenoma. Serum calcitonin was within the normal range. Basal serum cortisol and plasma ACTH were significantly elevated at 1307 nmol/l (normal range: 187–724) and 22.51 pmol/l (1.98–11.4), respectively. After a 2-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, serum cortisol was still at 1132 nmol/l (normal, < 80). Midnight cortisol was elevated at 847 nmol/l. After an overnight 8-mg dexamethasone suppression test, serum cortisol decreased by 38 % of basal values suggesting ectopic ACTH-secretion (EAS). CRH stimulated serum cortisol and plasma ACTH to less than 4 % of basal values. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) did not show significant central-to-peripheral ACTH gradients. Ectopic ACTH syndrome was diagnosed. Computed tomography (CT) scans at first presentation did not show pulmonary and/or abdominal tumors, however, both adrenals appeared enlarged with the left gland showing a tumor of 1 cm size. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head demonstrated a small 3 mm hypointense and hypoenhancing lesion of the neurohypophysis (Fig. ). An 111In-pentetreotide scan showed radiotracer enrichment in the left thyroid gland consistent with the region of the autonomous adenoma and faint focal octreotide enhancement in the abdomen which was interpreted to be nonspecific because of lacking correlation on CT scan and changing location of enhancement between early and late scan (Fig. ). Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and colonoscopy showed normal results. Thyroid antibodies were negative, supporting the scintigraphic finding that hyperthyroidism in this patient was caused by an autonomous adenoma. Given the scenario of EAS and an octreoscan being reliably positive only in the left thyroid gland, we decided to perform a left-sided hemithyroidectomy and subtotal resection of the right gland after treatment with methimazole, although basal calcitonin was normal and pentagastrin stimulation could not be performed because it was not available. Extensive pathological workup of the thyroid specimen did not reveal an ACTH-producing endocrine tumor but a 2 mm sized benign nodule on the right side, and 2 benign nodules (1 cm and 2 cm in diameter, respectively) within the left thyroid gland.
Whereas hyperthyroidism improved rapidly, hypercortisolism persisted. Because the patient had elevated liver function tests, thereby limiting the use of ketoconazole, we began metyrapone (2.5 g/d divided into 750 mg in the morning and at noon, and 1 g in the evening to perform medical adrenalectomy) combined with hydrocortisone replacement (10 mg in the morning at at noon, and 5 mg in the evening) to achieve normal 24 h urinary cortisol values. Regular follow-up examinations at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after initial presentation confirmed the pituitary lesion within the posterior lobe, while CT scans of thorax and abdomen remained negative except for the left-sided adrenal tumor. 24 h urinary catecholamines including fractionated metanephrines were negative. Over the following months, control of hypercortisolism by metyrapone became difficult and the question arose whether bilateral adrenalectomy should be performed. Therefore, we consulted a neuropathologist/pathologist (A.O.V.) and neurosurgeon (E.H.O.) at the National Institutes of Health whether they ever had seen an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma located in the posterior lobe (see ref. 1). Subsequently, transsphenoidal surgery was performed to explore the pituitary lesion in our patient. Despite complete removal of this lesion, hypercortisolism persisted and metyrapone therapy was continued. Histological workup of the removed pituitary tissue revealed normal posterior pituitary. Postoperatively, diabetes insipidus developed and persisted. An extensive re-evaluation was performed 18 months after initial presentation. An octreoscan revealed tracer accumulation in projection of the upper and middle part of the right abdomen (Fig. ). Additional 18F-FDG PET showed increased glucose metabolism of this abdominal area. In accordance with these findings, a 21 × 15 mm tumor mass was demonstrated on CT and MRI scans in this region (Fig. ). In retrospect, this tumor could also be seen in earlier CT scans but had been interpreted as normal intestine because of smaller size, atypical location for an ACTH-producing tumor, and only moderate uptake on octreotide scans. We decided to perform an explorative laparotomy. Before surgery, 111In-pentetreotide was administered to support tumor localization during surgery with a gamma counter and facilitate maximal tumor removal (Fig. ). After the abdominal wall had been opened, the neuroendocrine tumor was instantly visible (Fig. ). Because this lesion had been initially assumed to be metastatic tissue of a primary neuroendocrine tumor and a multifocal appearance of the abdominal 111In-pentetreotide enhancement, the gamma probe was used to detect further tumor tissue (Fig. ). Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of the removed tissue revealed a well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the mesentery with strong expression of ACTH (Fig. ). The tumor also strongly expressed NSE, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin. The MIB-1 proliferation index was approximately 1 %. Immunohistochemical analyses for the expression of somatostatin receptors type 1 to 5 were negative. All removed lymph nodes were tumor-negative but also showed increased activity by the gamma probe during surgery.
Follow-up at four weeks and at 4 (7) months after surgery showed a normal 2 mg dexamethasone suppression test and 24 h urinary cortisol levels. Plasma ACTH levels were normal (4.9 and 5.2 pmol/L, normal: 1.8–12.8). NSE was 10.7 ng/ml (normal, < 13), chromogranin A and calcitonin were undetectable. In addition, the insulin requirement to treat the patient' s type 2 diabetes declined by more than 50%. At 7 month follow-up, the patient had regained strength and muscle mass, did not need further potassium replacement, and felt fine. An octreoscan showed normal results.","[[41.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['facial', 'thyroid', 'Thyroid', 'thyroid', 'left thyroid gland', 'thyroid', 'basal', 'Inferior petrosal sinus', 'pulmonary', 'abdominal', 'both adrenals', 'left gland', 'head', 'left thyroid gland', 'abdomen', 'Thyroid', 'left thyroid gland', 'right gland', 'thyroid', 'endocrine', 'left thyroid gland', 'liver', 'pituitary', 'posterior lobe', 'thorax', 'abdomen', 'left-sided adrenal', 'pituitary', 'posterior lobe', 'transsphenoidal', 'pituitary', 'pituitary tissue', 'posterior pituitary', 'upper and middle part of the right abdomen', 'abdominal area', 'intestine', 'abdominal wall', 'neuroendocrine', 'neuroendocrine', 'abdominal', 'tissue', 'neuroendocrine', 'mesentery', 'lymph nodes', 'muscle']","['weight gain', 'facial plethora', 'tremor', 'sweating', 'hypertension', 'hypokalemia', 'diabetes mellitus', 'thyroid enlargement', 'cushingoid features', 'striae', 'moon face', 'central obesity', 'buffalo hump', 'hyperthyroidism', 'multinodular goiter', 'increased uptake', 'autonomous adenoma', 'ectopic ACTH-secretion', 'EAS', 'ACTH gradients', 'Ectopic ACTH syndrome', 'tumors', 'enlarged', 'tumor', 'hypointense and hypoenhancing lesion of the neurohypophysis', 'radiotracer enrichment', 'region of the autonomous adenoma', 'focal octreotide enhancement', 'changing location of enhancement', 'hyperthyroidism', 'autonomous adenoma', 'EAS', 'ACTH', 'endocrine tumor', 'nodule', 'nodules', 'hyperthyroidism', 'hypercortisolism', 'normal 24 h urinary cortisol values', 'pituitary lesion', 'left-sided adrenal tumor', 'ACTH', 'pituitary adenoma', 'pituitary lesion', 'lesion', 'hypercortisolism', 'normal posterior pituitary', 'diabetes insipidus', 'tracer accumulation', 'increased glucose metabolism', 'tumor mass', 'tumor', 'normal intestine', 'ACTH-producing tumor', 'uptake', 'tumor', 'tumor localization', 'tumor', 'neuroendocrine tumor', 'lesion', 'metastatic tissue', 'neuroendocrine tumor', 'abdominal 111In-pentetreotide enhancement', 'tumor tissue', 'neuroendocrine carcinoma of the mesentery', 'ACTH', 'tumor', 'NSE', 'chromogranin A', 'synaptophysin', 'somatostatin receptors type 1 to 5', 'tumor-negative', 'increased activity', 'diabetes', 'regained strength', 'muscle mass', 'felt fine']","['dexamethasone', 'methimazole', 'ketoconazole', 'metyrapone', 'hydrocortisone', 'metyrapone', 'metyrapone', '111In-pentetreotide', 'dexamethasone', 'insulin']","['September 2003', '41', 'A.O.V.', 'E.H.O.']","['Physical examination', 'blood pressure', 'pulse', 'Laboratory testing', 'TSH', 'free T4', 'free T3', 'urinary free cortisol', 'Thyroid ultrasound', 'Tc-99m-pertechnetate thyroid scan', 'Serum calcitonin', 'Basal serum cortisol', 'plasma ACTH', 'dexamethasone suppression test', 'serum cortisol', 'cortisol', 'dexamethasone suppression test', 'suppression test', 'serum', 'serum cortisol', 'serum cortisol', 'plasma ACTH', 'Inferior petrosal sinus sampling', 'Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS)', 'IPSS', 'Computed tomography (CT) scans', 'magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head', '111In-pentetreotide scan', 'CT scan', 'Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)', 'colonoscopy', 'Thyroid antibodies', 'scintigraphic', 'octreoscan', 'left-sided hemithyroidectomy', 'subtotal resection of the right gland', 'basal calcitonin', 'pentagastrin stimulation', 'pathological workup of the thyroid specimen', 'liver function tests', 'adrenalectomy', 'urinary cortisol', 'CT scans of thorax and abdomen', 'urinary catecholamines', 'fractionated metanephrines', 'control of hypercortisolism', 'bilateral adrenalectomy', 'transsphenoidal surgery', 'complete removal of this lesion', 'Histological workup', 'removed pituitary tissue', 'extensive re-evaluation', 'octreoscan', '18F-FDG PET', 'CT', 'MRI scans', 'CT scans', 'octreotide scans', 'explorative laparotomy', 'surgery', 'surgery', 'maximal tumor removal', 'abdominal wall had been opened', 'gamma probe', 'Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of the removed tissue', 'MIB-1 proliferation index', 'Immunohistochemical analyses', 'All removed lymph nodes', 'gamma probe', 'surgery', 'surgery', '2 mg dexamethasone suppression test', 'urinary cortisol levels', 'Plasma ACTH levels', 'NSE', 'chromogranin A', 'calcitonin', 'potassium replacement', 'octreoscan']","['per day', 'overnight', 'Midnight', 'overnight', '24 h', '24 h', 'Over the following months', 'Postoperatively', '18 months', '7 month', '7 month']"

No other masses were palpable. The ultrasound (US) evaluation showed a 38.5 mm solitary cystic lesion with irregular margins in the left lateral cervical region that lacked a vascular signal (Figure ). Thyroid US showed a gland with an inhomogeneous echostructure but devoid of any focal lesion. A computed tomography scan (CT) the neck lesion showed a low density, irregular-circumscribed mass measuring 35 mm (Figure ). The mass disappeared following a CT-guided aspiration of 15 ml of chocolate brown colored fluid. This fluid, on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) examination showed an amorphous and hematic material and cells with nuclear irregularities that warranted the resection of the lesion. The histology of the resected lesion demonstrated a thyroid papillary carcinoma arising within the multiloculated neck branchial cyst (Figure ). The non neoplastic cystic spaces were lined by a monolayer of cuboical cells with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and central enlarged nuclei. At immunohistochemistry for thyroglobulin, these cells showed positive staining of the apical portion of the cytoplasm (Figure ). After one month, the patient underwent a total thyroidectomy with central and lateral compartment lymph nodes dissection. Histology showed a multifocal papillary carcinoma.

Physical examination demonstrated oxygen saturation of 91%, with normal temperature and vital signs. His weight had fallen from 79.2 to 77.1 kg over 3 months. Cardiovascular exam was entirely normal. Lungs demonstrated coarse breath sounds bilaterally with scattered rales throughout the lung fields. The abdomen was normal, extremities demonstrated significant clubbing and there was no peripheral edema. Forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) had decreased from 50% to 36%. The chest radiograph resembled baseline findings with no obvious infiltrate or pneumothroax. He received a month-long course of azithromycin, aztreonam and inhaled tobramycin for suspected pulmonary exacerbation of acute super-infection in the setting of underlying chronic CF lung disease.
One month later, follow-up revealed no improvement in dyspnea and no change in the scant sputum production, despite full adherence to the antibiotic regimen and airway clearance techniques. Exertional discomfort located along the sternum and left anterior chest associated with dyspnea without radiation or pressure sensation was further described but was not associated with palpitations, diaphoresis or nausea. This discomfort improved with rest and was not associated with meals. He did report the need to sleep upright in a recliner, but denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
CF was diagnosed in this patient by sweat chloride at age 35 after an episode of hemoptysis, with subsequent genetic analysis identifying a ΔF508, 2789+5G>A mutation. He also has gastroesophageal reflux, Barrett's esophagus, azoospermia, and pancreatic insufficiency. He had sinus surgery at age 47. Medications include albuterol, ipratropium, fluticasone, dornase alpha, salmeterol, omeprazole, pancreatin and multivitamin. The patient's father had a myocardial infarction at age 37, his mother had coronary artery bypass surgery at 52 years of age, and a brother underwent coronary bypass at age 61. The patient has never smoked and alcohol intake was minimal.
Diagnostic testing demonstrated normal white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet count. Electrolytes, albumin, protein and glucose were normal with a 5.1% HbA1c. Total cholesterol was 139 mg/dl, LDL 80 mg/dl, HDL 30 mg/dl and triglycerides at 76 mg/dl. Chronic findings with cystic changes were evident on chest radiograph, but with no obvious consolidation. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with a left anterior fascicular block and normal ST findings.
Stress thallium testing was subsequently arranged within a week of the follow up visit, with results positive for moderate anteroseptal area of reversible perfusion with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Subsequent heart catheterization revealed 99% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery with extension into the two diagonal branches, 100% obstruction of the left anterior descending artery at the trifurcation and 70% lesion affecting the first posterior lateral branch of the circumflex artery. The patient was evaluated for possible coronary artery bypass graft; however, because of his current pulmonary status, angioplasty was elected with successful stenting of the left anterior descending artery.

386,1475607-1,16689991,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1475607.xml,Severe reversible cardiac failure after bortezomib treatment combined with chemotherapy in a non-small cell lung cancer patient: a case report,"A 53-year-old male patient with stage IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, not invading the great vessels or heart structures, was treated with bortezomib combined with cisplatin-gemcitabine. The patient completed four 3-week cycles of bortezomib 1.0 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on day 1, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8. An impressive radiological partial response (PR) was observed after 2 cycles of therapy, and confirmed after 4 cycles, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria []. The longest diameter of the primary tumor in the left lower lobe had decreased from 85 to 35 millimeters (minus 59%).
However, from cycle 2 onwards, the patient had complained of increasing fatigue, orthopnea, and dyspnea on exertion. This was most evident during the first days of each cycle, following bortezomib, gemcitabine and cisplatin administration, including cisplatin-hydration (6 liter of fluids in 27 hours). Though he had been a heavy smoker (36 pack years) and had a history of COPD he did not have a documented or symptomatic prior cardiac history.
Because of the good anti-tumor response, treatment was continued. Upon admission for start of cycle 5, auscultation of the heart had revealed no abnormalities. Pulmonary auscultation was unchanged compared to prior examinations with a diffuse prolonged expiration and occasional rales but no crepitations. Central venous pressure as determined by neck vein distension was not elevated and there was no peripheral edema. During the night he received a transfusion of two packed cells for anemia (Hb 5.4 mmol/l).
Upon completion of cisplatin prehydration (1 liter of fluids), the patient became progressively dyspnoic. He did not experience any chest pain. An ECG did not show signs of ischemia. Chest-x-ray showed an increased heart-chest ratio of 0.57 compared to baseline 0.50, and mild signs of redistribution. His dyspnea improved remarkably upon administration of furosemide.
All chemotherapy was discontinued and he was released the next day in a clinically stable condition, though fatigue and dyspnea upon exertion had considerably worsened compared to baseline. An echocardiography performed the following week showed dilatation of the left ventricle and atrium. Ejection fraction (EF) was estimated to be 10–15%. A cardiac 99mTc-MIBI scan performed two weeks later showed diffuse hypokinesis and fixed perfusion defects in the apex and inferior wall. Treatment was initiated with atenolol, lisinopril and acenocoumarol. The first three months of follow-up did not show clinical improvement, and an echocardiography performed at that time estimated EF still at 20–30%. For these reasons no consolidation radiotherapy to the primary tumor was given. Fortunately, at six months of follow-up his condition had improved to New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-II. At that time coronary angiography was performed which did not show significant abnormalities aside from calcification of the left anterior descending artery. At eight months of follow-up, a Multiple Gate Acquisition (MUGA)-scan showed a restoration of the EF to 45%. Unfortunately, at this time progression of his lung tumor was evident and second-line therapy was started shortly after.
As we did not have a pre-treatment EF value of this patient, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was determined in a pre-treatment serum sample as a surrogate marker for baseline left ventricular function (LVF). Figure shows that already at baseline NT-proBNP was considerably elevated at 1389 ng/L, corresponding to a level generally found in NYHA Class II-III patients []. Analyzing two additional serum samples showed an increase to 2569 ng/L post cycle 2 (six weeks on treatment) and to 5177 ng/L at end-of-treatment (post cycle 4, twelve weeks on treatment) indicating a progressive worsening of the LVF during treatment. Troponin as well as CK-MB levels were not elevated in any of the samples tested. As a control, NT-proBNP at baseline and end-of-treatment was determined in two other patients participating in the same clinical trial and who had similar exposure to bortezomib and chemotherapy. NT-proBNP remained within normal limits in these two patients. Also LVEF was determined by MUGA-scan at baseline and at end-of-treatment in these two patients and found not to have decreased during treatment. A baseline and end-of-treatment MUGA-scan had been incorporated into the trial design after occurrence of the case as described above. In the case patient, at eleven months of follow-up and cardiac medication, NT-proBNP had decreased to a level within normal limits (110 ng/L).
We attribute the severe reduction of the LVEF in this case primarily to the drug treatment with bortezomib, gemcitabine and cisplatin. Main arguments are its reversibility and the negative findings of coronary angiography and additional investigations. The straining cisplatin-hydration was probably also an attributing factor, though unlikely to be the primary cause, as one would generally not expect such a slow recovery after a mere overload induced cardiac failure.
Cisplatin and gemcitabine have not been clearly associated with cardiac failure, though cisplatin has been occasionally associated with acute as well as late arterial occlusive events such as myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular thrombotic events. Cisplatin-induced alteration of platelet aggregation as well as vascular damage are possibly involved [-]. A study evaluating LVEF of 31 NSCLC patients immediately before and 12 weeks after finishing first-line cisplatin-gemcitabine chemotherapy did not demonstrate a significant decrease in LVEF [].
Clinical experience with bortezomib so far indicates that the incidence of cardiac failure or other cardiovascular effects remains incidental. Nevertheless, the US package insert states that acute development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and/or new onset of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction has been reported []. It must be noted that the package insert covers adverse events observed with bortezomib monotherapy only, which does not require pre- and/or post-hydration and represents a minimal fluid load. The largest study conducted so far with bortezomib was the APEX study, a 669 patient phase 3 study, comparing bortezomib with high-dose dexamethasone in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. This study did not show a negative impact of bortezomib on the incidence of congestive heart failure, which was comparable in both arms at 2 percent [].
There is evidence from literature that activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) occurs in chronic conditions of left ventricular hypertrophy and (dilated) cardiomyopathy. Increased expression of genes coding for ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was demonstrated in a rat cardiac hypertrophy model []. Furthermore, in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients, increased expression of regulatory proteins of the UPS was demonstrated by functional proteomics in heart tissue specimens. Activation of the UPS, leading to an altered protein expression in cardiac muscle cells, has been proposed to be an adaptive mechanism for maintaining a normal stroke volume []. Interestingly, susceptibility for cardiovascular disease has been ascribed to age-related decrease in proteasome activity, impairing the the ability of myocytes to mount an appropriate response to stress [].

The lack of any pain sensation was the reason for the delay of seeing a physician. His medical history was significant for severe benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was heavy tobacco smoker until recently. No history of alcohol intake was referred.
Clinical examination of the oral cavity revealed an oversized pigmented soft mass arising from the left half of his hard palate involving the soft palate and the ipsilateral palatine tonsil causing partial obstruction of the oral cavity and the oropharynx (Figure ). Some pigmented macules of various sizes were also noted growing at the periphery of the tumor. During neck palpation a 2 × 3 cm firm mobile non-tender mass was palpated at the left upper jugular region. A punch biopsy of the oral mass was performed.
A complete blood cell count, biochemical profile, and urinalysis were ordered without significant findings. A chest x ray was normal.
Histological examination of the specimen demonstrated extensive infiltration of the ulcerated mucosa by neoplastic predominantly epithelioid cells, in a solid, nested, trabecular or alveolar pattern. The cells were round to oval, having prominent eosinophilic nucleoli and atypical mitotic figures. In areas with intact surface epithelium was identified continuity of the tumor with the epithelium. There were also brown pigment deposition and neoplastic giant cells (figure ).
A computer tomography with contrast revealed pathologically enlarged cervical lymph nodes of the left neck. Signs of infiltration of the ipsilateral medial pterygoid muscle were also observed (figure ).
Work up for distant metastases (CT scan of chest, brain and abdomen plus bone scintigraphy) was negative.
Medical information was provided to the patient and his family regarding the diagnosis, staging, therapeutic options and prognosis. Our patient excluded any option of invasive treatment.

Clinical examination revealed upper limb hypertension, with similar blood pressures in both arms (180/100 mm Hg). His past history included repair of coarctation of aorta about 30 years ago. The medical records and operative details from the previous operation were unavailable. The operation had been performed through a left thoracotomy. An MRI scan revealed a 2 cm long narrowing of the aorta just distal to the origin of an aberrant right subclavian artery, which was the last of four branches from the aortic arch (Fig. ). The origins of the arch vessels did not show any sign of narrowing. The aortic root and ascending aorta were 3.5 cm in diameter, and the arch was of normal calibre. The diameter in the region of the stenosis was 1.4 cm with an additional web-like stenotic lesion at the distal end of the stenotic segment. There was evidence of calcification, possibly of an interposition tube graft which had been used at the time of the first operation. The descending thoracic aorta was of normal calibre.
In view of his symptomatic status, a re-intervention was considered appropriate. In view of his previous surgery, and especially the fact that the area of re-coarctation appeared to be calcified, it was decided to approach the aorta via a median sternotomy and construct an extra-anatomic ascending to descending thoracic aorta bypass graft. Cardiopulmonary bypass would be necessary to lift the heart out of the way to gain access to the descending thoracic aorta just above the diaphragm. We planned to use an apical suction device to keep the empty beating heart elevated.
The sternotomy was completed uneventfully. The pericardial cavity was obliterated with dense adhesions. This was rather surprising since we had anticipated that the previous procedure would have been extra-pericardial. However, further dissection revealed a large hole in the pericardial sac with the left lung directly adherent to the heart. The adhesions were released, some of them after establishing cardiopulmonary bypass using ascending aortic cannulation for inflow and bicaval cannulation (to maintain adequate venous drainage even after lifting up the heart) for venous outflow. Once the apex and the posterior surface of the heart were free of adhesions, an apical suction device (URCHIN™ Heart Positioner, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis MN55432-5604 USA) was placed in position and the beating heart was lifted superiorly. This allowed further dissection in the posterior pericardium and allowing freeing up of adhesions between the left lung and the descending thoracic aorta, and allowed visualization of and access to the descending thoracic aorta just above the diaphragm in spite of a deep thoracic cavity (Fig. ). Proximal and distal cross clamps were applied isolating a 4 cm length of aorta. A longitudinal incision was made in this segment and an 18 mm Haemashield Platinum™ Woven Double Velour Vascular tube graft (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA 01760-1537) was anastomosed in an end to side manner using continuous 3-0 polypropylene sutures. The clamps were released, the distal one first, the aorta was de-aired and the anastomosis was checked. The graft was then routed to the right of the inferior vena cava and brought up alongside the right atrium to the ascending aorta. The apical suction device was released and the heart was replaced in the pericardial sac. The length of the tube graft was estimated after filling up the heart. A side biting clamp was applied to the ascending aorta and the proximal anastomosis of the tube graft was constructed to a longitudinal arteriotomy using 3-0 polypropylene sutures. The clamp was released, the graft was de-aired, and the anastomosis checked. The patient was weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass with no inotropic support. Haemostasis was ensured and the chest was closed in the routine manner leaving two drains in the left pleural space, one drain in the pericardial sac and one in the mediastinum.
The patient was extubated eight hours after arrival in the intensive care unit. His drains were removed the next morning. He made an uneventful recovery thereafter except for needing some respiratory support with non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure for treating basal atelectasis. A CT scan was done prior to his discharge from hospital on the tenth postoperative day. Figure shows an oblique 3-D reconstructed view from the CT scan demonstrating the locations of the proximal and distal anastomoses, and the lie of the graft. The patient was reviewed in outpatients six weeks after his discharge. His claudication pain had disappeared completely.

Ca-19.9 was mildly elevated. CT-guided FNA was non-diagnostic, and endoscopic ultrasound was not available. At surgery – a risky procedure given his renal impairment – a large tumour was noted posterior to the duodenum, with bulky lymphadenopathy and peritoneal seeding. Although pancreatic carcinoma or polycystic kidney disease of the pancreas was suspected, intra-operative frozen section revealed CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Figure and ). Formal staging with gallium scan and BMAT did not reveal further dissemination. Given potential for cure with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, resection was not performed.
Systemic combination chemotherapy with dose-modified CHOP was administered, after explanation of risk of significant toxicity and treatment-related end-stage renal failure.

Unfortunately she remained hypotensive and so she underwent emergency angiography which showed patent coronary arteries except for the left anterior descending artery which was occluded distally. After this procedure she was noted to have a pansystolic murmur and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) using a Vivid 7 Pro (GE Vingned, Norway), confirmed a 1 cm antero-apical VSD and an akinetic ventricular apex.
To manage her hypotension inotropes were commenced and an intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted. After stabilization for 5 days, diuretics and nitrates were added for progressing pulmonary oedema. Repeat TTE images showed no change, and although the right ventricle was mildly dilated, global left ventricular function was preserved. A decision was made to perform a delayed surgical repair to reduce operative risk.
She was reviewed in the local multi-disciplinary meeting and transcatheter closure was not thought to be appropriate. Four weeks after admission, she developed short episodes of ventricular tachycardia which were controlled by amiodarone. Two days later she deteriorated becoming hypotensive with worsening pulmonary oedema. She became hypoxic and hypercarbic and dobutamine infusion was added along with an escalation in her diuretic therapy. Sedation and mechanical ventilation were then required. Repeat TTE remained unchanged. A pulmonary artery flotation catheter was inserted and norepinephrine was commenced to treat persistent hypotension. Renal function began to deteriorate with serum creatinine rising to 190 μmol l-1.
Thirty days after myocardial infarction, she underwent an off-pump 'Hamburger' post-infarct VSD repair. The heart was approached through a median sternotomy and a posterior-anterior septal plication was performed using three double-armed Teflon felt supported interrupted 1.0 Ticron sutures (Syneture™, USA). The Teflon strip was preloaded with sutures and from below the needles were passed through the posterior (inferior) interventricular septum aiming for the anterior part of the septum where the tip of the needle is retrieved. The sutures run just lateral to the LAD to ensure plicating the thicker left ventricular wall rather than the thinner right ventricular wall (Figure ). The needles were then passed through the second Teflon strip and then tied starting at the apex and working more proximally (Figure ). VSD closure was assessed using transesophageal (Figure ) and epicardial echocardiography as well and by epicardial auscultation.
Soon after surgery, she began to improve and her inotropes and frusemide were discontinued. However she required a tracheotomy to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The patient was a heavy smoker (70 cig/24 h) and reported mild abdominal distention during the last month and an episode of anal bleeding 4 years ago, which had been attributed to hemorrhoids. His mother died after surgical operation for multiple polyposis coli.
The physical examination revealed abdominal distention, hypoactive bowel sounds, and a large palpable intra-abdominal mass with peritoneal signs. A palpable osteomatosis of the right mandible, multiple sebaceous cysts and subcutaneous fibromas of the trunk and head were observed. The absence of intestinal sounds, the distention and the abdominal contraction suggested acute abdomen. The blood analysis suggested leukocytosis (WBC 18110/μL out of which 94% were neutrophils) and anemia (Hct 29.3% and Hb 7.7 g/dl).
Abdominal ultrasound revealed a large mass with necrotic lesions. Triplex study of the mass indicated decreased internal circulation with measurable velocity. An abdominal CT scan that performed after oral gastrographin administration and IV contrast medium infusion, revealed a large intra-abdominal neoplastic mass consisting of tissues of variable density. The mass was extended from the pancreas to the pelvic entrance (figure ). The tumor displaced the adjacent visceral structures. Other findings include a small diaphragmatic hernia, and a hypodense enlargement of the right adrenal due to adrenal adenoma. Sigmoidoscopy up to 20 cm revealed multiple polyps.
The patient was surgically treated. After entering the abdominal cavity a large solid neoplasmatic mass which invaded parts of the small and large intestine was recognized. The abdominal tumor was resected, along with the involved parts of the small intestine and the right colon (Figure ). The excised right colon revealed numerous small and large polyps, suggesting a background of familial polyposis. The adrenal adenoma was also resected; cholecystectomy was carried out due to co-existing cholelithiasis in order to prevent biliary obstruction.
Postoperative ophthalmologic examination of the fundus, revealed the characteristic black spots of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium typical of Gardner syndrome. Full length colonoscopy was scheduled after patient's discharge. Unfortunately the patient died three months later from acute myocardial infarction. We failed to identify clinically any only obvious risk factors for the subsequent AMI except smoking.
The histological examination of the specimen revealed desmoid tumor. Further cytogenetic studies along with APC mutation analysis confirmed the diagnosis. Mutation was identified in exon 9 and codon 1444.
Extra-abdominal manifestations of Gardner's syndrome along with a palpable abdominal mass would raise suspicion for the presence of a desmoid tumor in the majority of cases. Computed tomography would help to establish the diagnosis [-]. The patient was discharged the 12th postoperative day.","[[41.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['abdominal', 'abdominal', 'abdominal', 'anal', 'abdominal', 'bowel', 'intra-abdominal', 'peritoneal', 'right mandible', 'sebaceous', 'subcutaneous', 'trunk', 'head', 'intestinal', 'abdominal', 'abdomen', 'Abdominal', 'abdominal', 'intra-abdominal', 'tissues', 'pancreas to the pelvic entrance', 'visceral structures', 'diaphragmatic', 'right adrenal', 'adrenal', 'abdominal', 'abdominal cavity', 'small and large intestine', 'abdominal', 'small intestine', 'right colon', 'right colon', 'adrenal', 'biliary', 'fundus', 'retinal pigment epithelium', 'myocardial', 'exon 9', 'codon 1444', 'Extra-abdominal', 'abdominal']","['abdominal pain', 'abdominal distention', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'bloody stools', 'abdominal distention', 'anal bleeding', 'hemorrhoids', 'died', 'polyposis coli', 'abdominal distention', 'hypoactive bowel sounds', 'intra-abdominal mass', 'peritoneal signs', 'osteomatosis', 'osteomatosis of the right mandible', 'sebaceous cysts', 'subcutaneous fibromas', 'intestinal sounds', 'distention', 'abdominal contraction', 'acute abdomen', 'leukocytosis', 'anemia', 'mass', 'necrotic lesions', 'mass', 'decreased internal circulation', 'measurable velocity', 'intra-abdominal neoplastic mass', 'mass', 'tumor', 'tumor displaced', 'diaphragmatic hernia', 'hypodense enlargement of the right adrenal', 'adrenal adenoma', 'polyps', 'neoplasmatic mass', 'abdominal tumor', 'polyps', 'familial polyposis', 'adrenal adenoma', 'cholelithiasis', 'biliary obstruction', 'black spots of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium', 'Gardner syndrome', 'died', 'myocardial infarction', 'AMI', 'desmoid tumor', 'Mutation', 'Extra-abdominal manifestations', ""Gardner's syndrome"", 'abdominal mass', 'desmoid tumor']",['gastrographin'],"['41', 'Emergency Department', 'Gardner', '12th']","['surgical operation', 'physical examination', 'blood analysis', 'WBC', 'neutrophils', 'Hct', 'Hb', 'Abdominal ultrasound', 'Triplex study of the mass', 'abdominal CT scan', 'contrast medium infusion', 'Sigmoidoscopy up to 20 cm', 'surgically treated', 'abdominal tumor was resected, along with the involved parts of the small intestine and the right colon', 'excised right colon', 'adrenal adenoma was also resected', 'cholecystectomy', 'ophthalmologic examination of the fundus', 'Full length colonoscopy', 'histological examination', 'cytogenetic studies', 'APC mutation analysis', 'Computed tomography']","['last month', '4 years ago', 'Postoperative', 'three months later']"

The lymphoma was diagnosed 7 years prior to transplant, and was treated with different chemotherapy agents, including Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP regimen) and rituximab. Following relapse, he underwent autologous HSCT following a conditioning regimen with carmustine (BCNU), etoposide, adriamycin, and melphalan (BEAM). Neutrophil engraftment occurred on day nine. Antimicrobial prophylaxis included valacyclovir, fluconazole, levofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The patient was not taking steroids or other immunosuppressive medicines at this time.
Past medical and social history was unremarkable. There was no significant occupational exposure history. Patient was noted to have elevated eosinophil count (17% eosinophils; absolute count 0.970 × 109/L) on several occasions, three months prior to the transplant.
On physical examination, his temperature was 37.7°C, heart rate 85/min, respiratory rate 16/min, blood pressure 110/66 mm Hg, and pulse oximetry 96% on room air. The respiratory, cardiovascular and abdominal examination was normal.
The white blood cell count was 7.2 × 109/L (67% neutrophils, 18% bands, 5% lymphocytes, 7% monocytes, 2% metamyelocytes, and 1% eosinophils), hemoglobin 11.6 g/dL, platelets 25 × 109/L. Serum chemistry was normal.
The patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with duodenal biopsy for persistent nausea and vomiting. The biopsy showed active inflammation, larval forms of Strongyloides stercoralis (Figure ) and stromal cells with rare cytomegalovirus inclusions. Stool microscopy for ova and parasites was negative. Intra venous immune globulin (IVIG), Ganciclovir, Foscarnet, Ivermectin 15 mg daily and thiabendazole 3 gm daily were started with relief of symptoms within three days.
Ten days later, the patient developed dyspnea, fever, and hypoxia. Bilateral crackles were noted on lung auscultation. His clinical status deteriorated rapidly developing hypotension and respiratory failure.
While on mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen, pH was 7.45; pCO2 33 mm Hg and pO2 120 mm Hg. Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutrophilia were noted (Table ). The chest x-ray showed diffuse airspace disease (Figure ). Echocardiogram was normal. Therapy with Meropenem, gentamicin, and vancomycin was initiated. Blood cultures later grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. Vancomycin was discontinued, while meropenem and gentamicin were continued with clinical improvement leading to extubation in four days.
Ten days later, he was reintubated for recurrent respiratory failure and ventilatory support using BiLevel mode was provided. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). High dose parenteral steroids were initiated.
The BAL fluid showed multiple larval forms of Strongyloides stercoralis (Figure ), 90% hemosiderin laden macrophages and later grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. The steroids were discontinued and patient was started on intravenous Ivermectin.
His pulmonary status continued to deteriorate. The patient developed pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema, and died of progressive respiratory failure and septic shock 14 days later.","[[52.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['abdominal', 'follicular', 'heart', 'respiratory', 'cardiovascular', 'abdominal', 'duodenal', 'lung', 'respiratory', 'chest', 'airspace', 'respiratory', 'alveolar', 'pulmonary', 'subcutaneous', 'respiratory']","['nausea', 'vomiting', 'abdominal pain', 'follicular lymphoma', 'lymphoma', 'relapse', 'unremarkable', 'occupational exposure', 'elevated eosinophil count', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'inflammation', 'larval forms of Strongyloides stercoralis', 'stromal cells', 'cytomegalovirus inclusions', 'ova', 'parasites', 'relief of symptoms', 'dyspnea', 'fever', 'hypoxia', 'Bilateral crackles', 'clinical status deteriorated rapidly', 'hypotension', 'respiratory failure', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'anemia', 'neutrophilia', 'airspace disease', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'clinical improvement', 'respiratory failure', 'alveolar hemorrhage', 'DAH', 'larval forms of Strongyloides stercoralis', 'hemosiderin laden macrophages', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'pulmonary status continued to deteriorate', 'pneumothorax', 'subcutaneous emphysema', 'died', 'respiratory failure', 'septic shock']","['Cyclophosphamide', 'doxorubicin', 'vincristine', 'prednisone', 'rituximab', 'carmustine', 'BCNU', 'etoposide', 'adriamycin', 'melphalan', 'valacyclovir', 'fluconazole', 'levofloxacin', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'Ganciclovir', 'Foscarnet', 'Ivermectin', 'thiabendazole', 'Meropenem', 'gentamicin', 'vancomycin', 'Vancomycin', 'meropenem', 'gentamicin', 'Ivermectin']",['52-year'],"['autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'HSCT', 'chemotherapy agents', 'CHOP regimen', 'autologous HSCT', 'conditioning regimen', 'BEAM', 'Neutrophil engraftment', 'Antimicrobial prophylaxis', 'steroids', 'immunosuppressive medicines', 'eosinophils', 'absolute count', 'physical examination', 'temperature', 'heart rate', 'respiratory rate', 'blood pressure', 'pulse oximetry', 'white blood cell count', 'neutrophils', 'bands', 'lymphocytes', 'monocytes', 'metamyelocytes', 'eosinophils', 'hemoglobin', 'platelets', 'Serum chemistry', 'esophagogastroduodenoscopy', 'EGD', 'duodenal biopsy', 'biopsy', 'Stool microscopy for ova and parasites', 'Intra venous immune globulin', 'immune globulin', 'IVIG', 'mechanical ventilation', 'oxygen', 'pH', 'pCO2', 'pO2', 'chest x-ray', 'Echocardiogram', 'Therapy', 'Blood cultures', 'extubation', 'reintubated', 'ventilatory support', 'Bronchoscopy', 'bronchoalveolar lavage', 'BAL', 'parenteral steroids', 'BAL fluid', 'steroids']","['24 days', '24 days', '24 days', '7 years prior to transplant', 'on day nine', 'at this time', 'at this time', 'three months', 'prior to the transplant', 'three days', 'Ten days later', 'Ten days later', 'Ten days later', 'four days', 'Ten days later', '14 days later']"
396,1479808-1,16722556,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1479808.xml,Sutureless off-pump repair of post-infarction left ventricular free wall rupture,"A 47 year old man presented to the Emergency department with central chest pain. Lateral myocardial infarction (MI) was confirmed by typical changes in leads I, AVL and V6 and raised troponin T levels. The patient was not thombolysed. He was haemodynamically stable initially and a coronary angiogram was contemplated. However, before this could be performed, he developed further chest pain and became haemodynamically unstable with tachycardia, hypotension and collapse (at 48 hours). An urgent trans- thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a pericardial effusion. Left ventricular (LV) free wall rupture was suspected. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed which confirmed this, as well as a large pericardial effusion (figure ). He was transferred from the referring hospital to the nearest cardiothoracic centre (one hour journey) for surgical repair. On arrival, it was felt that he would not have survived a trip to the catheter lab. A peri-operative trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) demonstrated pericardial tamponade and left ventricular free wall rupture in the region supplied by the circumflex artery. Surgery was performed via a median sternotomy. A large amount of blood and clot was removed from the pericardium with immediate haemodynamic improvement. A large recent infarction was identified involving the obtuse margin of the heart. This part of the myocardium was typically oedematous and fragile. At the centre of the infarcted area blood spurted from a small hole in the left ventricular free wall. The pericardium was sutured bilaterally to the skin edges and the heart was gently lifted placing large swabs behind it for surgical exposure. Surgery was performed on the beating heart without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The LV wall defect was repaired with Gelatine-Resorcin-Formalin (GRF glue: Cardial, Saint-Etienne, France) applied to a 6 cm diameter bovine pericardial patch (Impra, Tempe, Arizona, USA). This sutureless technique was repeated four times using overlapping patches of bovine pericardium to ensure coverage of the surrounding infarcted area of the left ventricular free wall. After ensuring adequate hemostasis, the heart was replaced into the pericardial sac. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP, Datascope, Oakland, NJ, USA) was inserted electively after the procedure to reduce cardiac after-load. Post-operatively, the patient returned to the intensive therapy unit in a stable condition without inotropic support. The patient was successfully extubated twelve hours post-operatively and remained haemodynamically stable. Loss from the chest drains was modest (440 mls in 24 hours). The IABP was removed two days after surgery. The rest of the post-operative course was uneventful. There was no evidence of end-organ injury. A pre-discharge trans-thoracic echocardiogram did not show any leak of blood across the ventricular repair. There was minimal pericardial effusion and moderate left ventricular ejection fraction with no valvular abnormalities. The patient was discharged home on the fifth post-operative day. Subsequent investigation with coronary angiogram and magnetic resonance imaging scan have shown complete occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery. Irregularities were seen in the left anterior and right coronary arteries but there were no significant stenoses in these vessels. The obtuse margin of the heart was akinetic and the left ventricle was dilated with overall moderate function. At eighteen month follow up the patient is clinically well being active and experiencing only mild dyspnoea on exertion (NYHA II).","[[47.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['central chest', 'Lateral myocardial', 'coronary', 'chest', 'thoracic', 'pericardial', 'Left ventricular', 'Left ventricular (LV) free wall', 'LV', 'chest', 'pericardial', 'trans-oesophageal', 'TOE', 'pericardial', 'left ventricular free wall', 'region supplied by the circumflex artery', 'pericardium', 'obtuse margin of the heart', 'part of the myocardium', 'pericardium', 'skin edges', 'heart', 'heart', 'cardiopulmonary', 'LV wall', 'bovine pericardial', 'bovine pericardium', 'pericardium', 'left ventricular free wall', 'heart', 'pericardial sac', 'intra-aortic', 'cardiac', 'chest', 'end-organ', 'trans-thoracic', 'ventricular', 'pericardial', 'left ventricular', 'valvular', 'coronary', 'circumflex', 'circumflex coronary artery', 'left anterior and right coronary arteries', 'coronary', 'vessels', 'obtuse margin of the heart', 'left ventricle']","['central chest pain', 'Lateral myocardial infarction', 'MI', 'typical changes in leads I, AVL and V6', 'raised troponin T levels', 'thombolysed', 'haemodynamically stable', 'chest pain', 'haemodynamically unstable', 'tachycardia', 'hypotension', 'collapse', 'pericardial effusion', 'Left ventricular (LV) free wall rupture', 'pericardial effusion', 'pericardial tamponade', 'left ventricular free wall rupture', 'blood', 'clot', 'haemodynamic improvement', 'infarction', 'oedematous', 'fragile', 'blood spurted', 'beating heart', 'LV wall defect', 'LV wall defect was repaired', 'infarcted area of the left ventricular free wall', 'hemostasis', 'stable condition', 'haemodynamically stable', 'Loss from the chest drains', 'uneventful', 'end-organ injury', 'leak of blood across the ventricular repair', 'pericardial effusion', 'left ventricular ejection fraction', 'valvular abnormalities', 'complete occlusion of the circumflex', 'complete occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery', 'Irregularities', 'stenoses', 'obtuse margin of the heart was akinetic', 'akinetic', 'left ventricle was dilated', 'overall moderate function', 'moderate function', 'clinically well being active', 'dyspnoea on exertion']",['Gelatine-Resorcin-Formalin'],"['47', 'Emergency department', 'nearest cardiothoracic centre', 'Arizona', 'intensive therapy unit']","['troponin T levels', 'coronary angiogram', 'trans- thoracic echocardiogram (TTE)', 'thoracic echocardiogram (TTE)', 'Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest', 'surgical repair', 'catheter lab', 'trans-oesophageal echocardiogram', 'Surgery', 'large amount of blood and clot was removed from the pericardium', 'pericardium was sutured bilaterally to the skin edges', 'heart was gently lifted placing large swabs behind it for surgical exposure', 'Surgery was performed on the beating heart without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass', 'GRF glue: Cardial, Saint-Etienne, France) applied to a 6 cm diameter bovine pericardial patch', 'heart was replaced into the pericardial sac', 'intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP, Datascope, Oakland, NJ, USA) was inserted electively', 'procedure', 'inotropic support', 'extubated', 'IABP was removed', 'surgery', 'trans-thoracic echocardiogram', 'coronary angiogram', 'magnetic resonance imaging scan']","['at 48 hours', 'peri-operative', 'recent', 'Post-operatively', 'twelve hours', 'post-operatively', '24 hours', 'two days', 'post-operative', 'eighteen month']"

On reaching his twenties, having finished school and with a job and salary, he started to meet prostitutes. Episodes became more frequent and his need of compulsive sexual intercourse (up to 30 times in one day) was so intense that he could waste all his salary in just a few days. He developed a depressive episode requiring hospitalization in a day-hospital. The patient was diagnosed as suffering from C-ISBs and bipolar disorder of type II and was initially treated with sertraline (100 mg/d) and lithium salts (900 mg/d). After two months, the depressive symptoms had disappeared, but the patient refused to continue with the mood stabilizer because of significant weight gain (8 kilos). During the subsequent years he presented episodes of opposed polarity, with the presence throughout of C-ISBs, egodystonic when depressed and egosyntonic when euphoric, but he could not take any of the prescribed mood stabilizers, including valproate, carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, lamotrigine, or gabapentin, because of various side effects.
His most recent severe depressive episode occurred in the autumn of 2002: he had been depressed after spending his entire salary in just one day with prostitutes, and, on that occasion, had expressed suicidal intention. He was treated with benzodiazepines (only in the first week) and citalopram 20 mg/d, titrated up to 60 mg/d in two weeks. Then adjunctive topiramate was added to his current treatment at an initial dosage of 50 mg, which was titrated up to 200 mg/d in one month. After three months of this pharmacological regimen, depressive symptoms and sexual urges were significantly decreased and citalopram was reduced progressively until cessation. The patient was maintained on topiramate only which, given the mild mood shifts, was increased to 400 mg/d and continued for one year, with no relevant side-effects. During this period the patient experienced for the first time in his life a long period of stability with a normal arousal pattern, and he began a loving relationship which is still ongoing.","[[32.0, 'year']]",M,2006,[],"['C-ISBs', 'hypersexuality', 'repetitive masturbation', 'sexual intercourse', 'need of compulsive sexual intercourse', 'depressive episode', 'C-ISBs', 'bipolar disorder', 'depressive symptoms', 'weight gain', 'opposed polarity', 'C-ISBs', 'egodystonic', 'depressed', 'egosyntonic', 'euphoric', 'side effects', 'depressive episode', 'depressed', 'suicidal intention', 'depressive symptoms', 'sexual urges', 'mood shifts', 'side-effects', 'stability', 'normal arousal pattern']","['sertraline', 'lithium salts', 'valproate', 'carbamazepine', 'oxcarbamazepine', 'lamotrigine', 'gabapentin', 'citalopram', 'topiramate', 'citalopram', 'topiramate']","['A', '32', 'autumn of 2002']","['mood stabilizer', 'mood stabilizers', 'benzodiazepines', 'treatment', 'pharmacological regimen']","['After two months', 'in the autumn of 2002', 'first week']"

According to her accompanying spouse, three days prior she had eaten out and had one episode of diarrhea. Since then she had slowly become increasingly 'confused', as she described it. She had trouble finding the right words and had been using incorrect words in sentences. M.J. seemed untroubled by this change. These symptoms were accompanied by mild anorexia.
M.J. had a no significant previous medical history. She had no recent illnesses. She had experienced two vaginal births, and in true family medicine fashion, one of the medical team taking care of the patient had delivered her grandson about one year ago.
The patient emigrated from Germany thirty years ago, and English was her second language. She resided in a medium-sized northern New England town with her husband. She operated a daycare out of her home, with approximately five pre-school aged children, none of whom had recently had any serious illnesses.
On initial presentation to the Emergency Department, M.J. had no elevation in temperature. She had a mild frontal headache. Her vital signs were otherwise within normal limits. Her physical exam showed her to be alert and oriented, but with mild dysnomia on questioning. She did not have meningeal signs, but appeared mildly dehydrated. An initial computed tomography scan of the head (with and without contrast) was unremarkable for mass or bleed. However, it showed a moderate left-sided sphenoid sinusitis. Her leukocyte count, electrolytes, liver transaminases, folate, B12 and thyroid stimulating hormone were within normal limits.
She was admitted with intravenous fluids and intravenous ceftriaxone as empiric antibiotic coverage. An otolaryngology consult was obtained to determine whether the mental status changes could be attributed to the sinus findings. Throughout the next day, the patient became increasingly aphasic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was ordered and a lumbar puncture was performed. The fluid showed a leukocyte count of 75 and an erythrocyte count of 5, with a lymphocytic predominance (75%). The MRI showed left temporal lobe enhancement. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was sent for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, as well as for viral cultures. While this was pending, the patient was empirically started on intravenous acyclovir for presumed herpes encephalitis.
The patient required transfer to the intensive care unit soon thereafter for airway protection, where she continued her antiviral medication. PCR testing of the spinal fluid confirmed the presence of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). M.J. spent three weeks in acute rehabilitation after her hospitalization. She was treated with intravenous acyclovir for four weeks and oral valacyclovir for an additional three weeks. M.J. has required longer term speech therapy; however, she has returned to fully independent living.
In our patient's case, the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis was first raised by the cerebrospinal fluid findings, strongly indicated by the information added by the MRI, and confirmed by the PCR testing. HSV encephalitis is an uncommon illness, with about 2 cases per 250,000 per year [,]. Most are caused by HSV-1, with 10% having HSV-2 as the etiologic factor. An MRI is abnormal in the majority of PCR-positive cases []. PCR itself has a reported sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 94% for the detection of HSV in the CSF []. In general, the treatment for HSV encephalitis is to initially treat with intravenous acyclovir for 21 days [,], with a further period of oral antiviral medication as clinically indicated. Untreated, this particular encephalitis has a high case-fatality rate, of around 70% []. Even if it is treated in a timely fashion, the prognosis is only fair: approximately 40–50% would be expected to make full neurological recovery [,].","[[59.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['mental status', 'vaginal', 'frontal', 'meningeal', 'head', 'left-sided sphenoid', 'liver', 'mental status', 'sinus', 'brain', 'lumbar', 'left temporal lobe', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'airway', 'spinal fluid', 'cerebrospinal', 'neurological']","['mental status changes', 'diarrhea', 'confused', 'trouble finding the right words', 'using incorrect words in sentences', 'untroubled by this change', 'anorexia', 'illnesses', 'vaginal births', 'delivered', 'illnesses', 'elevation in temperature', 'frontal headache', 'alert', 'oriented', 'dysnomia', 'meningeal signs', 'dehydrated', 'mass', 'bleed', 'left-sided sphenoid sinusitis', 'liver transaminases, folate, B12 and thyroid stimulating hormone were within normal limits', 'mental status changes', 'sinus findings', 'aphasic', 'left temporal lobe enhancement', 'herpes encephalitis', 'Herpes simplex virus', 'HSV-1', 'fully independent living', 'HSV encephalitis', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'HSV encephalitis', 'HSV-1', 'HSV-2', 'HSV', 'HSV encephalitis', 'encephalitis', 'prognosis is only fair']","['fluids', 'ceftriaxone', 'acyclovir', 'acyclovir', 'valacyclovir', 'acyclovir']","['M.J.', '59', 'emergency room', 'a tertiary care center', 'M.J.', 'Germany', 'medium-sized northern New England', 'Emergency Department', 'M.J.', 'intensive care unit']","['temperature', 'vital signs', 'physical exam', 'computed tomography scan of the head (with and without contrast)', 'leukocyte count', 'electrolytes', 'liver transaminases', 'folate', 'B12', 'thyroid stimulating hormone', 'empiric antibiotic coverage', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain', 'lumbar puncture', 'fluid', 'leukocyte count', 'erythrocyte count', 'lymphocytic predominance', 'MRI', 'cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)', 'polymerase chain reaction (PCR)', 'polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis', 'viral cultures', 'airway protection', 'antiviral medication', 'PCR testing of the spinal fluid', 'acute rehabilitation', 'speech therapy', 'MRI', 'PCR testing', 'MRI', 'PCR-positive', 'PCR', 'sensitivity', 'specificity', 'treatment', 'antiviral medication']","['three day', 'three days', 'prior', 'one year ago', 'recently', 'next day']"

The past medical history was unremarkable. In clinical examination clear vesicular asymptomatic lesions were found on the attached and marginal gingiva in canine area. He had no previous dental history relating to the lesion in those sites and lesions were appeared gradually from two years ago. No other lesion and alteration could be detected radiographically and clinically. Excisional biopsies were taken from both lesions and the specimens were sent to the Department of Oral Pathology of Tehran University of Medical Sciences for microscopic examination.
Microscopic evaluation revealed gingival tissue covered by parakeratinized squamous epithelium. Deep to the epithelium multiple dilated lymph vessels with different sizes were observed in a little loose fibrovascular tissue.

She had undergone a physical examination and laboratory tests during the prior year with normal results. (These normal laboratory results are no longer available.) She was treated with surgery and 12 courses of cisplatin, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide. Several months after finishing her chemotherapy, she developed right-sided facial and arm twitching (possible seizures suggested by a neurologist), carpopedal spasm, and paresthesias in extremities. Head CT and EEG were normal. Laboratory tests showed hypokalemia (2.5 mEq/l), hypocalcemia (7.8 mg/dl), and hypomagnesemia (0.2 mg/dl). From1986 to 2003, she noted muscle aches and fatigue. Her plasma K+ levels ranged from 1.2 to 7.2 mEq/l (n = 44 measurements; 23 values = 3.5 mEq/L), and her Mg++ level ranged from 0.2 to 2.4 mg/dl. (n = 44 measurements; 43 values < 2.1 mEq/L). She required daily treatment with oral KCL 20–80 mEq, Mg oxide 200–2,400 mg, amiloride 5–20 mg, and spironolactone 100–200 mg to maintain her electrolytes in or near the normal range. She was admitted for IV potassium administration one time in 2002.
In April and August 2003, she had two episodes of hypokalemic paralysis; plasma K+ levels were 1.2 and 1.6 mEq/l despite taking oral KCL 80 mEq daily. She was then placed on IV potassium 20 mEq and oral KCL 160 mEq daily. In August 2003, her Mg++ level was 1.0 mg/dl on oral Mg oxide 4000 mg daily, and she was started on IV magnesium sulfate 4 grams weekly.
In January 2004 she presented to our clinic to establish a new primary care physician. She had muscle aches, diarrhea, paresthesias, and depression. She denied vomiting and diuretic use. She has had diabetes mellitus for 2 years. There was no family history of any electrolyte disorders. Her medications included magnesium sulfate 4 grams IV weekly, and daily oral KCL 240 mEq, amiloride 5 mg, aldactone 150 mg and avandia 8 mg. Her height was 158 cm; weight 74.1 kg; BMI 29.6; blood pressure 100/80 mm Hg; and pulse 80/min. Her physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory data are listed in Table . Her renal ultrasound was normal and had no nephrocalcinois. Urine screen for thiazide and loop diuretics was negative.
Her laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of Gitelman's syndrome, including hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalciuria and metabolic alkalosis. She has been seen in our clinic for 18 months with persistent fatigue and occasional muscle aches. She now takes daily oral Mg oxide 3,500 mg, KCL 60 mEq, and aldactone 150 mg to maintain serum Mg++ and K +levels in the normal range.","[[42.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['ovarian', 'right-sided facial', 'arm', 'carpopedal', 'extremities', 'Head', 'muscle', 'muscle', 'renal', 'muscle']","['ovarian cancer', 'normal laboratory', 'twitching', 'seizures', 'carpopedal spasm', 'paresthesias', 'hypokalemia', 'hypocalcemia', 'hypomagnesemia', 'muscle aches', 'fatigue', 'hypokalemic paralysis', 'muscle aches', 'diarrhea', 'paresthesias', 'depression', 'vomiting', 'diuretic use', 'diabetes mellitus', 'electrolyte disorders', 'nephrocalcinois', 'Gitelman', ""Gitelman's syndrome"", 'hypomagnesemia', 'hypokalemia', 'hypocalciuria', 'metabolic alkalosis', 'fatigue', 'muscle aches']","['cisplatin', 'adriamycin', 'cyclophosphamide', 'KCL', 'Mg oxide', 'amiloride', 'spironolactone', 'potassium', 'KCL', 'potassium', 'KCL', 'Mg oxide', 'magnesium sulfate', 'magnesium sulfate', 'KCL', 'amiloride', 'aldactone', 'avandia', 'Mg oxide', 'KCL', 'aldactone']","['42', '1986', '23', '2003', '2002', 'April and August 2003', 'August 2003', 'January 2004']","['physical examination', 'laboratory tests', 'laboratory', 'surgery', 'chemotherapy', 'Head CT', 'EEG', 'Laboratory tests', 'plasma K+ levels', 'Mg++ level', 'treatment', 'plasma K+ levels', 'Mg++ level', 'medications', 'height', 'weight', 'BMI', 'blood pressure', 'pulse', 'physical examination', 'Laboratory data', 'renal ultrasound', 'Urine screen for thiazide and loop diuretics', 'laboratory', 'serum Mg++ and K +levels']","['prior year', 'prior year', 'in 2002', 'April and August 2003', 'August 2003', '2 years', '18 months', '18 months']"

She also complained of stress incontinence, chronic constipation and recurrent intestinal and urinary infections. Her previous history was characterised by several congenital malformations, most of which had required surgical treatment. Neonatally, she had undergone anoplasty for an anorectal malformation with a rectovestibular fistula. Two months after birth, a laparotomy showed a hydronephrosis caused by obstruction of the ectopic right ureteral orifice, which had also caused megadolichoureter and recurrent urinary sepsis. A cutaneous ureterostomy was performed to improve renal function. However, two months later, she underwent a further laparotomy following an urography showing decreased renal function. Right nephrectomy was performed. The histological diagnosis was chronic pyelonephritis.
Furthermore, she had been diagnosed with right hand thumb torsion of the metacarpal-phalangeal articulation with hypotrophy of the tenar eminence, valgus and hemisacrum (type IV sacral malformation) [], and a bladder dysfunction that was treated pharmacologically. A standard karyotype on peripheral blood cells showed a normal female karyotype (46 XX) with no numerical or structural chromosomal abnormalities.
An ultrasound performed in our department showed a complex mass originating from the right pelvis that reached the right hypochondrium and the epigastrium. The transverse extension was more than 20 cm. Fluid was noted in the Douglas pouch. Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed a suspicious irregular polylobate complex mass of 24 × 19.5 × 13.5 cm; uterus and adnexa were not identified. Chest X-ray and CT were negative for pleural effusion or lung metastasis.
The patient underwent laparotomy. The three largest abdominal-pelvic masses and multiple smaller independent nodules within the peritoneum were progressively removed (Figure ). The three biggest masses were capsulated, predominantly solid, with cystic areas containing clear fluid, and had dimensions 17 × 12 × 9 cm, 11 × 5 × 5 cm and 14 × 13 × 12 cm. These samples were frozen and sectioned for assessment. On macroscopic examination of the excised masses, uterus and adnexa were not identified. The frozen sections showed a benign hypocellular tumour with myxomatous and oedematous stroma, with occasional spindle cells arranged in a storiform pattern. No malignant histological features were found.
Histological examination of the pelvic mass exhibited multiple smooth muscle-like nodules with low cellularity, no cytological atypia and few mitoses (Figure ). In some sections of the biggest mass, cervical and endometrial epithelia were detected. Immunohistochemical evaluation was strongly positive for desmin and actin (Figure ), oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) (Figure ), but negative for cytokeratin and EMA (Epithelial Membrane Antigen). All lymph nodes appeared to be seats of a non-specific reactive hyperplasia. Cytological examination of the peritoneal liquid revealed only reactive mesothelial cells and foamy histiocytes.
The final diagnosis, confirmed by two independent pathologists with expertise on smooth-muscle cell tumours, was LPD.
Among the features typical of CS, our patient presented only hemisacrum and anorectal malformation. These findings suggested that the patient might have harboured a pathological mutation in the HLXB9 gene. We therefore performed Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of the three exons, intron-exon boundaries, intron 2, and the entire 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of the gene. The amplified PCR products were sequenced and analysed using a CEQ2000XL DNA Analysis System (Beckmann Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). We identified no variations with respect to the reference sequence (GenBank accession number ), except for the variant *164^65insC in the 3' UTR. This variation was also present in pooled DNA from 10 healthy individuals, demonstrating that it is a benign polymorphism.","[[27.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['pelvic', 'intestinal', 'urinary', 'anorectal', 'rectovestibular', 'right ureteral orifice', 'ureteral orifice', 'urinary', 'renal', 'renal', 'right hand thumb', 'metacarpal-phalangeal articulation', 'tenar eminence', 'valgus', 'hemisacrum', 'sacral', 'bladder', 'right pelvis', 'right hypochondrium', 'epigastrium', 'Douglas pouch', 'abdomen', 'pelvis', 'uterus', 'adnexa', 'Chest', 'pleural', 'lung', 'abdominal-pelvic', 'peritoneum', 'uterus', 'adnexa', 'pelvic', 'muscle-like', 'cervical', 'endometrial', 'All lymph nodes', 'lymph nodes', 'peritoneal liquid', 'muscle', 'hemisacrum', 'anorectal']","['nulliparous', 'pelvic pain', 'amenorrhoea', 'stress incontinence', 'constipation', 'infections', 'congenital malformations', 'anorectal malformation', 'rectovestibular fistula', 'hydronephrosis', 'obstruction of the ectopic right ureteral orifice', 'megadolichoureter', 'urinary sepsis', 'decreased renal function', 'pyelonephritis', 'right hand thumb torsion of the metacarpal-phalangeal articulation', 'hypotrophy', 'sacral malformation', 'bladder dysfunction', 'standard karyotype', 'normal female karyotype', 'numerical or structural chromosomal abnormalities', 'mass', 'transverse extension', 'Fluid', 'complex mass', 'pleural effusion', 'lung metastasis', 'abdominal-pelvic masses', 'independent nodules', 'masses', 'cystic areas', 'excised masses', 'hypocellular tumour', 'myxomatous', 'oedematous stroma', 'spindle cells arranged in a storiform pattern', 'malignant histological features', 'pelvic mass', 'muscle-like nodules', 'low cellularity', 'cytological atypia', 'mitoses', 'mass', 'epithelia', 'desmin', 'actin', 'oestrogen receptor (ER)', 'cytokeratin', 'EMA', 'Epithelial Membrane Antigen', 'reactive hyperplasia', 'reactive mesothelial cells', 'foamy histiocytes', 'smooth-muscle cell tumours', 'muscle cell tumours', 'LPD', 'CS', 'malformation', 'pathological mutation in the HLXB9 gene', 'variations', 'variant', 'variation', 'polymorphism']",[],"['27', 'Gynaecology Unit', '7', 'Beckmann Coulter', 'Fullerton']","['surgical treatment', 'anoplasty', 'laparotomy', 'cutaneous ureterostomy', 'laparotomy', 'urography', 'Right nephrectomy', 'standard karyotype on peripheral blood cells', 'peripheral blood', 'ultrasound', 'Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis', 'Chest X-ray', 'CT', 'laparotomy', 'peritoneum were progressively removed', 'capsulated', 'samples were frozen and sectioned', 'macroscopic examination', 'frozen sections', 'Histological examination', 'Immunohistochemical evaluation', 'Cytological examination of the peritoneal liquid', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of the three exons, intron-exon boundaries', 'amplified PCR products', 'pooled DNA']","['7-month', '7-month', 'Two months after birth', 'two months later']"

Her medical history was significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and psoriasis. Physical examination revealed a palpable abdominal mass extending from the pelvis to above the umbilicus. It was firm in consistency and very suspicious for malignancy. Subsequent evaluation for serum tumor markers revealed an elevated CA125 (1017, reference range < 35). Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a large solid midline mass in the pelvis and lower abdomen, extending to above the umbilicus and measuring up to 19 cm. It had multiple areas of low attenuation within it. In addition, several hyperdense lesions were noted in the liver, measuring approximately 1–2 cm in diameter. A third lesion was present in the posterior part of the pelvis, was solid appearing, and possibly involving the right ovary. It measured 10 cm and was noted to be pressing on the inferior vena cava and the right lower ureter causing mild hydronephrosis.
She underwent a segmental resection of the ileum, along with a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salphingo-ophorectomy, and intraoperative needle biopsies of the liver masses. Histological examination revealed a large carcinoid in the ileum with metastasis to regional lymph nodes. The tumor was present as nests and sheets of uniform cells with focal gland formation (figure ). Cells contained modest amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and monotonous appearing nuclei with vesicular nucleoli (figure ). Focal areas of mucosal ulceration, as well as extensive perineural and vascular invasion were present. Metastatic deposits of carcinoid tumor were also found in both ovaries and in the liver.
A 24-hour urine specimen revealed predictably high levels of 5-HIAA (5 Hydroxy Indole Acetic acid) at 45.2 (reference range 0.5–9 mg/24 hours). The patient was followed regularly with 24-hour urine 5-HIAA levels and CT scans of abdomen and chest. Two years post diagnosis; mild progression of her liver disease was noted. The patient was initiated on subcutaneous octreotide (Sandostatin) at a dose of 50 mg/m2 twice daily.
She remained stable for three and one half years, when she discovered a lump in her left breast. Clinical examination revealed a firm mobile mass in the breast suspicious for tumor. Mammograms were significant for an irregular, marginated mass of 2.2 × 2.0 cm in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast. An ultrasound confirmed these findings, revealing a hypoechoic, irregularly marginated mass highly suspicious for malignancy. The patient underwent lumpectomy of the breast mass for a definitive diagnosis. The gross specimen had a tan grey firm nodule of 2.5 × 1.5 × 1.5 cm with smooth borders within otherwise unremarkable fatty tissue. Histological examination revealed a 2.5 cm nodule containing infiltrating cords and nests of cells morphologically similar to her original ileal carcinoid tumor. The larger nests demonstrated an acinar pattern with rosette formation. The cells contained round to oval nuclei with a fine reticular chromatin pattern (Figure and ). Necrosis was absent and mitoses were rare. Focally margins were positive for tumor. A partial mastectomy was performed to remove residual tumor. The patient received adjuvant radiation therapy to the affected breast. She has had no recurrences and has had stable liver disease (metastatic carcinoid) for 5 years following her breast surgery.","[[52.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['abdominal', 'abdominal', 'pelvis to above the umbilicus', 'abdomen', 'pelvis', 'lower abdomen', 'abdomen', 'umbilicus', 'liver', 'posterior part of the pelvis', 'right ovary', 'inferior vena cava', 'right lower ureter', 'segmental', 'ileum', 'abdominal', 'liver', 'ileum', 'regional lymph nodes', 'gland', 'mucosal', 'perineural', 'both ovaries', 'liver', 'abdomen', 'chest', 'liver', 'left breast', 'breast', 'upper inner quadrant of the left breast', 'breast', 'tissue', 'ileal', 'Focally margins', 'breast', 'liver', 'breast']","['postmenopausal', 'diarrhea', 'constipation', 'abdominal distension', 'hypertension', 'diabetes mellitus', 'psoriasis', 'abdominal mass', 'malignancy', 'midline mass', 'low attenuation', 'hyperdense lesions', 'lesion', 'pressing', 'hydronephrosis', 'liver masses', 'carcinoid', 'metastasis', 'tumor', 'focal gland formation', 'eosinophilic cytoplasm', 'monotonous appearing nuclei', 'vesicular nucleoli', 'Focal areas of mucosal ulceration', 'invasion', 'Metastatic deposits of carcinoid tumor', 'diagnosis', 'liver disease', 'lump', 'mobile mass', 'tumor', 'mass', 'mass', 'malignancy', 'breast mass', 'nodule', 'smooth borders', 'unremarkable fatty tissue', 'nodule', 'infiltrating cords', 'nests of cells', 'ileal carcinoid tumor', 'larger nests', 'nests', 'acinar pattern', 'rosette formation', 'cells contained round to oval nuclei', 'fine reticular chromatin pattern', 'Necrosis', 'mitoses', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'recurrences', 'liver disease', 'metastatic carcinoid']","['octreotide', 'Sandostatin']","['52', 'Nun', 'profession']","['Physical examination', 'serum tumor markers', 'CA125', 'Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen', 'segmental resection of the ileum', 'total abdominal hysterectomy', 'bilateral salphingo-ophorectomy', 'intraoperative needle biopsies of the liver masses', 'Histological examination', 'urine specimen', '5-HIAA', '5 Hydroxy Indole Acetic acid', 'urine 5-HIAA levels', 'HIAA levels', 'CT scans of abdomen and chest', 'Clinical examination', 'Mammograms', 'ultrasound', 'lumpectomy of the breast mass', 'Histological examination', 'partial mastectomy', 'partial mastectomy was performed to remove residual tumor', 'adjuvant radiation therapy', 'breast surgery']","['several days', 'several days', 'several days', '24-hour', 'Two years post', '5 years', '5 years']"

The patient was followed-up by computed tomography (CT), and there was no tumor at 1 year after the total gastrectomy. However, another year later, she was admitted to Wakayama Medical University hospital because of asymptomatic intra-abdominal tumor. Laboratory investigations revealed a hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.7 g/dl, while the levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were within normal range. CT showed a 50 × 65 mm round-shaped solid mass at the right side of the reconstructed jejunal pouch, which showed weak enhancement at arterial phase by contrast medium and local invasion into pancreas body (Figure. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a low signal intensity of the mass in both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images (Figure. ). Abdominal ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic mass without blood-flow.
At laparotomy, a 50 × 50 × 63 mm tumor was found to be located in the mesentery of the jejunal pouch which was used for reconstruction after total gastrectomy the mass was adhered to the pancreas and it was possible to separate it from pancreas. The tumor was excised and the reconstruction was performed by double tract method with esphagojejunostomy and jejunoduodenostomy. The resected specimen was shown in Figure. . Microscopically, the tumor was composed of spindle-shaped fibroblasts and copious collagen fibers by hematoxylin and eosin stain.

She had been aware of the slow-growing, painless swelling for over the past fifteen years. She had sought medical advice ten years before, but she had been unwilling to undergo surgery due to the fear of the postoperative morbidity. Clinical examination revealed a mobile, soft, and non-tender mass measuring 10 × 7 cm in size over the region of the left parotid and upper lateral neck area (Figure ). The surface of the mass was smooth and the overlying skin was normal without any signs of discoloration or tumor-adhesion. The facial nerve function was intact and the remainder of the head and neck examination was unremarkable.
The high-resolution CT scan showed an adipose tissue signal density mass arising from the left deep-lobe parotid gland that protruded inferiorly to the upper lateral neck (Figures ). A classic parotidectomy incision was made and the main trunk of facial nerve identified at the stylomastoid foramen. From the main trunk of the facial nerve, each branch in continuity is dissected away from the overlying superficial parotid lobe. Then a glistening yellow mass was identified in the deep lobe, closely associated with the lower branches of the facial nerve (Figure ). The tumor was well encapsulated and easily and totally enucleated after mobilization of the overlying facial nerve branches. Then the raised superficial parotid lobe was repositioned to cover the facial nerves before wound closure (Figure ). The surgical specimen was well encapsulated measuring 9 × 6 cm (Figure ). The histopathology examination revealed fibrolipoma, a histological variant of lipoma.

Investigations revealed a lesion in the left paravertebral and epidural region of the lumbar spine infiltrating the ipsilateral psoas without metastasis.
Because of exacerbated pain, the appearance of pariesis (difficulty with dorsal flexion of the foot) in her left leg and a large number of differential diagnosis, resection of the paravertebral mass was performed and a portacath was inserted. Histological examination showed a large B-cell lymphoma stage IE. Four cycles of chemotherapy were scheduled with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone in association with methotrexate and monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody. The patient tolerated the first cycle well; agranulocytosis appeared for 4 days (neutrophil count 180 g/l). The leg paresis subsided completely.
At admission for the second cycle of chemotherapy in September 2003, a transient pink macular rash appeared around the skin orifice of the implantable venous access device. No other clinical symptoms were present. Laboratory examinations revealed a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 29 mg/l and a left shift in the leukocyte count of 8%. This slight inflammation could not be explained by the lymphoma alone since previous CRP values were within the normal range. Blood cultures were performed. The rash disappeared spontaneously and the patient became asymptomatic.
Blood cultures were performed using an automated blood culture system (Bactec 9240 Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Instrument Systems, Sparks, MD, USA).
A positive aerobic blood culture vial was indicated after 3 days of incubation. Anaerobic cultures were negative. Gram staining was negative, but Acridine Orange staining revealed a spiral bacterium (figure ). Subculture of the positive vials was performed on blood agar plates and chocolate media incubated in a micro-aerobic (5% O2, 5 to 10% H2) and an anaerobic atmosphere at 35°C, generated with incubation jars in atmosphere generators (GENbox, bioMèrieux SA, Lyon, France). All subcultures remained negative after 5 days, therefore PCR and subsequent sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed on the positive broth. The definitive identification of H. cinaedi was achieved by sequencing the product of PCR based on the data of 16S rRNA comparing the nucleotide sequence homology with the GenBank database, where a 99.6% homology was found with H. cinaedi (accession number AF 426158). We used the following primer sequences: Primer b 162 5' GAG AGT TTG ATC XTG GCT CAG 3' (Microsynth GmBH) (-20°C). Primer BR-16SR 5' CGC TCG TTG CGG GAC TTA A 3'(Microsynth GmBH) (-20°C).
Additional blood cultures indicated the presence of the same micro-organism and empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 × 2 g/day and a catheter lock technique with gentamicin 5 mg/day was administered for 2 weeks.
Despite significant regression of all inflammatory parameters, control blood cultures remained positive for the same organism. The implantable venous access device was removed since an infection of the central vascular access was suspected in absence of another clinical symptoms. Cultures of the implantable venous access device remained negative but bacteremia persisted for another 4 days suggesting another source. However, no other source was found. A whole body computer tomography (CT) scan did not reveal any suspect lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed due to a headache, revealed an aneurysm, 8 mm in diameter, in the left posterior communicating artery (P2-P3). Coiling was performed with the placement of a detachable platinum coil, believed to be less susceptible to infections than other metals. Discussion arose whether this aneurysm could be of mycotic or congenital origin. No biopsy for histological analysis could be obtained and no previous cerebral images existed. The presence of an aneurysm in a region known for congenital aneurisms led us to diagnose a congenital origin.
After the intravenous treatment, an oral regimen of clarithromycin 2 × 500 mg/day followed by levofloxacin 2 × 500 mg/day was administered for 7 weeks.
The patient underwent three cycles of chemotherapy and 40 Gy of radiotherapy. In January 2004, the patient was considered to be in complete remission with good clinical evolution and she returned to work; the only complaint was symmetric arthralgia in the elbows and knees of unknown origin.
However, in March 2004, the patient was re-hospitalized due to a fever (39°C), shivering, watery diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, unproductive cough, and a diffuse, red, macular, patchy cutaneous rash all over the body with the exception of mucosal surfaces. The initial suspicion of a viral infection was revised 5 days later when a spiral gram-negative rod was detected in the blood cultures. The CD4 count revealed 290 cells/mm3 attributed to her chemotherapeutic immuno-compromised state. During this second episode of bacteremia, positive blood cultures again revealed a spiral, helical gram-negative rod (figure ). This time, subcultures were successful; colonies grew on blood agar incubated in a micro-aerobic (5% O2) atmosphere. Again, the identification of H. cinaedi was obtained by PCR and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.
Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of potentially active antimicrobials were determined on blood agar incubated micro-aerobically at 35°C with the E-test method for clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole and amoxicillin. Interpretation of susceptibility in vitro was based on the NCCLS guidelines for H. pylori for clarithromycin, and on published reports for metronidazole and amoxicillin [,]. For the other antibiotics, the interpretation was based on the NCCLS guidelines for gram-negative bacilli. The strain was susceptible to amoxicillin (MIC = 0.75 mg/l) and to metronidazole (MIC = 0.25 mg/l), intermediate to clarithromycin (MIC = 3 mg/l) and resistant to the other antibiotics tested (erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin).
After 2 weeks of successful intravenous ceftriaxone 1 × 2 g/day and peroral doxycycline 2 × 100 mg/day therapy, this regimen was changed to a peroral outpatient treatment. The patient received doxycycline 2 × 100 mg/day, metronidazole 3 × 500 mg/day and amoxicillin 3 × 750 mg/day for 2 months followed by doxycycline alone for a third month, following an empiric eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori. The patient had a good laboratory and clinical response.
Multiple examinations were repeated in order to detect the possible source of the recurrent infections, such as whole body CT scan, transesophageal echocardiography, bacterial stool cultures, colonoscopy with multiple biopsies, bone scintigraphy and cerebral angiographic MRI. No pathology, no recurrent neoplastic disease or cerebral aneurysms were found. An unspecific inflammation was seen in the colonoscopy without histological evidence of bacterial infection. This observation was attributed to the patient's post-irradiation status. Further investigations were abandoned due to the favorable progress under antibiotic therapy. The source of the recurrent infection could not be identified but was presumed to be either of endovascular or intestinal origin.
In November 2005, 19 months after the recurrence, the patient is in complete remission and in good clinical condition.","[[53.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['left leg', 'left paravertebral', 'epidural region of the lumbar spine', 'ipsilateral psoas', 'foot', 'left leg', 'paravertebral', 'leg', 'macular', 'around the skin orifice of the implantable venous access device', 'venous', 'central vascular access', 'whole body', 'left posterior communicating artery (P2-P3)', 'cerebral', 'elbows', 'knees', 'cutaneous', 'all over the body', 'mucosal surfaces', 'whole body', 'transesophageal', 'bone', 'cerebral', 'endovascular', 'intestinal origin']","['ischialgic pain', 'lesion', 'metastasis', 'pain', 'pariesis', 'difficulty with dorsal flexion of the foot', 'differential diagnosis', 'paravertebral mass', 'B-cell lymphoma', 'tolerated the first cycle well', 'agranulocytosis', 'leg paresis', 'macular rash', 'symptoms', 'inflammation', 'lymphoma', 'rash', 'asymptomatic', 'spiral bacterium', 'positive broth', 'H. cinaedi', 'H. cinaedi', 'regression of all inflammatory parameters', 'inflammatory parameters', 'infection of the central vascular access', 'symptoms', 'implantable venous access device', 'bacteremia', 'lesions', 'headache', 'aneurysm', 'aneurysm', 'mycotic', 'congenital origin', 'aneurysm', 'congenital aneurisms', 'congenital origin', 'complete remission', 'good clinical evolution', 'arthralgia', 'fever', 'shivering', 'diarrhea', 'vomiting', 'fatigue', 'cough', 'cutaneous rash', 'viral infection', 'spiral gram-negative rod', 'bacteremia', 'spiral', 'spiral, helical gram-negative rod', 'helical gram-negative rod', 'colonies grew', 'H. pylori', 'gram-negative bacilli', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'good laboratory and clinical response', 'infections', 'neoplastic disease', 'cerebral aneurysms', 'inflammation', 'bacterial infection', 'post-irradiation status', 'infection', 'complete remission', 'good clinical condition']","['cyclophosphamide', 'doxorubicin', 'vincristine', 'prednisolone', 'methotrexate', 'ceftriaxone', 'gentamicin', 'clarithromycin', 'levofloxacin', 'clarithromycin', 'ciprofloxacin', 'erythromycin', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'metronidazole', 'amoxicillin', 'clarithromycin', 'metronidazole', 'amoxicillin', 'amoxicillin', 'metronidazole', 'clarithromycin', 'erythromycin', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'ciprofloxacin', 'ceftriaxone', 'doxycycline', 'doxycycline', 'metronidazole', 'amoxicillin', 'doxycycline']","['53', 'August 2003', 'September 2003', 'Sparks', 'Lyon', 'France', '426158', 'January 2004', 'March 2004', 'November 2005']","['resection of the paravertebral mass', 'portacath was inserted', 'Histological examination', 'chemotherapy', 'monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody', 'neutrophil count', 'chemotherapy', 'Laboratory examinations', 'C-reactive protein', 'CRP', 'left shift in the leukocyte count', 'CRP', 'Blood cultures', 'Blood cultures', 'aerobic blood culture', 'Anaerobic cultures', 'Gram staining', 'Acridine Orange staining', 'Subculture', 'vials', 'subcultures', 'PCR', 'sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene', 'broth', 'PCR', '16S rRNA', 'GenBank database', 'homology', 'GAG', 'AGT', 'TTG', 'ATC', 'XTG', 'GCT', 'Microsynth GmBH', 'CGC', 'TCG', 'TTG', 'CGG', 'GAC', 'Microsynth GmBH', 'blood cultures', 'empiric antibiotic therapy', 'control blood cultures', 'blood cultures', 'implantable venous access device was removed', 'Cultures of the implantable venous access device', 'whole body computer tomography (CT) scan', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'Coiling was performed with the placement of a detachable platinum coil', 'biopsy', 'biopsy', 'histological analysis', 'cerebral images', 'treatment', 'regimen', 'chemotherapy', 'radiotherapy', 'blood cultures', 'CD4 count', 'chemotherapeutic immuno-compromised state', 'blood cultures', 'subcultures', 'blood agar incubated in a micro-aerobic (5% O2) atmosphere', 'PCR', 'sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene', 'blood agar incubated micro-aerobically at 35°C', 'E-test', 'vitro', 'antibiotics', 'MIC', 'MIC', 'antibiotics', 'therapy', 'regimen', 'outpatient treatment', 'empiric eradication therapy', 'examinations', 'whole body CT scan', 'transesophageal echocardiography', 'bacterial stool cultures', 'colonoscopy', 'biopsies', 'bone scintigraphy', 'cerebral angiographic MRI', 'pathology', 'colonoscopy', 'antibiotic therapy']","['4 days', 'September 2003', '4 days', 'March 2004', 'March 2004', 'March 2004', 'March 2004', 'March 2004', 'March 2004']"

He had the first episode of hematemesis and melena at the age of 11 years. He was managed elsewhere with 3 units of blood transfusion and endoscopic sclerotherapy for esophageal varices. He had his esophageal varices obliterated with 10 sessions of endoscopic sclerotherapy. He had an episode of recurrent UGI bleeding 9 months before presentation that was associated with hemodynamic instability, for which he received 4 units of blood transfusion and was subsequently referred to our centre. Additionally, he complained of a progressively growing lump in the left upper abdomen since the age of 3 years. He never had jaundice, ascites or encephalopathy. There was no history of any gum bleed, epistaxis, ecchymosis or prolonged bleeding from minor cuts. His general physical examination was normal; abdominal examination revealed a 6 cm non-tender smooth splenomegaly and a normal liver span. UGI endoscopy at AIIMS revealed 3 columns of grade II esophageal varices and gastric fundal varices. Duplex ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed a normal liver, splenomegaly and obliterated portal vein with multiple collaterals (portal cavernoma) in the hilum of the liver. Splenic vein calibre was 12 mm. Although his hemoglobin was normal (13 gm/dl) the hemogram revealed features of hypersplenism (low total leukocyte count: 2300/mm3 and low platelets: 70,000/mm3). Liver function tests, other than a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), were within normal limits (viz., serum bilirubin: 0.7 mg/dl, serum alkaline phosphatase: 190 U/dl, serum aspartate transaminase: 32 U/dl, serum alanine transaminase: 28 U/dl). PT, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and thromboelastogram (TEG) were significantly deranged (Table ). Assay for clotting factors revealed factor V deficiency (activity less than 20% of normal). Other clotting factor concentrations were normal and the screening for factor inhibitors was negative.
The possible problems during surgery with regard to excessive bleeding were explained to the parents and an informed written consent was obtained. A clinical haematologist saw the patient and a plan for pre and peri-operative FFP infusions with coagulation monitoring was decided upon. The patient was transfused 1500 ml of FFP the day before operation. Following transfusion the PT, APTT and TEG significantly improved (Table ), although they did not normalize. He was transfused 900 ml of FFP over 3 hours just before the start of the operation. He underwent splenectomy and proximal lieno-renal shunt (PLRS) through a left thoraco-abdominal incision (8th intercostal space) using a standardized surgical technique described by us previously []. The intra-operative blood loss was 1000 ml. During the operation he received two units of packed cells and 750 ml of FFP. The operative time was 4 hours and the patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. Postoperatively he received 600 ml of FFP every 12 hours for the first 48 hours followed by 450 ml of FFP every 12 hours for the next 48 hours. There was no bleeding from the drain sites and the wounds healed well without haematoma formation. Abdominal drain and chest tube were removed on 3rd and 8th postoperative days, respectively. Patient had high spiking fever ranging between 39°C–40°C in the initial postoperative period. Although the patient was initially started on i.v. amoxicillin with clavulinic acid and amikacin as per our protocol, antibiotics were changed to teicoplanin and piperacillin-tazobactam on the 3rd postoperative day. He became afebrile on the 6th postoperative day and intravenous antibiotics were continued till 10th postoperative day. Cultures from blood, urine and drain fluids were repeatedly sterile. An ultrasound evaluation did not reveal any subphrenic or intra-abdominal collection. He was discharged on the 12th postoperative day. Following discharge, at 4 months follow-up, the patient has had no recurrence of variceal bleeding and no evidence of hypersplenism (hemoglobin- 11 gm/dl, total leukocyte count- 6600/mm3, platelets- 325,000/mm33). A Doppler ultrasound study showed a patent lieno-renal shunt.","[[16.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['UGI', 'esophageal', 'esophageal', 'UGI', 'left upper abdomen', 'gum', 'abdominal', 'liver', 'UGI', 'UGI', 'esophageal', 'gastric fundal', 'abdomen', 'liver', 'portal vein', 'hilum of the liver', 'Splenic vein', 'Liver', 'proximal lieno-renal', 'left thoraco-abdominal', '8th intercostal space', 'drain sites', 'Abdominal', 'chest', 'subphrenic', 'intra-abdominal', 'variceal', 'lieno-renal']","['UGI bleeding', 'hematemesis', 'melena', 'esophageal varices', 'esophageal varices', 'UGI bleeding', 'hemodynamic instability', 'lump', 'jaundice', 'ascites', 'encephalopathy', 'gum bleed', 'epistaxis', 'ecchymosis', 'bleeding', 'cuts', 'splenomegaly', 'normal liver span', 'esophageal varices', 'gastric fundal varices', 'normal liver', 'splenomegaly', 'obliterated portal vein', 'collaterals', 'portal cavernoma', 'hypersplenism', 'factor V deficiency', 'bleeding', 'hemodynamically stable', 'bleeding', 'wounds', 'haematoma formation', 'fever', 'afebrile', 'collection', 'variceal bleeding', 'hypersplenism', 'patent lieno-renal shunt']","['amoxicillin', 'clavulinic acid', 'amikacin', 'teicoplanin', 'piperacillin-tazobactam']","['16-year', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, All India Institute of Medical Sciences', '11', 'centre', '3', '12th']","['blood transfusion', 'endoscopic sclerotherapy', 'esophageal varices obliterated', 'endoscopic sclerotherapy', 'blood transfusion', 'physical examination', 'abdominal examination', 'UGI endoscopy', 'Duplex ultrasound scan of the abdomen', 'Splenic vein calibre', 'hemoglobin', 'hemogram', 'total leukocyte count', 'platelets', 'Liver function tests', 'prolonged prothrombin time (PT)', 'prothrombin time', 'serum bilirubin', 'serum alkaline phosphatase', 'serum aspartate transaminase', 'serum alanine transaminase', 'PT', 'activated partial thromboplastin time', 'APTT', 'thromboelastogram', 'TEG', 'Assay for clotting factors', 'clotting factor concentrations', 'screening for factor inhibitors', 'factor inhibitors', 'surgery', 'FFP infusions', 'coagulation monitoring', 'FFP', 'transfusion', 'PT', 'APTT', 'TEG', 'transfused', 'splenectomy', 'proximal lieno-renal shunt (PLRS) through a left thoraco-abdominal incision (8th intercostal space) using a standardized surgical technique', 'intra-operative blood loss', 'packed cells', 'FFP', 'FFP', 'FFP', 'Abdominal drain and chest tube were removed', 'antibiotics', 'antibiotics', 'Cultures', 'blood', 'urine', 'drain fluids', 'ultrasound', 'hemoglobin', 'total leukocyte count', 'platelets', 'Doppler ultrasound study']","['9 months', 'since the age of 3 years', 'pre and peri-operative', 'day before operation', 'Postoperatively', '3rd and 8th postoperative days', '3rd postoperative day', '3rd postoperative day', '6th postoperative day']"

His graft had functioned well and his creatinine was stable at 130 μmol/l with an immunosuppressive regimen of cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisolone that he had received since his surgery. Over the past 6 months he reported a 6 kg weight loss and increasing nausea. He had also noted loose, darkish stools several times daily and significant night sweats but no fever. He denied having travelled outside of Germany in the past year. His nephrologists had noted small contracted native kidneys, an unremarkable graft and normal remaining abdominal structures in an ultrasound study. A gastroscopy, chest x-ray and urological evaluation were unremarkable. All tests conducted for infectious diseases were negative. The haemoglobin and hematocrit, liver enzymes, thyroid hormone levels and serum proteins were normal. His creatinine was unchanged and the C-reactive protein was 4 mg/dl. His nephrologists, who suspected an intestinal malignancy in this transplanted patient, referred him to our service for colonoscopy and further evaluation.
The physical examination, including neurological examination was unremarkable. The blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, the heart rate was 70/min. Our laboratory studies confirmed the ambulatory results. The cyclosporine level was in the therapeutic range. Serologic testing showed no signs of acute infection with adenovirus, Epstein-Barr Virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Borrelia. PCR for CMV-DNA was negative. A colonoscopy was performed but was only successful to the level of the proximal sigmoid colon. The examination was terminated because of pain and definite resistance the gastroenterologist could not pass. Other than scattered diverticuli, the mucosa was normal. We next scheduled a radiocontrast to visualize the colon. In this study a constricting lesion was encountered in the cecum which the radiologist identified as a typical sign of colon cancer (figure ). A computerized tomography was performed which showed a concentric wall thickening of the ascending colon about 3 cm above the cecum, which according to the radiologist, was consistent with the diagnosis of colon cancer (figure , panel a). All other abdominal organs were unremarkable otherwise or consistent with the earlier ultrasound examination. Before surgery another attempt at colonoscopy was scheduled. To our surprise, the second colonoscopy, performed with additional analgesia and sedation, revealed, a completely normal examination including the cecum. To address the obvious discrepancy between this result and the prior radiological findings we consulted another radiologist. She noticed that the radiocontrast study was performed with the patient lying prone (figure ). Moreover, she pointed out the proximity of the ascending colon to the renal graft as shown in the computerized tomography, performed in the supine position (figure , panel b). She suggested that with the patient in this position, the graft could squash the colon in such a fashion that the instilled radiocontrast agent would produce a constricting tumor-like image. With these new insights we were forced to start from scratch and to look for a different diagnosis explaining the patient's symptoms. During his hospital stay we had observed that the patient, although unremarkable in the general neurological examination, appeared slow and sometimes inappropriate. In a mini-mental examination we found a significant reduction in cognitive function. The neurologist also found no localizing signs, but additional psychomotor testing verified rapidly progressive early dementia. A magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain was performed, revealing an infiltrating, destructive, multilocular lesion in the frontal lobe, (figure ). The process was consistent with a malignant tumor and less suggestive of an infectious process. The patient was transferred to the neurosurgical section where a brain biopsy secured the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. Radiation therapy was started but over the course of the next few days the patient's general status deteriorated rapidly and he became progressively more somnolent. Radiation had to be stopped and 6 weeks after initial admission the patient died.","[[66.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['renal', 'native kidneys', 'kidneys', 'abdominal structures', 'chest', 'liver', 'thyroid', 'intestinal', 'neurological', 'heart', 'level of the proximal sigmoid colon', 'mucosa', 'colon', 'cecum', 'colon', 'wall', 'ascending colon', 'ascending colon about 3 cm above the cecum', 'colon', 'abdominal organs', 'cecum', 'ascending colon', 'colon', 'renal', 'renal graft', 'colon', 'neurological', 'brain', 'frontal lobe', 'brain']","['IgA nephropathy', 'graft had functioned well', 'weight loss', 'nausea', 'loose, darkish stools', 'night sweats', 'fever', 'small contracted native kidneys', 'unremarkable graft', 'normal remaining abdominal structures', 'infectious', 'infectious diseases', 'intestinal malignancy', 'unremarkable', 'infection', 'adenovirus', 'Epstein-Barr Virus', 'Chlamydia pneumoniae', 'Borrelia', 'CMV-DNA', 'pain', 'diverticuli', 'mucosa was normal', 'constricting lesion', 'colon cancer', 'concentric wall thickening of the ascending colon', 'concentric wall thickening of the ascending colon about 3 cm above the cecum', 'colon cancer', 'unremarkable', 'completely normal examination', 'proximity of the ascending colon to the renal graft', 'symptoms', 'unremarkable', 'appeared slow', 'slow', 'inappropriate', 'reduction in cognitive function', 'localizing signs', 'dementia', 'infiltrating', 'destructive', 'multilocular lesion', 'malignant tumor', 'infectious process', 'glioblastoma multiforme', 'general status deteriorated rapidly', 'somnolent', 'died']","['cyclosporine', 'azathioprine', 'prednisolone']","['66', 'Germany']","['renal transplant', 'creatinine', 'immunosuppressive regimen', 'surgery', 'ultrasound study', 'gastroscopy', 'chest x-ray', 'urological evaluation', 'tests', 'haemoglobin', 'hematocrit', 'liver enzymes', 'thyroid hormone levels', 'serum proteins', 'creatinine', 'C-reactive protein', 'transplanted', 'colonoscopy', 'blood pressure', 'heart rate', 'laboratory studies', 'cyclosporine level', 'Serologic testing', 'PCR for CMV-DNA', 'colonoscopy', 'colonoscopy', 'radiocontrast', 'computerized tomography', 'ultrasound examination', 'surgery', 'colonoscopy', 'colonoscopy', 'analgesia', 'sedation', 'radiological', 'radiological findings', 'radiocontrast study', 'computerized tomography', 'neurological examination', 'mini-mental examination', 'psychomotor testing', 'magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain', 'brain biopsy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation']","['seven years earlier', 'Over the past 6 months', 'Over the past 6 months']"

Her ECG at admission showed sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy and ST segment elevation in leads V4 to V6, which later normalized, without developing Q waves (Figure ). A fourth sound and a 4/6 systolic murmur along the mesocardium were noted in the physical exam. Twelve hours after the beginning of chest pain, creatin phosphokinase (CPK) 2.989 U/l and the CPK-MB fraction was 340 U/l.
The Doppler-echocardiogram showed a combination of asymmetric septal and mid-ventricular HCM (Figure ), and the anterobasal septum measured 21 mm. There was systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve with a subaortic gradient of 65 mm Hg (Figure ), anteromedial septal thickness was 19 mm, there was a mid-ventricular systolic gradient of 20 mm Hg and an apical aneurysm. Ejection fraction was 55%. The presence of a restrictive mitral flow indicated an increase in left ventricle end-diastolic pressure due to diastolic dysfunction.
The ECG at hospital discharge showed sinus rhythm, right bundle branch block (RBBB) with no Q waves, right ventricular hypertrophy and/or posterior necrosis (Figure ). The vectorcardiogram was consistent with apical necrosis (Figure ). The chest X-ray showed a mild increase in cardiothoracic index and the lower left arch.

She complained of palpitations lasting 20 to 30 minutes, and said she had had this problem for 2 years. Episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia were documented during an exercise stress test. She was treated with verapamil and metoprolol with no success. Her physical examination was normal and an echocardiogram revealed no structural abnormalities. Electrocardiography showed frequent monomorphic ventricular premature beats of left bundle-branch block and inferior axis configuration.
An electrophysiological study was performed with the patient in postabsorptive, non-sedated state. An EP Tracer electrophysiology system (Maastricht, The Netherlands) was used. During the study, sinus rhythm was very frequently interrupted by spontaneous repetitive monomorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardias (NSVT) with left bundle-branch block and inferior axis configuration. Mapping studies performed using an ablation catheter (Blazer II, Boston Scientific, USA) revealed that the ectopic activity originated from the RVOT. However, attempts to precisely map these premature depolarizations were frequently interrupted by a supraventricular tachycardia of cycle length 280 ms, which was started by the NSVT. The supraventricular tachycardia had a ventriculoatrial interval of 45 ms, which suggested either AVNRT or atrial tachycardia as the pathophysiologic mechanism.
Due to the frequent ventricular premature beats and runs of NSVT, it was not possible to further analyze and identify the exact nature of this supraventricular tachycardia. In order to continue mapping for the ventricular tachycardia, it was necessary to terminate the supraventricular tachycardia by overdrive pacing each time. There were occasions when the supraventricular tachycardia initiated the NSVT and vice versa (). An episode of NSVT during supraventricular tachycardia was observed to entrain the latter with a pattern compatible with AVNRT () [].
The ventricular tachycardia was eliminated after 14 radiofrequency applications (EPT, USA) were delivered to the RVOT. Ventricular programmed stimulation after the ablation revealed no inducible ventricular tachycardias and demonstrated that the ventriculoatrial conduction was decremental. Atrial programmed stimulation showed dual atrioventricular nodal physiology and inducible AVNRT.

411,1501081-1,16943982,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1501081.xml,Figure-8 Tachycardia Confined to the Anterior Wall of the Left Atrium,"A 57-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure, who had undergone aortic valve replacement 26 years ago, was referred to our department for a third attempt at radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation of an atrial tachycardia. According to reports, during the previous two electrophysiologic (EP) studies both a typical atrial flutter and a left atrial reentrant tachycardia (cycle length 190 ms) could be induced with burst pacing. Nevertheless, RF catheter ablation had failed in both cases, either because it was not possible to attain bidirectional block across the cavotricuspid isthmus (despite a large number of RF applications), or due to transformation of left reentrant tachycardia into atrial fibrillation during entrainment mapping and the impossibility of reinducing the same tachycardia after DC cardioversion. The patient continued to have frequent, prolonged episodes of palpitations despite several antiarrhythmic drug trials. Twelve-lead ECG documented an atrial tachycardia with a p-p interval of 240-280 ms and a variable degree of AV block as well as atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent several successful DC cardioversions for both arrhythmias. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed left atrial and ventricular enlargement, left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and mild mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
At the time of the third EP study, a decapolar catheter was placed in the coronary sinus (CS) and a bipolar catheter was positioned in the right ventricle. An 8-French deflectable quadripolar irrigated-tip catheter (Cordis-Webster, Thermocool, F-curve) was used for mapping and ablation. Mapping was performed using the Carto system (Carto; Biosense Inc). RF current was delivered through a Cordis Stockert generator between the 4-mm tip of the catheter and an adhesive patch on the posterior chest wall. Ablation was performed in temperature-controlled mode with a target temperature of 50°C and a power limit of 50 W. Saline was infused at a rate of 3 ml/min between ablations and 30 ml/min during RF current delivery. After obtaining a right atrial activation map with an electroanatomical reconstruction of the right atrium during proximal CS pacing, a regular tachycardia, with ECG morphology similar to the clinically documented tachycardia, was induced with burst pacing (). The CS electrograms were of low amplitude, with electrograms in CS 9-10 starting 23 ms before electrograms in CS 1-2.
Sequential mapping of the right atrium during tachycardia revealed a nonreentrant activation pattern with an early septal area. Mapping of the left atrium was performed through transeptal catheterization. Two discrete scars (areas with bipolar voltage ≤0.05 mV) (1-3) along with adjacent points displaying fragmented or double potentials were located on the left anterior wall. They were confined to a larger region of low voltage (≤0.5 mV). The entire cycle length of the tachycardia was recorded within this region and the activation map was consistent with a figure-8 circuit. We hypothesized that activation propagated craniocaudally, through a common channel bordered by two lines of double potentials in its upper portion (). In its inferior part this channel was bordered medially by a discrete scar. One loop then revolved medially, around a transverse line of double potentials and anterior to the ostium of the right inferior pulmonary vein. The second loop revolved laterally, through a channel bordered by the first line of double potentials and the second, lower, scar. A fourth possible channel appeared between the transverse line of double potentials and the medial scar. In order to avoid terminating or transforming the tachycardia or inducing atrial fibrillation, entrainment was not performed in this patient.
Ablation targeted the common isthmus (isolated RF applications) and both the common channel and the medial turnaround of the circuit (point-by-point and dragging technique, aiming also to transect the possible fourth channel). Both attempts failed due to poor catheter stability. With the aim of continuing the ablation procedure under coronary sinus pacing, we attempted to interrupt the tachycardia by overdrive pacing, but this maneuver led to transformation into a second tachycardia with a CL of 190 ms (not shown in this paper). This tachycardia was DC-converted to sinus rhythm and the procedure continued afterwards under CS pacing. Nevertheless, the same technical difficulties further precluded the successful ablation of the circuit. Remapping the ablation points confirmed persistence of electrograms with the same configuration and the procedure was interrupted (long procedure time).","[[57.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['heart', 'aortic valve', 'atrial', 'atrial', 'left atrial', 'cavotricuspid isthmus', 'atrial', 'atrial', 'AV', 'atrial', 'left atrial', 'ventricular', 'left ventricular', 'mitral', 'tricuspid', 'coronary sinus', 'right ventricle', 'posterior chest wall', 'right atrial', 'right atrium', 'CS', 'right atrium', 'septal area', 'left atrium', 'transeptal', 'left anterior wall', 'common channel', 'inferior part this channel', 'transverse line of double potentials', 'anterior to the ostium of the right inferior pulmonary vein', 'second loop', 'channel bordered by the first line of double potentials and the second, lower, scar', 'transverse line of double potentials and the medial scar', 'atrial', 'common isthmus', 'common channel', 'medial turnaround of the circuit', 'coronary', 'coronary sinus']","['dilated cardiomyopathy', 'chronic heart failure', 'atrial tachycardia', 'atrial flutter', 'left atrial reentrant tachycardia', 'burst pacing', 'bidirectional block', 'bidirectional block across the cavotricuspid isthmus', 'left reentrant tachycardia', 'atrial fibrillation', 'tachycardia', 'palpitations', 'atrial tachycardia', 'AV block', 'atrial fibrillation', 'arrhythmias', 'enlargement', 'systolic and diastolic dysfunction', 'regurgitation', 'proximal CS pacing', 'tachycardia', 'tachycardia', 'burst pacing', 'tachycardia', 'nonreentrant activation pattern', 'early septal area', 'scars', 'bipolar', 'fragmented', 'double potentials', 'entire cycle length of the tachycardia', 'activation map was consistent with a figure-8 circuit', 'activation propagated craniocaudally', 'common channel bordered by two lines of double potentials', 'inferior part this channel was bordered medially', 'scar', 'One loop then revolved medially', 'double potentials', 'second loop revolved laterally', 'channel appeared between the transverse line of double potentials and the medial scar', 'medial scar', 'terminating or transforming the tachycardia', 'atrial fibrillation', 'poor catheter stability', 'tachycardia', 'tachycardia', 'tachycardia', 'sinus rhythm']",['Saline'],['57'],"['aortic valve replacement', 'radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation of an atrial tachycardia', 'electrophysiologic (EP) studies', 'RF catheter ablation', 'DC cardioversion', 'antiarrhythmic drug trials', 'Twelve-lead ECG', 'p-p interval', 'DC cardioversions', 'Transthoracic echocardiography', 'EP study', 'decapolar catheter was placed in the coronary sinus (CS)', 'bipolar catheter was positioned in the right ventricle', '8-French deflectable quadripolar irrigated-tip catheter (Cordis-Webster, Thermocool, F-curve) was used for mapping and ablation', 'mapping', 'ablation', 'Mapping was performed using the Carto system (Carto; Biosense Inc)', 'RF current was delivered through a Cordis Stockert generator between the 4-mm tip of the catheter and an adhesive patch on the posterior chest wall', 'Ablation', 'ablations', 'right atrial activation map', 'electroanatomical reconstruction of the right atrium', 'ECG morphology', 'CS electrograms', 'electrograms in CS 9-10', 'electrograms in CS 1-2', 'Sequential mapping of the right atrium', 'Mapping of the left atrium', 'entrainment', 'Ablation targeted the common isthmus (isolated RF applications) and both the common channel and the medial turnaround of the circuit', 'ablation procedure under coronary sinus pacing', 'coronary sinus pacing', 'overdrive pacing', 'CL', 'procedure', 'CS pacing', 'ablation of the circuit', 'electrograms', 'procedure']",['26 years ago']

He had a past medical history significant for aortic stenosis, status post aortic valve replacement, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and sick sinus syndrome, for which a DDD pacemaker was placed. Two days prior to admission he noted light-headedness, which began while walking.
Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) (), revealed a wide complex tachycardia at 170 bpm with LBBB morphology. The differential diagnosis included ventricular tachycardia with exit block, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, and A-V nodal reentrant tachycardia. Previous tracings had shown a preexisting LBBB.
The tachycardia terminated spontaneously but recurred. After the resolution of symptoms, the ECG was repeated (). This ECG showed a QRS morphology similar to the admission tracing with a ventricular rate of 85 bpm and no clear P wave activity.
Because the follow up ECG was at a rate exactly half the initial one, an underlying atrial tachycardia was suspected. The pacemaker was interrogated to assist in analysis of the rhythm (). The interrogation revealed atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block, with an atrial rate of 170 bpm and a ventricular rate of 85 bpm.

The hand and digits were pale in color and dry on the dorsum, suggesting deep, partial-thickness burns (Fig ). The injury was progressively more superficial proximally on the extremity. The clinical impression of 3 surgeons with experience in burn care was that the distal portion of the burn, ie, hand and forearm, would require excision and grafting.
After cleaning the wound, the decision was made to treat the hand and distal forearm with subatmospheric pressure (V.A.C., KCI, Inc, San Antonio, Tex) and to apply silver sulfadiazine more proximally. The sponge was applied directly to the burned skin without additional interface at approximately 6 hours after injury. The dressing was maintained at a continuous negative pressure of 125 mm Hg over the next 40 hours, with interruption only for routine clinical evaluation at 5, 16, and 24 hours after initiation of treatment. This was accomplished by opening the dressing without completely changing it. The treatment was tolerated well by the patient, requiring no excessive pain medication. After the subatmospheric pressure treatment was stopped, the patient was started on twice daily applications of silver sulfadiazine.
The clinical impression at this time was that the hand burn had not progressed but had stabilized and had minimal edema (Fig ). However, it was now of indeterminate depth.
The patient was started on hand therapy, and the hand was kept elevated. The wound continued to epithelialize until it was clinically healed by Day 10, but the patient had received significant fingernail injury that persisted until the nail was completely replaced.
The patient was discharged home on the 12th postinjury day. He was followed as an outpatient and returned to work by October. At approximately 4 weeks, his skin not only was functional but also had an excellent cosmetic result (Fig ). In addition, the skin on the hand appeared more normal with less hyperemia than the skin of the shoulder, despite the fact that the hand had received the deepest burn consistent with the mechanism of surgery (Fig ).","[[26.0, 'year']]",M,2005,"['right upper extremity', 'face', 'hand', 'digits', 'dorsum', 'extremity', 'distal portion', 'hand', 'forearm', 'hand', 'distal forearm', 'skin', 'hand', 'hand', 'hand', 'fingernail', 'nail', 'skin', 'skin on the hand', 'skin of the shoulder', 'hand']","['flash burn', 'pale in color', 'dry', 'burns', 'injury', 'distal portion of the burn', 'wound', 'burned skin', 'injury', 'opening the dressing', 'treatment was tolerated well', 'tolerated well', 'hand burn', 'edema', 'wound', 'fingernail injury', 'functional', 'excellent cosmetic result', 'hyperemia', 'burn']","['silver sulfadiazine', 'sulfadiazine', 'silver sulfadiazine']","['August 2, 1995', '26', 'electrician', 'San Antonio', '12th']","['burn care', 'excision', 'grafting', 'cleaning the wound', 'subatmospheric pressure', 'sponge was applied directly to the burned skin', 'sponge was applied directly to the burned skin without additional interface', 'dressing was maintained', 'clinical evaluation', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'pain medication', 'subatmospheric pressure treatment', 'hand therapy', 'hand was kept elevated', 'nail was completely replaced', 'surgery']","['approximately 6 hours', 'at this time', 'Day 10', 'approximately 4 weeks', 'approximately 4 weeks']"

He was revascularized with 3-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting on 3/12/02 after he developed unstable angina. His post-operative course was complicated by a deep venous thrombosis. Treatment was initiated with warfarin and the patient was subsequently discharged from the hospital. He was readmitted three weeks later with mild shortness of breath. A ventilation/perfusion scan was negative for pulmonary embolism. However, while on telemetry, the patient had an episode of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. He underwent diagnostic electrophysiologic testing at which time he was inducible for ventricular tachycardia. On 4/2/02, an AICD was implanted. He was discharged without incident and did well for over a year without any arrhythmic event requiring ICD shock. One week prior to the current admission the patient noted a skin tear over the AICD with protrusion of the device to the anterior chest wall. He visited his cardiologist to evaluate the extrusion of the device at which time he was immediately referred for hospital admission.
The patient admitted to minimal skin tenderness over the site but denied bloody or purulent drainage, fevers, chills, or malaise. His medications included metoprolol XL 50 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, atorvastatin 10 mg daily, isosorbide mononitrate 20 mg daily, and gabapentin 300 mg daily. Social history, family history, and review of systems were non-contributory.
On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 97.8° F, blood pressure 122/78 mm Hg, pulse 86 beats per minute and regular, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. He was a well developed, well nourished male sitting comfortably in no distress. Examination of his neck revealed no JVD at 30°, normal carotid upstrokes without bruits, and no thyromegaly. His chest was clear and heart examination revealed a non-displaced point of maximal impulse with a normal apical impulse, normal S1 and S2 without an S3 or S4. His pulse was regular with an apical 2/6 holosystolic murmur with radiation to the axilla. His anterior chest wall revealed a well healed sternotomy scar with erythema in the left supraclavicular area at the point where his AICD was extruding from his skin without drainage (see and ). His abdomen was obese but soft without hepatomegaly. Neurologically, he was grossly intact. His lower extremities revealed no edema and distal pulses were intact. His initial laboratory results were normal including metabolic profile, complete blood count with differential, and coagulation profile. His chest radiograph revealed clear lungs, normal heart size, and a dual chamber pacemaker/defibrillator with leads in proper position. His electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a normal sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block, left posterior fascicular block, and an old inferior infarct. This ECG was unchanged from prior tracings. The patient was admitted to the hospital and three sets of blood cultures were obtained. He was subsequently started on vancomycin 1 g intravenously q 12h. The following day his device was explanted and the pocket debrided. Blood cultures as well as cultures from the device and surrounding skin and subcutaneous tissue revealed no growth. He was continued on antibiotics and discharged from the hospital without complications. The discharge plan was to replace the AICD at a future date, upon healing of the operative site.","[[65.0, 'year']]",M,2004,"['renal', 'peripheral arterial', 'coronary artery', 'myocardial', '3-vessel coronary artery', 'deep venous', 'pulmonary', 'ventricular', 'ventricular', 'skin', 'anterior chest wall', 'skin', 'over the site', 'neck', 'carotid', 'chest', 'heart', 'apical', 'anterior chest wall', 'left supraclavicular area', 'skin', 'abdomen', 'Neurologically', 'lower extremities', 'chest', 'lungs', 'heart', 'chamber', 'right bundle branch', 'left posterior fascicular', 'surrounding skin', 'subcutaneous tissue', 'operative site']","['chronic renal insufficiency', 'dyslipidemia', 'hypertension', 'peripheral arterial disease', 'coronary artery disease', 'myocardial infarction', 'angina', 'deep venous thrombosis', 'shortness of breath', 'pulmonary embolism', 'ventricular tachycardia', 'ventricular tachycardia', 'incident', 'did well', 'arrhythmic event', 'skin tear over the AICD', 'protrusion of the device to the anterior chest wall', 'extrusion', 'extrusion of the device', 'skin tenderness', 'drainage', 'fevers', 'chills', 'malaise', 'well developed', 'well nourished', 'sitting comfortably', 'distress', 'JVD', 'normal carotid upstrokes', 'bruits', 'thyromegaly', 'chest was clear', 'non-displaced point of maximal impulse', 'normal apical impulse', 'normal S1 and S2', 'S3', 'S4', 'pulse was regular', 'holosystolic murmur', 'sternotomy scar', 'erythema', 'AICD was extruding', 'drainage', 'obese', 'hepatomegaly', 'grossly intact', 'edema', 'distal pulses were intact', 'clear lungs', 'normal heart size', 'dual chamber pacemaker/defibrillator', 'dual chamber pacemaker/defibrillator with leads in proper position', 'leads in proper position', 'normal sinus rhythm', 'right bundle branch block', 'left posterior fascicular block', 'inferior infarct', 'growth', 'complications']","['warfarin', 'metoprolol', 'aspirin', 'clopidogrel', 'atorvastatin', 'isosorbide mononitrate', 'gabapentin', 'vancomycin']","['65', '1994', '3/12/02', '4/2/02']","['3-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting', 'ventilation/perfusion scan', 'telemetry', 'diagnostic electrophysiologic testing', 'AICD was implanted', 'ICD shock', 'medications', 'physical examination', 'temperature', 'blood pressure', 'pulse', 'respiratory rate', 'laboratory', 'metabolic profile', 'complete blood count with differential', 'coagulation profile', 'chest radiograph', 'electrocardiogram', 'ECG', 'ECG', 'blood cultures', 'device was explanted', 'pocket debrided', 'Blood cultures', 'cultures', 'antibiotics', 'replace the AICD']","['status post', '1994', '3/12/02', 'post-operative', 'three weeks later', '4/2/02', 'over a year', 'One week prior to the current admission']"

He had no structural heart disease. His previous medical records revealed several ECGs during arrhythmia all showing regular narrow complex tachycardia with a rate of 180beat/min. There was no documented wide complex tachycardia. During initial EP study a narrow complex tachycardia was reproducibly induced () which was shown to be typical AVNRT (). Another regular arrhythmia with RBBB and left axis morphology (cycle length=330 ms) and negative HV (-20 ms), compatible with ILVT was also induced reproducibly by ventricular programmed electrical stimulation (and). RF catheter ablation of AVNRT was done successfully. After ablation, the ILVT was still inducible. The patient received verapamil and remained asymptomatic.
As the ablation procedure was prolonged the ablation of ILVT postponed to another session. After one month the patient re-admitted for ablation of ILVT, three days after discontinuation of verapamil. Three quadripolar catheters (6F, Josephson, Bard Electrophysiology) were introduced via left femoral vein and positioned at RV apex (and right ventricular outflow tract), His bundle and high right atrium. A 7F steerable decapolar catheter (2-5-2 mm) was introduced via left femoral artery (Marinr, Medtronic Inc, USA) and positioned in LV on interventricular septum for recording intracardiac signals during sinus rhythm and tachycardia. This catheter was used as a guide for localization of earliest purkinje potential (PP) recording site by ablation catheter. A 7F ablation catheter (Conductr, Medtronic Inc, USA) was introduced via right femoral artery and positioned in LV on septum for mapping and subsequent RF ablation. The ILVT was terminated by mechanical pressure at earliest PP recording site (). RF energy was applied (50 W, 70°C, 60 s) from distal electrode of ablation catheter at this site during sinus rhythm.

Despite frequent occurrence of palpitation, she had no chance to capture any 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during palpitation. The only evidence of arrhythmia in this patient was a sustained SVT with heart rate about 185 beats/min recorded in one of her 24-hour holter monitoring. Two antiarrhythmic agents (propranolol, verapamil) were tried in our patient with no success.
The baseline standard 12-lead ECG showed no any abnormality. The physical examination and transthoracic echocardiography were unremarkable.
After obtaining of written informed consent, electrophysiological study (EPS) was done in post absorptive, and non-sedated state. All antiarrhythmic drugs were interrupted for at least five half-lives before procedure. Three 6F diagnostic catheters (Daig, St. Jude Medical Inc., Minnetonka, MN, USA) were inserted via left femoral vein and placed in the high right atrium (HRA), His bundle position, and right ventricular apex (RVA), respectively. A 7F decapolar catheter with 2/2/2 mm electrode spacing (Marinr® CS; Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) positioned retrogradely via right femoral vein into the coronary sinus (CS) for coronary sinus mapping. During programmed electrical stimulation (PES) from RVA, nondecremental retrograde conduction was seen with earliest atrial activity on the proximal pole of CS catheter (located at the ostium of CS). No ventricular preexcitation was observed on atrial incremental pacing, compatible with a concealed right posteroseptal (RPS) accessory pathway. During atrial extrastimulation, a sustained narrow complex tachycardia (cycle length=320 ms) was induced reproducibly with earliest retrograde atrial activity in the proximal CS (). This tachycardia easily terminated by overdrive ventricular pacing and timed ventricular extrasystole during His refractoriness advanced atrial activity.
Application of RF energy at right posteroseptal area resulted in loss of conduction over the accessory pathway (AP) (Figure 2A). Repeat ventricular PES revealed 1:1 vetriculoatrial conduction with earliest atrial activity on the HRA catheter, compatible with concealed right free wall (RFW) AP and atrial PES culminated in induction of a new narrow complex tachycardia (cycle length=340 ms) well-matched with orthodromic AVRT using RFW-AP (). Atrial advancement was also seen during the second AVRT (RFW). Mapping of tricuspid annulus localized the site of second AP on the posterolateral area. RF energy delivery at this area interrupted AP conduction () and VA conduction shifted to the normal pathway. Repeat PES under isoproterenol infusion leads to induction of a new narrow complex tachycardia (cycle length=360 ms) compatible with typical AVNRT (). AVNRT became noninducible after successful slow pathway (SP) ablation. During postablation arrhythmia induction under isoproterenol infusion, a sustained, self-terminating atrial tachycardia was induced but no attempt was made for ablation ().

He was diagnosed as having common cold and was referred to our hospital because of his electrocardiographic changes resembling acute coronary syndrome. He had no cardiac complaints and did not have a history of syncope or a family history of sudden cardiac death. On physical examination, the patient was dehydrated but alert. In the emergency room, his temperature was 38.3°C, the blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg and the pulse was 88 per min. There was an inflammation of the pharynx. No other abnormalities were found. Hematological and biochemical tests including cardiac enzymes and electrolytes were within normal limits and the chest X-ray was unremarkable.The white blood cell count was 9600/cu mm. There was no evidence of structural heart disease on echocardiographic examination. Later that day, the patient’s temperature was 36.9°C with antipyretics and electrocardiogram showed saddle-back type ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V2 (). Subsequently, drug challenge test with propafenone was performed; the ST-segment elevation changed from the saddle-back type () to the coved type (). The next day, the patient was afebrile and the incomplete right bundle branch block disappeared on electrocardiogram, which showed only minimal ST-segment elevation in V2 ().

The structural heart disease was excluded by physical examination and transthoracic echocardiography. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal cardiac chambers (including right ventricle), normal valvular function and ejection fraction (EF) without any wall motion abnormalities. During an episode of palpitation, the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed documented wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 125 beats /min. The tachycardia was refractory to two intravenous antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, procainamide). The wide complex tachycardia had inferior axis and right bundle branch block morphology compatible with LVOT-tachycardia (). The baseline ECG showed no abnormality.
After obtaining written informed consent, electrophysiologic study was done in the postabsorptive and nonsedated state. During programmed electrical stimulation from atrium and ventricle, dual AV nodal physiology with nonsustained AVNRT was induced. Then programmed ventricular stimulation was performed with standard protocol at three cycle length (600,500,400ms) and three extrastimuli up to coupling interval of 200 ms from two sites (RV apex, RVOT). No ventricular tachycardia was induced with and without isoproterenol infusion. Repeat programmed atrial stimulation resulted in induction of sustained AVNRT under isoproterenol infusion (). Radiofrequency catheter ablation of slow pathway was done at right posteroseptal area. Postablation programmed stimulation failed to induce any supraventricular tachycardia with and without isoproterenol infusion but a wide complex tachycardia (cycle length=480 ms) identical to clinically documented arrhythmia was induced by overdrive pacing from RVOT. Mapping of RVOT failed to show any early ventricular activation site, thus LVOT was mapped and tachycardia focus was localized in this area with 53 ms early ventricular activation relative to surface electrocardiogram () Radiofrequency energy delivery (50 W, 60°C) at this site resulted in termination of tachycardia ().

Clinical examination revealed multiple large thoracic and abdominal ""cafe-au-lait"" spots and the presence of a thoracic gibbous that was painful to pressure (Painful Rib Hump). Neurological examination revealed difficulty in gait, bilateral Babinski and ankle clonus, right drop foot, decreased superficial sensation, and increased tendon reflections in the lower limbs. Also the child complained of daytime uncontrolled micturitions. Plain radiographs showed a single, sharp, left thoracic kyphoscoliotic curve from T4 to T10 measuring 75° by the Cobb method with the apex at eighth thoracic vertebra. CT-scan revealed detachment and translocation of the cephalic end of the left eighth rib into the adjacent enlarged neural foramen. The costovertebral joint dislocation was at the apex of the curve on the convex side and the rib head was displaced into the spinal canal and compressed the spinal cord (Figure ). The M.R.I. examination of the spine revealed the spinal cord compression by the displaced rib head and showed no other cord abnormality or neurogenic tumor.
The patient underwent resection of the intraspinal mobile eighth rib head through a posterior approach and simultaneous correction and fusion of the kyphoscoliotic curve with posterior spinal instrumentation from T1 to L2.

At that time, the patient was free of complaints. On physical exam, atrophy of the vulva was seen but without evidence of lichen sclerosus. Approximately five millimeters from the clitoris, on the inner aspect of the left labium majus, a 1.5 cm indurated exophytic lesion was noted bleeding on touch (Figure ). There was no involvement of the urethra or vagina. No regional lymphadenopathy was noted at this time. Biopsy revealed keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. The patient had a previous history of recurrent adenocarcinoma within the oral cavity but had been free of disease for ten years.
Anterior radical vulvectomy without inguinal lymph node dissection was performed with margins of at least 2 cm from the well defined lesion. Frozen section biopsy revealed a depth of invasion of less than 1 mm. Histopathologic evaluation of the entire specimen showed a well differentiated 1.7 × 1.5 cm superficially invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (Figure ). The exophytic tumor had a thickness of 5 mm. The greatest depth of invasion was 0.08 mm using the criteria established by Wilkinson et al. []. No lymphvascular space involvement was seen and margins were tumor-free (at least 7 mm at the urethral margin as measured on the paraffin-embedded specimen).
The patient remained free of disease until twenty-one months later when she noticed a painful swelling of the left inguinal area (Figure ). A five centimeter tumor was noted. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not show any enlarged pelvic or paraaortic lymph nodes. Subsequently, bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy was performed. The left inguinal tumor was found to be a 4.3 cm metastasis of a well to moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma consistent with the previous diagnosis of vulvar carcinoma (Figure ). At that time, there was no evidence of vulvar recurrence and radiation therapy was given to the groin and to the pelvis. The patient remained free of disease for 69 months.

Abdominal pain was of recent onset and mainly in the left upper abdomen but she had fever for at least 6 months. Her pyrexia was high grade (39.5–40 C0), intermittent, and most common in the early morning. Clinical examination revealed a firm, vaguely defined, tender mass in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Blood results showed persistently high ESR (>100), high CRP (>240), leukocytosis, mildly raised Alkaline Phosphatase and anaemia (normochromic, normocytic). There was no overt source of infection that could account for the fever. Repeated blood cultures did not yield any bacterial growth. NM Leukocyte HMPAO scan showed no convincing abnormality to help localise an infective focus. There was no improvement in pyrexia after treating the patient with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
CT scan of the abdomen was performed which showed three heterogeneous masses in left upper abdomen relating to splenic flexure of colon, pancreatic body and tail and left crus of the diaphragm (figure ). There was evidence of central necrosis in two of these masses. A trucut biopsy of the mass was performed and histology revealed spindle cell leiomyosarcoma.
The patient was consented for surgery and distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, left adrenalectomy and resection of part of colon was undertaken to remove the tumour via a left thoracoabdominal approach. The patient had an uneventful post-operative recovery and her pyrexia resolved completely following surgery.
Three different specimens were submitted for histology. Specimen A had a smooth external surface, measured 180 × 140 × 130 mm and comprised of a multi-nodular mass with spleen and a loop of large bowel. The cut surface of the tumour was grey with large areas of necrosis up to 80%. The bowel segment appeared to be entrapped and focally infiltrated by the tumour up to the mucosa; however, both cut ends margins were free of tumour. Specimen B comprised of lobulated mass with fatty tissue and measured 140 × 60 × 30 mm. Some adrenal tissue was identified which was not involved by the tumour. Specimen C consisted of four pieces of haemorrhagic tissue.
Microscopically, specimen A showed a mixture of patterns; in some areas, spindle cells with hyalinisation and in other, pleomorphic cells mixed tumour and osteoclast giant cells. Focally, tumour cells had long thin cytoplasmic processes and wavy nuclei. In addition, there was a prominent inflammatory cell infiltrate in the background with foamy histiocytes. Also, the nuclear atypia was marked with a brisk mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry of the tumour showed smooth muscle actin (SMA) to be focally positive, but Desmin, CD34, S-100, Neurofilament, EMA, CAM 5.2, CD117, CD21 and CD23 were negative. All these appearances were suggestive of a high-grade sarcoma with no discernible line of differentiation; hence it was best classified as grade 3 malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Specimen B showed spindle cell sarcoma with cells showing elongated thin cytoplasmic processes and wavy nuclei. Specimen C showed spindle-pleomorphic sarcoma (Figure ).
Two months following resection of the tumour, the patient again developed high-grade fever. This was associated with left shoulder pain and weight loss. Investigations showed anaemia and hypercalcaemia. On CT scanning, she was found to have local recurrence of the tumour (figure ) as well as liver metastases (figure ).

422,1513593-1,16584570,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1513593.xml,Adult clear cell sarcoma of the kidney: A case report,"A 22-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of left flank pain. A color duplex sonography revealed a hypervascular, heterogeneous renal mass 125 × 156 × 195 mm. in diameter. Abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography showed a heterogeneous mass originating from the lower pole of the left kidney and infiltrating to the psoas muscle (fig. ). Further evaluation including bone scan did not demonstrate any evidence of metastases. A left radical nephrectomy with hilar lymphadenectomy through an intraperitoneal approach with an anterior subcostal incision was performed. The patient was discharged from hospital on postoperative day 5 without any complication.
Histopathological examination revealed that classic pattern of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney consisted of cells with fine nuclear chromatin, pale cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders forming nests separated by a fibrovascular stroma (fig. ). Stain for cytokeratin was negative while tumor cells were positive for vimentin. The histopathological diagnosis of the mass was a clear cell sarcoma of the kidney. No lymph node metastases were found. Final pathologic stage was T3aN0M0 and accepted as stage 2 according to updated National Wilms Tumor Study 5 definition. Concomitant chemo-radiotherapy was performed. The patient underwent adjuvant radiotherapy to the left nephrectomy bed (4950 cGy). As adjuvant chemotherapy, Actinomycin (1.2 mg/m2) with Vincristine (2 mg/m2) and Doxorubicin (30 mg/m2) with Vincristin (2 mg/m2) were administered subsequently for one day every 3 weeks during one-year period. Therapy-related serious side effects were not observed. There was no evidence of local recurrence or metastases during the following Twenty-four months after therapy.
CCSK is frequently confused with Wilms tumor in children. However, Argani and colleagues reported the striking differences between clear cell sarcoma and Wilms tumor []. The large size, areas of necrosis, a mucoid structure, and the cyst formation are the important gross features of this neoplasm. Stain for cytokeratin is negative while tumor cells are positive for vimentin in clear cell sarcoma of the kidney. It usually tends to metastasize to bones being different from Wilms tumor. It is declared that in pediatric patients the treatment with doxorubicin, the presence of necrosis, the stage of the disease, and the age of the patient at diagnosis were the significant prognostic factors for survival. These findings had been obtained from the records of the pediatric patients [].
CCSK is extremely rare neoplasm in adults. Amin and colleagues reviewed four new and eight previous cases of CCSK occurring in adult patients. They reported that clinic and pathologic features of CCSK did not differ significantly between adult and pediatric patients []. They also noted that CCSK was negative for most markers except for vimentin and this finding was helpful to distinguish it from undifferentiated adult renal neoplasm including sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma [].
Optimal treatment of adult patients with CCSK still remains unclear. Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are combined or used separately. Benchekroun et al reported a patient who underwent surgery followed by combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and doxorubicin and had no metastases 4 years later, but the metastases occurred within months in two patients who did not receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy after surgery []. In addition, Bhayani et al noted that a patient treated with surgery and combination chemotherapy (actinomycin, vincristine and doxorubicin) was disease-free at 12 months postoperatively []. In a report recently published by Rosso and colleagues, they treated a patient with surgery alone and stated that CCSK has a high resistance against radiation and chemotherapy [].
Advanced clear cell renal carcinoma is highly resistant to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs and especially interleukin-2 and interferon alpha, along with selected chemotherapeutic agents have proven to be the most effective, with response rates averaging about 20 percent []. However, Argani and colleagues declared that doxorubicin, regardless of disease stage, was an effective drug in CCSK and also pointed that the survival rate was 98% and 69% for the pediatric patients with stage 1 disease and for all stages, respectively []. Thus, its differentiation from clear cell renal carcinoma and undifferentiated adult renal neoplasm including sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma is especially important in adult patients. Our 22-year-old male patient received radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy with actinomycin, vincristine and doxorubicin after radical nephrectomy and lymph node dissection. Twenty-four months following surgery and concomitant chemoradiotherapy there was no evidence of local recurrence or metastases.","[[22.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['left flank', 'renal', 'Abdominal', 'pelvic', 'lower pole of the left kidney', 'psoas muscle', 'bone', 'left radical', 'hilar', 'intraperitoneal', 'anterior subcostal', 'kidney', 'kidney', 'lymph node', 'kidney', 'bones', 'renal', 'renal', 'renal', 'renal', 'renal', 'renal', 'radical', 'lymph node']","['left flank pain', 'hypervascular', 'heterogeneous renal mass', 'heterogeneous mass', 'metastases', 'complication', 'clear cell sarcoma of the kidney', 'cells with fine nuclear chromatin', 'pale cytoplasm', 'indistinct cell borders forming nests separated by a fibrovascular stroma', 'mass', 'clear cell sarcoma of the kidney', 'lymph node metastases', 'Therapy-related serious side effects', 'local recurrence', 'metastases', 'CCSK', 'Wilms tumor', 'clear cell sarcoma', 'Wilms tumor', 'necrosis', 'mucoid structure', 'cyst formation', 'neoplasm', 'tumor cells', 'clear cell sarcoma', 'clear cell sarcoma of the kidney', 'metastasize to bones', 'Wilms tumor', 'necrosis', 'CCSK', 'neoplasm', 'CCSK', 'CCSK', 'CCSK', 'renal neoplasm', 'sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma', 'CCSK', 'metastases', 'metastases', 'disease-free', 'CCSK', 'clear cell renal carcinoma', 'disease', 'disease', 'clear cell renal carcinoma', 'renal neoplasm', 'sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma', 'local recurrence', 'metastases']","['Actinomycin', 'Vincristine', 'Doxorubicin', 'Vincristin', 'vimentin', 'doxorubicin', 'vimentin', 'cisplatin', 'doxorubicin', 'actinomycin', 'vincristine', 'doxorubicin', 'doxorubicin', 'actinomycin', 'vincristine', 'doxorubicin']","['22', 'Amin', 'Rosso', 'Argani', '22']","['color duplex sonography', 'Abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography', 'bone scan', 'left radical nephrectomy', 'hilar lymphadenectomy', 'anterior subcostal incision', 'Histopathological examination', 'Stain for cytokeratin', 'tumor cells', 'histopathological', 'National Wilms Tumor Study', 'chemo-radiotherapy', 'adjuvant radiotherapy', 'adjuvant chemotherapy', 'therapy', 'Stain for cytokeratin', 'tumor cells', 'treatment', 'CCSK', 'markers', 'treatment', 'Surgery', 'radiotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'surgery', 'combination chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'radiotherapy', 'surgery', 'surgery', 'combination chemotherapy', 'surgery', 'radiation', 'chemotherapy', 'interleukin-2', 'interferon alpha', 'chemotherapeutic agents', 'CCSK', 'survival rate', 'radiotherapy', 'combination chemotherapy', 'radical nephrectomy', 'lymph node dissection', 'surgery', 'chemoradiotherapy']","['2-month', 'postoperative day 5', '4 years later', 'within months', '12 months', 'postoperatively', 'Twenty-four months']"

mass was nodular in contour, fixed, nonulcerated, with multiple
sinus tracts draining serosanguinous fluid ().
The cervix was small and mobile as was the uterus on pelvic exam.
There were palpable right inguinal nodes. Laboratory evaluation
was normal except for an elevated WBC, for which the patient was
placed on a broad spectrum antibiotic. A CT of the
chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed a normal chest and abdomen. The
pelvic CT revealed a 10 cm vulvar mass with solid and cystic
components without associated adenopathy ().
The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for
vulvar biopsy; a wedge shape tissue sample was taken from the mons
lesion, with a smaller tissue samples from the right labia majora
and inguinal region. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were also
obtained in the operating room. Pathology revealed a ruptured
epidermal inclusion cyst containing granulation tissue, acute and
chronic inflammation, and multinucleated giant cells. Cultures
were positive for Actinomyces israelii,
Propionibacterium acnes, and Peptostreptococcus.
Infectious disease was consulted postoperatively; recommendations
included an intravenous course of third generation cephalosporin for
6 weeks, followed by oral antibiotics until disease resolution is
observed. Three options were discussed with the patient: expectant
management, medical therapy, or surgical extirpation followed by
antibiotics. The patient opted for antibiotic treatment. A PICC
line was placed to facilitate extended IV antibiotic
administration of ceftriaxone (Rocephin; 2 gm IV for 12
weeks). Home health nursing was arranged, and the patient was
discharged home in stable condition.","[[60.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['vulvar', 'vaginal', 'breast', 'ovarian', 'colon', 'vulvar', 'right mons', 'right labia majora', 'sinus tracts', 'cervix', 'uterus', 'pelvic', 'right inguinal', 'pelvis', 'chest', 'abdomen', 'pelvic', 'vulvar', 'vulvar', 'mons', 'tissue', 'right labia majora', 'inguinal region', 'epidermal', 'tissue']","['gravida 1', 'para 1', 'vulvar mass', 'mass', 'malignancy', 'polyarthritis', 'hypertension', 'hernia', 'complication', 'unremarkable', 'normal pap smear', 'menopause', 'tobacco use', 'cancer', 'vulvar mass', 'mass', 'sinus tracts draining serosanguinous fluid', 'small', 'mobile', 'right inguinal nodes', 'elevated WBC', 'vulvar mass', 'solid and cystic\ncomponents', 'adenopathy', 'mons\nlesion', 'tissue samples', 'epidermal inclusion cyst', 'granulation tissue', 'inflammation', 'multinucleated giant cells', 'Actinomyces israelii', 'Propionibacterium acnes', 'Peptostreptococcus', 'Infectious disease', 'disease resolution', 'stable condition']","['cephalosporin', 'ceftriaxone', 'Rocephin']","['60', '1998', '53', 'operating room', 'operating room', 'Pathology']","['antihypertensives', 'hernia\nsurgically repaired', 'spontaneous\nvaginal delivery', 'pap smear', 'IUD', 'hormone', 'pelvic exam', 'Laboratory', 'WBC', 'broad spectrum antibiotic', 'CT of the\nchest/abdomen/pelvis', 'pelvic CT', 'vulvar biopsy', 'Aerobic and anaerobic cultures', 'Pathology', 'Cultures', 'antibiotics', 'medical therapy', 'surgical extirpation', 'antibiotics', 'antibiotic treatment', 'A PICC\nline was placed', 'antibiotic']","['recently', 'in 1998', 'last\nyear', 'last\nyear']"

A case report,"The patient is a 60-year old man who was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 1989 and had a family history of overweight and diabetes. Retinopathy was diagnosed in the mid-90s. The patient had been treated several times with focal laser photocoagulation. In 2003 he developed proliferative retinopathy and was treated with photocoagulation. In addition to glimepiride and the ACE-inhibitor quinapril, medication included metoprolol, furosemide, simvastatin and aspirin. In 1995–1997, his blood pressure (BP) was on average 125/90 mm Hg. Over the same period, the patient's bodyweight varied between 89 kg and 85 kg. Traditional dietary counselling for weight loss usually resulted in a short-term loss of a few kg, but the bodyweight soon increased again.
In July 1997 albuminuria was noted with a urine concentration of 116 mg/l. That year the patient's average body mass index (BMI) was 29.4 kg/m2 and the average bodyweight was 87.0 kg.
Insulin treatment was started four months later resulting in a temporary improvement of HbA1c but an increase in bodyweight. One year later, his BMI was 32.5 kg/m2 and his weight was 94 kg. The insulin dose was lowered in order to avoid further increase in bodyweight. In the years 1998–1999, following the weight increase and despite improved glycemic control, his BP increased to an average 145/90 mm Hg. Likewise, urine albumin increased as seen in the Figure. In 2000, despite a still reasonable glycemic control but following further weight increase, the albuminuria reached an average of more than 2000 mg/l and the BP was 160/90 mm Hg. Both were controlled by exchanging quinapril for the angiotensin II receptor antagonist candesartan, and by adding amlopidine. The BP has since been stable, averaging 130/76 (± 10/7) mm Hg, but the decline of renal function continued. The Figure shows the albuminuria record and the increase in HbA1c, serum creatinine and body weight with increasing insulin dosage.
In January 2004 his diet was changed radically by reducing dietary carbohydrates to 80–90 g per day, consisting only of vegetables and small amounts of hard bread (crisp bread). Potatoes, bread, pasta, rice and cereals were excluded, and the caloric requirements were covered by protein and fat. To ease the transition the patient was supplied with a number of meal recipes suggesting a caloric restriction to about 1800 calories per day. The per cent proportions of carbohydrates, fat and protein in the recipes were 20 : 50: 30.
Less than two weeks later the patient discontinued his insulin treatment and 6 months later his bodyweight had decreased by 19 kg. HbA1c had dropped to 6.5 % after 3 months, and the steady rise of his serum creatinine stopped. The creatinine has since – for two-and-a-half years – been stable as seen in the figure. When insulin was discontinued rosiglitazone was prescribed. In the Table measured parameters are shown before the dietary change, and now. As of late 2005 there was no sign of proliferative disease in the patient's retinopathy.","[[60.0, 'year']]",M,2006,['renal'],"['diabetes', 'overweight', 'diabetes', 'Retinopathy', 'proliferative retinopathy', 'weight loss', 'short-term loss of a few kg', 'bodyweight soon increased', 'albuminuria', 'increase in bodyweight', 'increase in bodyweight', 'weight increase', 'improved glycemic control', 'urine albumin increased', 'weight increase', 'albuminuria', 'decline of renal function', 'proliferative', 'proliferative disease', 'retinopathy']","['glimepiride', 'quinapril', 'metoprolol', 'furosemide', 'simvastatin', 'aspirin', 'insulin', 'quinapril', 'candesartan', 'amlopidine', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'rosiglitazone']","['60-year', '1989', '2003', 'July 1997', '2000', '10/7', 'January 2004', '2005']","['focal laser photocoagulation', 'photocoagulation', 'ACE-inhibitor', 'medication', 'blood pressure', 'BP', 'bodyweight', 'dietary counselling', 'bodyweight', 'urine concentration', 'average body mass index', 'BMI', 'average bodyweight', 'Insulin treatment', 'HbA1c', 'bodyweight', 'BMI', 'weight', 'bodyweight', 'BP', 'urine albumin', 'glycemic control', 'weight', 'albuminuria', 'BP', 'BP', 'albuminuria', 'HbA1c', 'serum creatinine', 'body weight', 'diet', 'dietary carbohydrates', 'caloric requirements', 'caloric restriction', 'insulin treatment', 'bodyweight', 'HbA1c', 'serum creatinine', 'creatinine', 'dietary change']","['1989', 'mid-90s', 'July 1997', 'One year later', 'One year later', 'In the years', 'January 2004', 'Less than two weeks later', '6 months later', 'two-and-a-half years']"

She had consulted her general practitioner on the morning of admission after developing left loin pain with associated dysuria, nausea and vomiting. This pain appeared to follow a bout of coughing. A provisional diagnosis of pyelonephritis was made and she was prescribed an oral antibiotic. Her pain worsened and she was admitted to hospital that same afternoon.
She was noted to be taking the combined oral contraceptive pill. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable.
Initial clinical examination revealed her to be comfortable lying flat. Her loin pain was exacerbated by movement. Her mucosal membranes were dry. Despite a blood pressure of 99/58 there were no other features of hypovolaemic shock. She was apyrexial.
Cardio-respiratory examination was unremarkable. She had tenderness in the left side of her abdomen with no associated features of peritonism. The remainder of her clinical examination was normal.
Her routine bloods tests were unremarkable. Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear antigen antibody serology was positive suggesting previous exposure to the virus. A plain KUB radiograph and dip-stick urinalysis were negative. A pregnancy test was also negative.
Overnight her condition deteriorated. Her abdominal pain increased and she became hypotensive. Repeat clinical examination revealed a pulse of 78 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 82/40. She was now peritonitic in the left side of her abdomen. Rectal examination revealed a boggy mass in the pouch of Douglas.
An urgent abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast was arranged. This demonstrated extensive free fluid throughout the abdomen and a large perisplenic haematoma. The spleen had several lacerations extending to the surface from focal hypodense cyst-like lesions of the splenic parenchyma (Fig ). These lesions contained foci of contrast enhancement and did not exert mass effect on the splenic vessels coursing through them (Fig ). In addition, a 1.5 cm lesion of low attenuation, demonstrating nodular peripheral enhancement on the portal venous phase, was noted in the dome of the right lobe of the liver (Fig ). The right ovary also contained a 3.5 cm area of low attenuation consistent with an ovarian cyst.
The patient was taken to the operating theatre where she underwent emergency splenectomy via a midline laparotomy. From within her peritoneal cavity, 1500 mls of free blood were evacuated. The spleen was found to be deeply lacerated with active bleeding. Post-operatively she was admitted to the Intensive Therapy Unit and returned to the ward after twenty-four hours. She went on to make a rapid and uneventful recovery and was discharged home on day six.
Gross examination showed a 250 g spleen with multiple subcapsular haemorrhagic nodules, one of which was associated with an area of capsular rupture. Sectioning revealed dilated vascular spaces measuring up to 10 mm in diameter present throughout the splenic parenchyma. Histological examination showed unlined, blood-filled spaces (Figs and ). There was red pulp congestion with scattered Warthin-Finkeldey polykaryocytes (Fig ). In lymph nodes, these are associated with viral infection, in particular (but not specifically) measles. These features were consistent with splenic peliosis.
Her oral contraceptive medication was discontinued. A follow-up liver MRI scan was planned for further evaluation of the liver lesion to differentiate between a haemangioma and a solitary focus of hepatic peliosis. The MRI confirmed the lesion to be a haemangioma.","[[26.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['left loin', 'loin', 'mucosal membranes', 'Cardio-respiratory', 'left side of her abdomen', 'KUB', 'abdominal', 'left side of her abdomen', 'Rectal', 'pouch of Douglas', 'abdominal', 'abdomen', 'perisplenic', 'spleen', 'splenic parenchyma', 'splenic vessels', 'portal venous phase', 'dome of the right lobe of the liver', 'right ovary', 'ovarian', 'peritoneal cavity', 'spleen', 'spleen', 'subcapsular', 'area of capsular', 'vascular spaces', 'splenic parenchyma', 'pulp', 'lymph nodes', 'splenic', 'liver', 'hepatic']","['influenza-like symptoms', 'left loin pain', 'dysuria', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'pain', 'bout of coughing', 'coughing', 'pyelonephritis', 'pain', 'unremarkable', 'comfortable lying flat', 'loin pain', 'mucosal membranes were dry', 'hypovolaemic shock', 'apyrexial', 'unremarkable', 'tenderness', 'peritonism', 'exposure to the virus', 'condition deteriorated', 'abdominal pain', 'hypotensive', 'peritonitic', 'mass', 'free fluid', 'perisplenic haematoma', 'lacerations', 'lesions of the splenic parenchyma', 'lesions', 'foci of contrast enhancement', 'mass', 'mass effect', 'lesion', 'nodular peripheral enhancement', 'low attenuation', 'ovarian cyst', 'free blood', 'lacerated', 'bleeding', 'rapid and uneventful recovery', 'subcapsular haemorrhagic nodules', 'area of capsular rupture', 'dilated vascular spaces', 'unlined', 'blood-filled spaces', 'red pulp congestion', 'Warthin-Finkeldey polykaryocytes', 'viral infection', 'measles', 'splenic peliosis', 'liver lesion', 'haemangioma', 'solitary focus of hepatic peliosis', 'lesion', 'haemangioma']",[],"['operating theatre', 'Intensive Therapy Unit', 'ward']","['antibiotic', 'contraceptive pill', 'clinical examination', 'blood pressure', 'clinical examination', 'bloods tests', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear antigen antibody serology', 'plain KUB radiograph', 'dip-stick urinalysis', 'pregnancy test', 'pulse', 'blood pressure', 'Rectal examination', 'abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast', 'emergency splenectomy via a midline laparotomy', '1500 mls of free blood were evacuated', 'Gross examination', 'Sectioning', 'Histological examination', 'contraceptive medication', 'liver MRI scan', 'MRI scan', 'MRI']","['five day', 'on the morning of admission', 'Overnight']"

She tripped and fell at home three days prior to admission, landing on her left side. On admission she complained of left sided abdominal and chest pain. She was known to have atrial fibrillation, congestive cardiac failure and rheumatoid arthritis. In the past, she had received a short course of corticosteroids for her rheumatoid disease. She denied any history of immunosuppressive therapy.
Examination revealed a localised area of peritonism in her left upper quadrant. She was haemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 124/74 and a pulse of 76. Her haematological profile revealed a total white cell count of 11.9 (4 – 11 × 109/l), haemoglobin of 10.1 (11.5 – 15.5 g/dl) with a normal mean corpuscular volume. Biochemical analysis revealed a creatinine of 111 μmol/l (54 – 84) but was otherwise unremarkable. Her INR was 1.2. Liver function was within normal limits.
An urgent abdominal CT scan was requested. This demonstrated a complex laceration through the anterosuperior portion of the spleen extending to its lateral margin with perisplenic haematoma free intraperitoneal blood (Fig ). More inferiorly the splenic parenchyma demonstrated foci of contrast enhancement adjacent to a hypodense cyst-like lesion and further lacerations, with disruption of the splenic capsule anteriorly (Fig )
She was initially managed conservatively on the ward but became haemodynamically unstable. In addition her haemoglobin was found to have dropped from 10.1 to 6.8. She subsequently underwent emergency splenectomy via midline laparotomy without complication. She went on to make a full recovery.
Macroscopic examination showed a spleen measuring 110 × 85 × 40 mm weighing 215 g. Subcapsular haemorrhagic nodules were noted, one of which was associated with an 80 mm capsular tear (Fig ).

A CT scan showed thickened right parietal pleura with a minimal pleural effusion, but no pulmonary nodules or lymphadenopathies or distant metastases. Because of negative cytology malignancy, the patient underwent a thoracoscopic pleural biopsy on December 2004 that showed an epithelioid monophasic pleural mesothelioma, followed by talc pleurodesis at the end of the procedure.
Three weeks later the patient underwent a right extrapleural pneumonectomy with coverage of the bronchial stump with a flap of thymic tissue. The pathological examination confirmed a monophasic epithelioid pleural mesothelioma, with lung and pericardial fat infiltration, but no invasion of the diaphragm or pericardium (pT3 N0 M0). The postoperative period was uneventful.
Ten months later the patient complained of a fever and cough. The diagnosis of broncho-pleural fistula was made immediately after the first appearance of cough and fever by bronchoscopy that clearly showed a 2-mm fistula on the mediastinal side of the stump confirmed by the methilene blue passage from bronchus to the chest tube. Rapid fluid drainage and antibiotic therapy allowed us to cure the infection of the pleural space avoiding the formation of empyema. After chest tube drainage, the attempt to conservatively close the fistula using biological glue was unsuccessful. So we decided to use a modified Y Dumon stent (Tracheobronxane Y; Novatech SA, La Ciotat Cedex France) to exclude the right stump. The right arm of the Y was shortened and the open end was closed with a silicone material from which the stent was fabricated, and then inserted in the tracheobronchial tree trough a rigid bronchoscope. The tracheal part was 18 mm in width and 4 cm in length, while the left bronchial arm was 16 mm in width and 2 cm in length. Under rigid bronchoscopy, we first introduced the biological glue (CoSeal, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Fremont, CA – USA) all over the bronchial stump that was of 1 cm lenght, followed by the insertion of the modified Y Dumon stent (Fig. –).
The negative cultures from the pleural fluid allowed us to remove the chest drain and to discharge the patient on the 3rd postoperative day. The patient was uneventful (no empyema or pneumonitis verified) until he died 4 months later for pulmonary emboli. The post-mortem examination showed a massive pulmonary thrombus in the left main pulmonary artery which explain the sudden respiratory insufficiency and death at home and an initial relapse of mesothelioma in the posterior part of chest wall, without signs of infections.","[[64.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['pleural', 'right parietal pleura', 'pleural', 'pulmonary', 'pleural', 'pleural', 'right extrapleural', 'bronchial stump', 'flap of thymic tissue', 'thymic tissue', 'pleural', 'lung', 'pericardial', 'diaphragm', 'pericardium', 'pleural', 'mediastinal side of the stump', 'bronchus', 'bronchus to the chest tube', 'chest', 'pleural space', 'chest', 'right stump', 'right arm of the Y', 'tracheobronchial tree', 'tracheal part', 'left bronchial arm', 'pleural', 'chest', 'pulmonary', 'pulmonary', 'left main pulmonary artery', 'respiratory', 'posterior part of chest wall']","['pleural effusion', 'thickened right parietal pleura', 'pleural effusion', 'pulmonary nodules', 'lymphadenopathies', 'distant metastases', 'epithelioid monophasic pleural mesothelioma', 'flap of thymic tissue', 'monophasic epithelioid pleural mesothelioma', 'fat infiltration', 'invasion', 'postoperative period was uneventful', 'fever', 'cough', 'broncho-pleural fistula', 'cough', 'fever', 'fistula', 'methilene blue passage from bronchus to the chest tube', 'infection of the pleural space', 'empyema', 'fistula', 'pleural fluid', 'uneventful', 'empyema', 'pneumonitis', 'died', 'pulmonary emboli', 'pulmonary thrombus', 'respiratory insufficiency', 'death', 'mesothelioma', 'infections']",[],"['64-year', 'December 2004']","['CT scan', 'cytology malignancy', 'thoracoscopic pleural biopsy', 'talc pleurodesis', 'right extrapleural pneumonectomy', 'coverage of the bronchial stump with a flap of thymic tissue', 'pathological examination', 'bronchoscopy', 'Rapid fluid drainage', 'antibiotic therapy', 'chest tube drainage', 'conservatively close the fistula using biological glue', 'modified Y Dumon stent (Tracheobronxane Y; Novatech SA, La Ciotat Cedex France) to exclude the right stump', 'right arm of the Y was shortened and the open end was closed with a silicone material', 'open end was closed with a silicone material from which the stent was fabricated, and then inserted in the tracheobronchial tree trough a rigid bronchoscope', 'left bronchial arm', 'length', 'rigid bronchoscopy', 'insertion of the modified Y Dumon stent', 'cultures', 'remove the chest drain', 'post-mortem examination']","['December 2004', 'Ten months later', 'Ten months later', '4 months later']"

James Cancer Hospital with worsening pain of the left breast and left chest wall region and a recurrent palpable mass within the inferior aspect of her left breast. She reports having had three separate left breast biopsies in the past (seven years, four years, and one year prior to her current presentation) for a recurring left breast palpable mass in this same location.
Seven years prior to her current presentation, she presented to an outside community hospital with a palpable left breast mass in the inferior lateral aspect of her left breast. She underwent a left breast biopsy at that time that was reported as showing dense fibrous stroma with fibrocystic changes.
Three years later (four years prior to her current presentation), she noticed a recurrent enlarging palpable left breast mass. She underwent a repeat left breast biopsy by the same surgeon and this showed hyperplastic fibrosis, consistent with fibromatosis of the breast. The pathology report clearly stated that the tumor involved the surgical margins. The patient reports that the surgeon told her that this was a benign tumor and that nothing further needed to be done.
Three additional years later (one year prior to her current presentation), she again noticed a recurrent enlarging palpable left breast mass. She again underwent a repeat left breast biopsy by the same surgeon and this again showed findings consistent with fibromatosis of the breast. Again, the pathology report clearly stated that the tumor involved the surgical margins. The patient reports that the surgeon again told her that this was a benign tumor and that nothing further needed to be done.
Since the time of her last left breast biopsy (one year prior to her current presentation), the patient reports persistent and worsening pain and palpable tenderness within the inferior aspect of her left breast and left chest wall region, with an associated increasing sized palpable mass within the same region.
Upon presentation to The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital, she was found on clinical examination to have volume loss along the entire inferior aspect of her left breast and slight downward tilting of her left nipple and areolar complex. She had three separate well-healed surgical scars along the inferior-lateral aspect of her left inframammary fold (Figure ). Underneath these scars, she had a firm palpable mass, clinically measuring 6.5 × 3.0 × 2.5 cm in size and which clinically appeared to be adherent to the underlying left chest wall structures. She had no clinically apparent adenopathy in her left axilla.
A mammogram showed scarring and tissue disorganization in the inferior left breast from prior multiple biopsies, but appeared unchanged since a prior mammogram done 13 months previously at an outside community hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left breast showed an intensely enhancing lesion in the inferior-lateral aspect of the left breast, measuring 5.0 × 1.7 cm in size (Figure and ). This lesion appeared to abut the underlying chest wall musculature and appeared to efface the underlying fat plane. Computed tomography scan of the chest showed a 5.2 × 1.6 cm mass within the inferior-lateral aspect of the left chest wall that appeared to be in continuity with the left pectoralis major muscle and left serratus anterior muscle (Figure ). A core biopsy was performed to the palpable left breast mass that confirmed the diagnosis of fibromatosis.
The patient was taken to the operating room at to The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and underwent a left total mastectomy, with en bloc resection of the underlying musculature (inferior lateral portion of the left pectoralis major muscle, superior portion of the left abdominal oblique musculature, and anterior portion of the left serratus anterior muscle) and en bloc resection of the underlying chest wall structures (fourth, fifth, and six ribs, intercostals muscles, and parietal pleura). The left chest wall defect (Figure ) was then closed with a 2-mm DualMesh Gore-Tex patch (W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, Arizona). The remaining portions of the left pectoralis major muscle was dissected off the underlying left chest wall and its lateral most attachments to the left humerus and superior attachments to the clavicle were divided, allowing it to rotate inferiorly to completely cover the Gore-Tex patch. The left mastectomy site was then closed in the standard fashion. No attempts at cosmetic breast reconstruction with autologous tissue transfer or expander/implant placement were considered at that time. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful and she was discharged to home on post-operative day eight.
Gross pathologic evaluation of the specimen, which overall measured 14.5 × 13.3 × 6.4 cm in size, revealed a 5.2 cm tumor that was grossly invading the underlying attached skeletal muscle to a depth of about 1.2 cm (Figure ). It could not be definitively determined whether the invasion of the underlying skeletal muscle involved only the superficial muscles resected (consisting of the inferior lateral portion of the left pectoralis major muscle, superior portion of the left abdominal oblique musculature, and anterior portion of the left serratus anterior muscle) or whether skeletal muscle invasion was to the level of the underlying intercostal muscles resected. However, both grossly and microscopically, there was no evidence of invasion into the bony ribs or underlying parietal pleura. Microscopic evaluation revealed a proliferation of relatively evenly spaced plump spindle cells arranged in intersecting fascicles and associated with mild to moderate amounts of collagen and occasional mitotic figures (Figure ) and demonstrated that the spindle cell proliferations invaded into the adjacent skeletal muscle (Figure ). All surgical margins were negative. On immunohistochemical staining, the spindle cells were negative for S-100 protein, muscle actin (HHF-35), and cytokeratin AE1/AE3. On immunohistochemical staining, less than 5% of the spindle cells were positive for Mib1 (Ki-67). The histology and immunohistochemical staining supported a diagnosis of fibromatosis (desmoid tumor).

Abdominal examination revealed a large, irregular, firm supra-pubic mass. On pelvic examination, the same mass was felt in the vagina. Cervix and uterus were not felt separately from the mass. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large, well defined heterogeneous abdomino-pelvic mass. Serum CA-125 level was 52.3 U/mL. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, which revealed a large, bosselated mass arising from the cervix. Body of the uterus, bilateral ovaries, tubes and other abdomino-pelvic organs were within normal limits. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with complete excision of the mass was done after identifying the ureters from pelvic brim to their entry into the urinary bladder. Her postoperative recovery was uneventful.
The patient was kept under close observation after initial treatment. Four months after surgery, on routine follow-up, vaginal cytology showed the malignant squamous component of MMMT. The recurrence was confirmed by colposcopy-guided biopsy from the vaginal vault. Physical examination and CT-scan did not reveal any evidence of disease elsewhere. This recurrence was treated with radical pelvic radiotherapy (RT) (external pelvic RT 60 Gy in 30 fractions plus 2 intracavitary applications of 6 Gy each). The patient is free of disease at eighteen months after the treatment of recurrence.
Gross examination of the surgical specimen revealed a 28 × 20 × 15 cm bosselated, mass arising from the cervix. The cervical canal was distorted because of the mass. On cut surface, the mass was fleshy, solid with cystic areas.
On hematomylin and eosin staining, the entire tumor showed cellular whorls dispersed amidst pale sarcomatous stroma. The cells in whorls were round to short spindle shaped and had moderate mitotic activity (figure ). Although no vessels were seen in the center of these whorls, the whorled appearance was reminiscent of an endometrial stromal sarcoma. Hence, the preliminary diagnosis of endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) was made. Additional sections however revealed that whorled areas had basaloid squamous carcinoma in the center (figure inset). A panel of immunohistochemical tests was performed and whorled basaloid areas were positive for cytokeratin (figure ), epithelial membrane antigen and CD 10 but were negative for vimentin confirming their epithelial nature. The stromal component of the tumor was highlighted on vimentin stain (figure ). The stromal element was sarcomatous and showed diffuse vimentin and focal SMA positivity. SMA, S-100, calponin, inhibin, Mic-2, desmin and myoglobin were negative in the basaloid islands. No heterologous elements were seen. The final diagnosis was homologous malignant mixed mullerian tumor with basaloid squamous carcinoma.","[[60.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['lower abdomen', 'Abdominal', 'supra-pubic', 'pelvic', 'vagina', 'Cervix', 'uterus', 'abdomino-pelvic', 'cervix', 'Body of the uterus', 'bilateral ovaries', 'tubes', 'abdomino-pelvic organs', 'abdominal', 'ureters', 'pelvic brim', 'urinary bladder', 'vaginal', 'vaginal vault', 'pelvic', 'external pelvic', 'intracavitary', 'cervix', 'cervical canal', 'cellular whorls', 'cells in whorls', 'vessels', 'center of these whorls', 'endometrial stromal', 'endometrial stromal', 'whorled areas', 'basaloid squamous', 'whorled basaloid areas', 'stromal component', 'stromal element']","['postmenopausal', 'lump', 'supra-pubic mass', 'mass', 'mass', 'heterogeneous abdomino-pelvic mass', 'bosselated mass', 'within normal limits', 'mass', 'recovery was uneventful', 'malignant squamous component of MMMT', 'disease', 'disease', 'bosselated', 'mass', 'distorted', 'mass', 'mass', 'tumor', 'cellular whorls dispersed', 'sarcomatous stroma', 'round to short spindle shaped', 'mitotic activity', 'vessels were seen in the center of these whorls', 'whorled appearance', 'endometrial stromal sarcoma', 'endometrial stromal sarcoma', 'ESS', 'basaloid squamous carcinoma', 'epithelial nature', 'stromal component of the tumor', 'stromal element was sarcomatous', 'vimentin', 'focal SMA positivity', 'SMA positivity', 'SMA', 'S-100', 'calponin', 'inhibin', 'Mic-2', 'heterologous elements', 'homologous malignant mixed mullerian tumor', 'basaloid squamous carcinoma']",[],['60'],"['Abdominal examination', 'pelvic examination', 'Computed tomography (CT)', 'Computed tomography (CT) scan', 'Serum CA-125 level', 'Exploratory laparotomy', 'Total abdominal hysterectomy', 'bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy', 'complete excision of the mass', 'treatment', 'vaginal cytology', 'colposcopy-guided biopsy from the vaginal vault', 'Physical examination', 'CT-scan', 'radical pelvic radiotherapy (RT)', 'external pelvic RT', 'intracavitary applications', 'treatment', 'Gross examination', 'hematomylin and eosin staining', 'panel of immunohistochemical tests', 'cytokeratin', 'epithelial membrane antigen', 'CD 10', 'vimentin', 'vimentin stain', 'SMA', 'S-100', 'calponin', 'inhibin', 'Mic-2', 'desmin', 'myoglobin']","['2 months', 'postoperative', 'eighteen months']"

431,1526441-1,16820063,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1526441.xml,Use of conventional and alternative treatment strategies for a case of low back pain in a F/A-18 aviator,"A 36-year-old male USMC F/A-18 aviator instructor with 15 years of flying experience had a severe episode of acute LBP without radiation or neurological deficit. The patient did not recall any specific traumatic incident that initiated the pain, but he did have a history of multiple LBP events, some of which included radiation into the legs. When the LBP began he immediately consulted the squadron flight surgeon and was prescribed naprosyn, diazepam and hydrocodone/acetaminofen for pain control, confined to quarters to rest and imaging was obtained. The pain worsened, resulting in hospitalization later that day. He was observed for 24 hours and given a methylprednisone dosepack. Upon discharge from the hospital, he was confined to quarters for 72 hours and not allowed to return to flying until cleared by the flight surgeon. The flight surgeon cleared the patient to fly and ordered consults to neurosurgery and physical therapy for further evaluation and treatment.
Plain film radiographs showed mild narrowing of the L4–L5 intervertebral disc space and mild sclerotic changes of the posterior elements of L5. MRI demonstrated a loss of normal height and signal involving the L4–L5 disc and a broad-based left paracentral disc bulge contacting the thecal sac and causing mild narrowing of the central spinal canal at the L4–L5 level with mild to moderate left neural foraminal narrowing and L5 nerve root contact (Fig ). A lesser degree of L5-S1 disc degeneration was present with a broad-based disc bulge causing no central canal or neural foraminal narrowing.
The flight surgeon coordinated the ordering and follow up of the patient's various clinical consults. The flight surgeon instructed the patient to take the anti-inflammatory medication as needed and gradually returned him to non-impact exercise, including walking and working out on an elliptical machine to pain tolerance.
Following neurosurgical evaluation the patient was provided concurrent consultations with the hospital physiatrist and physical therapist. The physiatrist provided osteopathic manipulation and home exercises, including prolonged prone lumbar extension and hip adductor stretching, which provided some pain diminishment. Acupuncture was attempted once, wherein he reported an increased sensation of lumbar muscle spasm. Acupuncture was discontinued.
The physical therapy regimen was begun 2 weeks after hospitalization and included McKenzie exercises (standing and prone repetitive standing lumbar extension), stretching (hamstrings, single knee-to-chest, quadriceps, gluteals, hip flexors) and an educational self-treatment booklet. The patient experienced some relief with the McKenzie exercises, hamstring stretching and self mobilization/stretching of the gluteal muscles and spine by drawing his leg over to the opposite side of his trunk. His pain and range of motion improved approximately 50%. A course of moist heat packs and mechanical lumbar traction (15 min, supine position with hips and knees flexed 90 degrees, intermittent pull for 15 s, starting at 10 lbs greater than 50% body weight and increasing 10 lbs each treatment) was attempted to further his progress. He continued doing the prescribed exercises and noted some improvement but pain elimination was refractory. At this time, the physical therapist discussed the case with the chiropractor, who is located in the same clinic at the air station, and subsequently ordered a consultation for chiropractic.
During the chiropractic consultation, the patient's pain was located in the lumbar region bilaterally, described as ""intense spasm"", and without any radiation or symptoms of neurological involvement. His pain was consistently worse in the morning; he reported that it would take up to 10 minutes for him to get out of bed due to stiffness and pain. He was concerned because this episode of LBP was of longer duration (4 months) than any prior episodes. He had discontinued his regular Marine Corps fitness training (running, sit-ups, pull-ups) because of pain exacerbation. He experienced increased pain after basic fighter maneuver flights, reporting that it would take as long as 15 minutes to get out of the jet and climb to the ground after flying. He stated that even though he was on flying status he would sometimes ask to be removed from the flight schedule because his back hurt too much to fly; on these days he would stay at work and perform other tasks. He rated the severity of pain at 1.5 cm on a 10 cm visual analog scale [], 7.1 cm upon waking and (in retrospect) 9.5 cm on the visual analog scale as the pain experienced during hospitalization. His modified Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire [] score was 5 out of 24 functional disability indicators. Lumbar spine active ranges of motion were full with pain at the end range of flexion and extension and when returning to a neutral posture from these end ranges. Hamstring length was approximately 60 degrees bilaterally and the gluteus medius had approximately 50% of its normal passive length. Trigger points were palpated in the right gluteus medius and bilateral lumbar paravertebral and quadratus lumborum muscles. There were no indicators of lumbosacral nerve root or cord compression (ie, negative Valsalva, Kemp's test, straight leg raise). Lower extremity sensation, motor and deep tendon reflex testing were normal. Given his age, nature of the clinical findings, and the imaging results, it was assumed that he was experiencing phase II spinal degeneration (clinical instability) as described by Kirkaldy-Willis [].
The chiropractor and flight surgeon discussed the case to insure that the flight surgeon was informed of the course of care. The chiropractor and the physical therapist discussed the case to insure that the care that the patient was receiving was complimentary and that any duplicate home exercises were planned redundancy. Thus, at this point in time, the patient was receiving care from the flight surgeon, physical therapist, and chiropractor and had 1 follow up visit scheduled with the physiatrist.
The 3 goals of chiropractic care were: 1) pain control; 2) ability to continue flight duties and USMC fitness training; 3) maintenance of aerobic fitness. Table summarizes the chiropractic treatment interventions and outcome measures at periodic reassessments. Details regarding treatment are presented below. Directions of force for chiropractic manipulation were selected by identifying areas of tenderness, asymmetry, restricted planes of active and passive range of motion, motion palpation, tight musculature and other indicators as described by Bergman and colleagues []. Chiropractic manipulation of the thoracolumbar junction, L5-S1 level and the sacroiliac joint typically involved a side-posture high-velocity, low-amplitude short lever maneuver []. Grade IV mobilization [] was used on several occasions when joint endfeel was not extremely stiff or if the patient was unable to tolerate a high velocity force. Active myofascial release treatment and ischemic compression as described by Barnes and Leahy were used to treat tight muscles and trigger points [,]. These muscles and surrounding joints were also stretched using the proprioceptive neurological facilitation maneuvers of post-contraction stretch and post-isometric relaxation []. The patient was instructed to self-administer trigger point ischemic compression to the gluteus medius by lying in the lateral recumbent position on top of a tennis ball and to stretch the muscle immediately afterward. He was instructed to continue the helpful stretches provided by the physiatrist and physical therapist, to stretch his low back before flying and to see his flight surgeon if his pain worsened.
By the 5th chiropractic treatment the patient reported there were no episodes of sharp ""muscle spasm"" pain in the previous week but periodic stiffness was experienced upon waking in the morning or after long periods of time in the jet. He was on regular flying status and he had discontinued taking any medication. The patient reported that the physiatrist had provided him with a home TENS unit for pain control, which provided relief at the end of long days in the jet or after prolonged sitting. At this point in time he was released from care by both the physiatrist and physical therapist and instructed to continue his home exercises and to return for care if symptoms worsened. Functional spinal stability was assessed by the chiropractor at the fifth office visit and the patient exhibited difficulty stabilizing his spine when asked to perform simple non-weight bearing movements called dead bug exercises []. He had no pain while performing a static crunch core endurance exercise. Treatment was modified to include core stabilizing exercises (Table ).
Subsequent chiropractic office visits focused on furthering the patient's torso function and insuring coordinated care between the flight surgeon and the chiropractor. These office visits were supplemented with some form of manipulation/mobilization as deemed necessary. Therapeutic exercises were made more difficult and targeted strength, endurance and proprioception of the lumbar extensors, oblique abdominal muscles and other torso stabilizers []. Tight psoas muscles were also addressed with home-based stretching (Table ). Summarily, the patient had 15 chiropractic office visits where he received care over a 26 week period. Office visits progressed from passive pain control techniques to active functional rehabilitation procedures and included the following treatments (frequency): high-velocity, low-amplitude manipulation (10); grade IV mobilization (8); proprioceptive neurological facilitation (6); myofascial release/ischemic compression (14); therapeutic exercise (7); moist heat pack application (2).
At a follow-up visit 1 month after his last treatment he was pain free and had full function. He was flying multiple training missions per week including high G flights and sorties of several hours in duration and had passed his required physical fitness test (100 sit-ups in 2 minutes, 3 mile run in less than 29 minutes and a minimum of 3 pull-ups) the week prior with no pain. He felt that the only provocative factor for minimal LBP at that time was flying the jet. The physical examination was normal; he was released from care and encouraged to maintain his core stabilization and overall fitness program.","[[36.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['neurological', 'legs',

Anamnesis revealed that the patient has been working as a secretary in an open-plan office for 22 years with spending the major working hours sitting at a monitor workstation. The woman reported about severe neck pain, especially increasing over the last few months. Finally her daily work was limited due to pain to a maximum of three hours daily. No traumatic insult of the cervical spine was recalled, as well as the patient performed no sportive activity especially stressing the cervical spine.
The physical examination revealed a discrete muscle rigidification in the area of the lateral cervical musculature. The range of motion in the cervical spine was significantly reduced concerning extension/flexion with 15°-0°-10°, right lateral/left lateral flexion with 20°-0°-20° as well as right/left rotation with 10°-0°-10°. However, neurological examination showed overall inconspicuous findings. Pain during the last week, assessed by the 100 mm visual analogue scale (range from 0 to 100, 0 means no pain or disability and 100 means maximal pain or disability) accounted for a mean of 70 ± 15 mm.
Conventional a-p and lateral cervical spine radiographs did not reveal major pathological findings within the spine, but a complete bilateral ossification of the stylohyoid ligaments (Figure and ).
MRI as well as laboratory checks on inflammatory/rheumatoid processes revealed each normal finding.
In summary, no typical morphological correlatives for the patient's reproducible pain-symptoms and the limitation of movement of the cervical spine were found, except the bilateral ossification of the stylohyoid ligaments.
As the orthopaedic therapies, consisting of physical therapies as well as several courses of carbamazepine, baclofen, antidepressants and NSAID were ineffective the patient was finally presented to oral maxillofacial surgery for open resection of both ossified ligaments.
After the patient's dismissal from the hospital and an initial rehabilitation period, the patient now half a year later is free of pain. Movements of the head and neck improved significantly with a range of motion in extension/flexion of 45°-0°-40°, right lateral/left lateral flexion of 35°-0°-35° as well as right/left rotation of 20°-0°-20°. Pain during the last week, again assessed by the 100 mm VAS accounted for a mean of15 ± 5 mm.

Case report and review of literature,"A 63-year-old male patient in reasonably good health suddenly suffered from fever (>38°C) and a painful right iliac fossa tumefaction; no other gastrointestinal problems were noted. On clinical examination, a mass of about 5 cm was palpable in correspondence of right iliac fossa and appeared hard, not reducible and fixed to the parietal muscle.
Laboratory data showed mild anaemia (haemoglobin: 10.7 g/dl, hematocrit: 31%) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (74 mm/hr) as pathological findings. Alvarado score was 6 and therefore a parenteral antimicrobial therapy was administered.
Abdominal ultrasound examination evidenced an abscess in the right lower quadrant, with heterogenic echotexture and a thickening of the ileocecal tract. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT), confirmed the presence of a complex, predominantly cystic, mass of large size (6 × 8 cm) with heterogeneous, mainly peripheral enhancement (figure ). The adjacent cecum had its wall thickened and it was not possible to differentiate the appendix separately from the mass. Homolateral inguinal reactive lymphadenopathy was also present. The patient failed to respond to the initial conservative management, which consisted of intravenous fluids and triple antibiotic therapy with cefotaxime, gentamicin and metronidazole, without any improvement of pain and fever. At a further ultrasound examination, the mass appeared not modified.

Under general anesthetic, the anesthetist used a Site-Rite 3 (Bard Access systems, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) ultrasound unit while attempting to access the right internal jugular vein for venous sheath placement. This attempt failed.
The anesthetist then used the same ultrasound unit attempting to access the right subclavian vein for venous sheath placement. Following what was presumed to be successful ultrasound guided venous access, an 8.5 F sheath was implanted. The anesthetist noted an arterial wave-form arising from the sheath tracing. It was presumed that the subclavian artery, beneath the mid-portion of the clavicle, had been inadvertently catheterized. The sheath was left in situ due to concerns about uncontrollable arterial bleeding if it was extracted without the ability to directly compress the arterial puncture site.
The cardiovascular surgeon performed aortic valve replacement and aorto-coronary bypass surgery. Consultation with a peripheral vascular surgeon was sought. The peripheral vascular surgeon suggested that rather than perform a complicated surgical procedure to extract the sheath, i.e. an extensive anterior chest wall dissection and resection, that interventional radiology be consulted about angiography and the possible placement of a stent-graft in the infraclavicular subclavian artery. The cardiovascular surgeon consulted the interventional radiology team.
The patient was transferred to the angiography suite directly from the operating room and remained under general anesthetic. Consent for the procedure was obtained from the patient's family.
Right femoral artery access was achieved and a 6 F groin sheath was placed for angiographic imaging. Injections of the right innominate artery demonstrated a normal infra-clavicular subclavian artery. The 8.5 F sheath was situated with the tip just downstream from the origin of the right common carotid artery within the proximal right subclavian artery. (figure ) Further angiographic images were obtained in other projections. In addition, the 8.5 F sheath was directly injected with contrast agent in order to determine the exact location of the sheath. Early (figure ) and delayed (figure ) angiographic images were acquired.
It was determined that the 8.5 F sheath had actually entered via the ventral aspect of the right subclavian artery just downstream of the origin of the right common carotid artery and had not punctured the more distal infra-clavicular subclavian artery as suspected by the clinical team. There was no evidence of spasm or extravasation of contrast at the site of the catheter entrance into the subclavian artery, or elsewhere. Despite the very proximal entry point of this catheter into the subclavian artery the cardiovascular surgeon had not been able to directly visualize it, or palpate it, during the surgical exploration of the mediastinum.
Right sided pelvic angiography was performed to ensure that the pelvic arterial anatomy would accommodate the placement of a stent-graft. There were no pelvic or distal aortic impediments to stent-graft placement.
The 6 F right femoral artery sheath was removed and a 12 F right common femoral artery sheath was implanted to accommodate the stent-graft. An exchange length Amplatz guide wire was situated with the tip in the right axillary artery. A 70 mm long/12 mm diameter Wallgraft endoprosthesis (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) was successfully implanted in the right subclavian artery while the 8.5 F sheath in the subclavian artery was simultaneously extracted.
Immediate post-implantation angiography demonstrated a patent stent-graft and acute occlusion of the right internal mammary artery and the right vertebral artery. There was no evidence of contrast extravasation and no clinical evidence of subclavian artery bleeding. (figure ) The patient remained hemodynamically stable. The right groin sheath was extracted and groin hemostasis was achieved. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further care. Right arm and right leg pulses were all palpable and there was no clinical evidence of hemorrhage.
The patient spent 3 days in the ICU and was then discharged to the ward. She recovered with no evidence of peripheral vascular or neurologic sequelae. She was discharged from hospital to further convalesce 3 days after leaving the ICU.","[[77.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['aortic valve', 'aorto-coronary', 'right internal jugular vein', 'venous', 'right subclavian vein', 'venous', 'venous', 'arterial', 'subclavian artery', 'beneath the mid-portion of the clavicle', 'arterial', 'arterial puncture site', 'aortic valve', 'aorto-coronary', 'anterior chest wall', 'infraclavicular subclavian artery', 'Right femoral artery', 'groin', 'infra-clavicular subclavian artery', 'tip just downstream from the origin of the right common carotid artery within the proximal right subclavian artery', 'downstream from the origin of the right common carotid', 'ventral aspect of the right subclavian artery just downstream of the origin of the right common carotid artery', 'right subclavian artery just downstream of the origin of the right common carotid artery', 'downstream of the origin of the right common carotid artery', 'distal infra-clavicular subclavian artery', 'site of the catheter entrance into the subclavian artery', 'subclavian artery', 'subclavian artery', 'mediastinum', 'Right sided pelvic', 'pelvic arterial anatomy', 'pelvic', 'distal aortic', 'right femoral artery', 'right common femoral artery', 'right axillary artery', 'right subclavian artery', 'subclavian artery', 'right internal mammary artery', 'mammary artery', 'right vertebral artery', 'subclavian artery', 'right groin', 'groin', 'Right arm', 'right leg', 'peripheral vascular', 'neurologic']","['arterial wave-form arising from the sheath tracing', 'inadvertently catheterized', 'arterial bleeding', 'compress the arterial puncture site', 'normal infra-clavicular subclavian artery', '8.5 F sheath had actually entered via the ventral aspect of the right subclavian artery just downstream of the origin of the right common carotid artery', 'punctured', 'spasm', 'extravasation of contrast', 'proximal entry point of this catheter into the subclavian artery', 'impediments', 'patent stent-graft', 'occlusion', 'contrast extravasation', 'subclavian artery bleeding', 'hemodynamically stable', 'right groin sheath was extracted', 'groin hemostasis', 'pulses were all palpable', 'hemorrhage', 'sequelae']",[],"['77', 'interventional radiology', 'angiography suite', 'operating room', 'Intensive Care Unit', 'ICU', 'ICU', 'ward', 'ICU']","['aortic valve replacement', 'tandem aorto-coronary bypass graft surgery', 'general anesthetic', 'venous sheath placement', 'venous sheath placement', 'ultrasound guided venous access', '8.5 F sheath was implanted', 'sheath was left in situ', 'extracted', 'aortic valve replacement', 'aorto-coronary bypass surgery', 'surgical procedure to extract the sheath', 'dissection', 'resection', 'angiography', 'placement of a stent-graft in the infraclavicular subclavian artery', 'general anesthetic', 'Right femoral artery access was achieved', '6 F groin sheath was placed', 'angiographic imaging', 'Injections of the right innominate artery', 'angiographic images', '8.5 F sheath was directly injected with contrast agent', 'angiographic images', 'surgical exploration of the mediastinum', 'Right sided pelvic angiography', 'placement of a stent-graft', 'stent-graft placement', '6 F right femoral artery sheath was removed', '12 F right common femoral artery sheath was implanted to accommodate the stent-graft', 'exchange length Amplatz guide wire was situated with the tip in the right axillary artery', 'post-implantation angiography']",[]
435,1526733-1,16824207,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1526733.xml,Isolated metachronous splenic metastasis from synchronous colon cancer,"A 76-year-old man suffering from fatigue, weight loss and rectal bleeding underwent extended left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of synchronous colon cancer. Preoperative work-up including colonoscopy and contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed that the tumors located at the left flexure and the sigmoid colon and the endoscopic biopsies revealed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma for both of the tumors. There was neither liver nor other remote site metastasis in the abdomen. The chest X-ray was normal. However, CEA level was higher (34.63 ng/mL, Reference values: 0–10 ng/mL) in the preoperative period (Figure ). Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, 2 cm in diameter, that invaded into but not beyond the muscularis propria (pT2) at the left flexure with lymphatic and vascular but not perineural invasion and another moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, 6 cm in diameter, that invaded into the serosa (pT3) with lymphatic, vascular and perineural invasion. Both of the tumors had similar histologic features that were well differentiated and complex glands composed of stratified columnar cells with eosinophilic cytoplasms accompanied by large necrotic areas. Four of the nine lymph nodes were positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma with the presence of perinodal invasion (pN2). Therefore, the patient was classified as stage C2 according to the modified Astler-Coller staging system and stage IIIC (pT3N2, cT3N2M0) according to the TNM system. He received oral chemotherapy consisting of capecitabine (Xeloda®, Roche) 5 × 500 mg capsule for 14 days with 7-day interval for a total of 8 courses. Blood CEA level decreased to the 3.54 ng/mL in the early postoperative period and remained normal up to the 14th month of follow-up. A rising CEA level (Figure ) in this asymptomatic case necessitated further imaging studies including abdominal ultrasound and contrast-enhanced abdominal and thoracic CT which revealed a hyperdense solid mass in the lower two third of the spleen, while the liver and the paraaortic area were disease-free. Furthermore, 18FDG- PET scanning showed an isolated hypermetabolic state in the spleen (Figure ), while PET-CT fusion scanning confirmed this pathological FDG uptake as superimposing with the hypodense mass in the spleen (Figure ). Any other remote organ metastases were not found by both CT and PET scanning. Following a preoperative vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis as prevention strategy to avoid overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, the patient underwent splenectomy 17 months after his previous colorectal cancer surgery. At laparotomy, the tumor was in the lower two third of the spleen without any capsule invasion macroscopically (Figure ) and there were neither liver nor other intraabdominal organ metastases. Also, any lymph node involvement at splenic hilus or paraaortic site was not detected during the operation. Therefore, lymphadenectomy at either site was not performed. Histopathologic examination of the splenectomy specimen showed that the tumor within the spleen was a metastasis of a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with 5 × 6 × 6.5 cm in dimensions and it was sharply demarcated from the adjacent splenic parenchyma without any capsule invasion (Figure ). The histologic features of this metastatic tumor were very similar to the primary synchronous colonic adenocarcinomas (Figure ). Because the patient had a previous colon cancer surgery and no findings of any primary tumor (i.e. adenocarcinoma) in any other organ except metastatic splenic tumor at laparotomy as well as on the preoperative CT and PET scanning besides the decrease of the high blood CEA level to within normal limits following splenectomy and the presence of histologic similarities between the metastatic tumor and the primaries, the present case was accepted as a solitary metachronous splenic metastasis from colon cancer. The postoperative period was uneventful. The patient has been symptom-free during the one-year of follow-up with a normal blood CEA levels, although he did not accept to receive any further adjuvant therapy.","[[76.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['rectal', 'colon', 'abdominal', 'left flexure', 'sigmoid colon', 'liver', 'remote site', 'abdomen', 'chest', 'muscularis propria', 'left flexure', 'lymphatic', 'perineural', 'serosa', 'lymphatic', 'perineural', 'complex glands', 'glands', 'Four of the nine lymph nodes', 'abdominal', 'abdominal', 'thoracic', 'lower two third of the spleen', 'liver', 'paraaortic area', 'spleen', 'spleen', 'organ', 'colorectal', 'lower two third of the spleen', 'capsule', 'liver', 'intraabdominal organ', 'lymph node', 'splenic hilus', 'paraaortic site', 'spleen', 'adjacent splenic parenchyma', 'capsule', 'colonic', 'colon', 'splenic', 'splenic', 'colon']","['fatigue', 'weight loss', 'rectal bleeding', 'synchronous colon cancer', 'tumors', 'adenocarcinoma', 'tumors', 'metastasis', 'adenocarcinoma', 'invasion', 'adenocarcinoma', 'invasion', 'tumors', 'complex glands', 'stratified columnar cells', 'eosinophilic cytoplasms', 'necrotic areas', 'metastatic adenocarcinoma', 'perinodal invasion', 'rising CEA level', 'asymptomatic', 'solid mass', 'disease-free', 'hypermetabolic state', 'pathological FDG uptake', 'hypodense mass', 'remote organ metastases', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Haemophilus influenzae', 'Neisseria meningitidis', 'overwhelming postsplenectomy infection', 'colorectal cancer', 'tumor', 'capsule invasion', 'metastases', 'lymph node involvement', 'tumor', 'adenocarcinoma', 'capsule invasion', 'metastatic tumor', 'synchronous colonic adenocarcinomas', 'colon cancer', 'primary tumor', 'adenocarcinoma', 'metastatic splenic tumor', 'high blood CEA level to within normal limits', 'metastatic tumor', 'metastatic tumor and the primaries', 'solitary metachronous splenic metastasis', 'colon cancer', 'postoperative period was uneventful', 'symptom-free']","['capecitabine', 'Xeloda®']",['76'],"['extended left hemicolectomy', 'work-up', 'colonoscopy', 'contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT)', 'endoscopic biopsies', 'chest X-ray', 'CEA level', 'Histopathological examination', 'chemotherapy', 'Blood CEA level', 'CEA level', 'imaging studies', 'abdominal ultrasound', 'contrast-enhanced abdominal and thoracic CT', '18FDG- PET scanning', 'PET-CT fusion scanning', 'CT', 'PET scanning', 'vaccination', 'splenectomy', 'colorectal cancer surgery', 'laparotomy', 'lymphadenectomy', 'Histopathologic examination', 'colon cancer surgery', 'laparotomy', 'CT', 'PET scanning', 'high blood CEA level', 'blood CEA level', 'splenectomy', 'blood', 'blood CEA levels', 'adjuvant therapy']","['Preoperative', 'preoperative', 'preoperative', 'preoperative', 'one-year']"

A case report,"A 72-year-old man, who had been suffering from right hip pain for 7 years when walking, was referred to our institute. Roentogenography of the right pelvic bone showed an expansion of the cortical contour and a soft-tissue mass with punctate calcification (figure ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a lobulated lesion expanding over the entire right pelvic bone with low-intensity on T1-weighted imaging and iso- to high-intensity on T2-weighted imaging, with the tumor protuberant to the pelvic cavity (figure ). Right hemipelvectomy was carried out. Histological sections showed a conventional chondrosarcoma having atypical chondrocytes with hyaline cartilage matrix or myxoid matrix (figure ). In a small section, dedifferentiated components were also identified, and these dedifferentiated components consisted of atypical spindle cells arranged in short fascicles or a storiform pattern showing MFH-like features, plus some pleomorphic cells with lace-like osteoid formation showing osteosarcoma-like features (figure ). Therefore, the final diagnosis was dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma because of the coexistence of conventional chondrosarcoma and dedifferentiated components.
Preoperative laboratory data were not remarkable. After surgery, the laboratory data also showed leukocytosis predominantly in the neutrophils with an elevated level of C-reactive protein (figure ). The serum level of G-CSF was also elevated (330 pg/ml [normal, <8 pg/ml]). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) revealed evidence of local recurrence and metastatic lesions in the lungs. Flow-cytometry indicated no evidence of leukemia and serological studies showed no evidence of specific infections, such as candidiasis or tuberculosis. Despite the administration of several antibiotics, the leukocytosis did not disappear. Two months after the surgery, the patient died of multiple organ failure. An autopsy was carried out, and in addition to the lung metastasis, metastasis was also found in the liver, thyroid, diaphragm, adrenal gland, digestive tract and skin. The histology of the recurrent and metastatic lesions was not conventional chondrosarcoma but only dedifferentiated components. Immunoexpression of G-CSF (anti-G-CSF [Ab1], Calbiochem, San Diego CA, USA) was seen in the dedifferentiated components, but not in the conventional chondrosarcoma components (figure ).","[[72.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['right hip', 'right pelvic bone', 'cortical contour', 'soft-tissue', 'right pelvic bone', 'pelvic cavity', 'cartilage matrix', 'spindle cells', 'short fascicles', 'fascicles', 'lungs', 'organ', 'lung', 'liver', 'thyroid', 'diaphragm', 'adrenal gland', 'digestive tract', 'skin']","['right hip pain', 'expansion of the cortical contour', 'soft-tissue mass', 'punctate calcification', 'calcification', 'lobulated lesion', 'tumor protuberant', 'conventional chondrosarcoma', 'atypical chondrocytes', 'hyaline cartilage matrix', 'myxoid matrix', 'dedifferentiated components', 'dedifferentiated components', 'atypical spindle cells', 'short fascicles', 'storiform pattern', 'MFH-like features', 'pleomorphic cells', 'osteoid formation', 'osteosarcoma-like features', 'dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma', 'conventional chondrosarcoma', 'dedifferentiated components', 'leukocytosis predominantly in the neutrophils', 'local recurrence', 'metastatic lesions', 'leukemia', 'specific infections', 'candidiasis', 'tuberculosis', 'leukocytosis', 'died', 'organ failure', 'lung metastasis', 'metastasis', 'metastatic lesions', 'conventional chondrosarcoma', 'dedifferentiated components', 'Immunoexpression of G-CSF']",[],"['72', 'San Diego CA, USA']","['Roentogenography of the right pelvic bone', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'MRI', 'Right hemipelvectomy', 'Histological sections', 'laboratory data', 'laboratory data', 'C-reactive protein', 'serum level of G-CSF', 'G-CSF', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'computed tomography (CT)', 'Flow-cytometry', 'serological studies', 'antibiotics', 'surgery', 'autopsy', 'histology', 'Immunoexpression of G-CSF', 'anti-G-CSF', 'Calbiochem']","['7 years', 'Preoperative', 'Two months']"

She had a history of treatment with oral acetazolamide, 4% pilocarpine drops and underwent laser iridotomy in the left eye. There was no previous history of such episodes. At presentation (Fig. , Top), both eyes had light perception vision, intraocular pressure (IOP) was 50 and 54 mmHg in the right and left eye respectively. The left eye had a mid-peripheral patent laser iridotomy (Figure , top right). The anterior chambers were nearly flat (Figure , bottom left), with diffuse pigmentation on the posterior corneal and anterior lens surface (Figure , bottom right). Both eyes showed signs of acute angle closure (Figure , top), with iris atrophy, glaucomflecken and prominent iris vessels (Figure , top right) and closed angles on indentation gonioscopy (Figure , bottom right). Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM) showed an anteriorly displaced crystalline lens with extensive irido-lenticular contact and peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) closing the angles completely in both eyes (Figure , top). Retinoscopy was tried, but was not possible owing to the poor fundal glow due to diffuse pigmentation on the posterior corneal surface. The axial length was 21.63 mm and 22.52 mm in the right and left eye respectively. B-Scan ultrasonography showed normal posterior segments in both eyes.
The patient was given Injection Mannitol 20% 350 ml stat. followed by systemic acetazolamide 250 mg four-times-a day, Syrup Glycerol 30 ml thrice-a-day, topical timolol maleate 0.5% twice-a-day and Brimonidine 0.15% twice-a-day. Pilocarpine was withheld since the iris-lens diaphragm was anteriorly displaced. The IOP reduced to 34 and 38 mmHg respectively.
There was no history suggestive of any of the reported causes of bilateral acute angle closure such as psychotropic drug intake [-] general anesthesia [] or snake bite []. A possibility of ciliary block glaucoma owing to prolonged unrelieved angle closure was kept in mind [,]. Atropine sulphate1% drops were added thrice a day, following which the acute congestive phase was relieved with regression of the prominent iris vessels seen during the acute phase (Figure , bottom). Following atropine treatment, the IOP further reduced to 30 and 34 mm Hg and the patient was symptomatically better (Figure , top left).
This response to cycloplegic treatment strengthened the possibility of a ciliary block glaucoma, and the patient underwent a pars-plana lensectomy and anterior vitrectomy (PPL-AV) in the left eye. Intraoperatively, under pupillary dilatation, the lens was found to be small and spherical (Fig , top right), suggestive of microspherophakia. Following surgery (Fig , bottom left), the IOP reduced to 12 mm Hg without medication with total relief of symptoms.
The right eye was re-examined under dilatation. The lens was small and spherical with the lens edge seen within the pupillary margin (Fig , bottom right). Microspherophakia was diagnosed in retrospect, with prolonged inverse angle closure glaucoma. We assessed the patient with particular reference to systemic conditions associated with spherophakia, such as Weill-Marchesani's syndrome, Marfan's syndrome and homocystinemia. She was of average height (155 cm), and moderately built. She had normal skeletal proportions with no evidence of arachnodactyly, short and stubby fingers or reduced joint mobility. There was no anterior chest deformity or scoliosis. The cardiovascular examination was within normal limits. Urine chromatography for homocystinuria was negative.
The patient underwent PPL-AV in the right eye. At last follow-up six weeks later, the IOP in both eyes remained controlled without anti-glaucoma medication (Figure , top), with pale optic discs secondary to prolonged ischemia (Figure , bottom). Post-operative gonioscopy showed the angles to have partially opened in both eyes (Figure ). The best-corrected-visual-acuity was counting fingers close to face in both eyes with refractive correction of +11. and +11.0 Diopters in the right and left eye respectively.
Despite our best efforts, the patient could not be contacted in rural Nepal for subsequent follow-ups.

On physical examination, she was moderately dehydrated and her temperature was 39.6°C. Her pulse was 110/minute, blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg and there was no pallor or icterus. On abdominal examination, there was generalized tenderness, guarding, rigidity and rebound tenderness. Shifting dullness and fluid thrill was present. The uterine fundal height corresponded to 30 weeks gestation. Bowel sounds were absent. Routine laboratory tests revealed hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, total leukocyte count of 18850 cells per mL. The blood sugar, kidney and liver function tests were normal. The chest X ray was normal and there was no free air under the diaphragm. Abdominal sonography revealed bowel loops floating in large amount of free fluid. A Single live foetus of 30 weeks gestation was seen. Gall bladder with multiple calculi and wall thickness of 4 mm was also noted. Paracentesis yielded a free flow of purulent fluid admixed with bile.

Report of two cases and review of literature,"A 21-year-old primipara with 32 weeks pregnancy was referred to us from the gynecology department with upper abdominal pain and high-grade fever for 3 days associated with abdominal distension. On examination, the patient had a pulse of 124/minute and her blood pressure was 96/64 mmHg. Mild pallor was noted and there was no icterus, lymphadenopathy or pedal edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had generalized tenderness, guarding, rigidity and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were absent. The uterine fundal height corresponded to 32 weeks' gestation. Routine laboratory tests revealed hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, total leukocyte count of 14100 cells per mL. The blood sugar, kidney and liver function tests were normal. Abdominal sonography showed a viable fetus of 32 weeks gestation. There was a large collection of fluid in the right side of peritoneal cavity below the liver. Other viscera were normal. Ultrasound guided diagnostic aspiration of the collection revealed frank bile, the presence of which confirmed by biochemical analysis of the fluid. With the presumptive diagnosis of duodenal ulcer perforation peritonitis, the patient was taken up for an exploratory laparotomy. There was an 800 mL collection of bile in the subhepatic and right paracolic space. The stomach and intestines were normal. The gall bladder was distended and a 0.5 × 0.5 cm perforation in the lateral wall of the supraduodenal portion of the CBD was seen. There was no evidence of gall stones. The CBD perforation was closed over a T-tube. The midline incision was closed after inserting a drain in the subhepatic space. The patient went into spontaneous labor 48 hours later and a preterm baby was delivered. Subsequently, on 15th postoperative day, after a normal T-tube cholangiogram (figure ), the T-tube was removed and the patient was discharged the next day.

He was unable to flex his knee more than 90°. He did not report any trauma, and serology did not reveal any metabolic or rheumatic conditions.
Clinical examination revealed a firm, nodular mass medial to the patellar tendon. The range of motion of the knee joint was limited to 90° of active flexion, with full extension. Neurovascular examination was normal. Plain radiographs showed a well delineated mass in the anterior portion of the knee. The femoral condyles and tibial plateau were normal (Fig. ). The mass was well circumscribed, and was likely to consist of cancellous bone with small areas of radiolucency. MRI confirmed the presence of a pedicle, but there was no continuity with the tibial plateau. The mass was lying in the Hoffa body with the cap in close contact with the medial articular joint space, elevating and displacing anteriorly the medial one third of the patellar tendon (Fig. ).
Under regional anaesthesia with the patient supine in a bloodless field furnished by a tight tourniquet, a 5 cm longitudinal incision was made medially to the patellar tendon. The mass lied medially and behind the patellar tendon in Hoffa body. It was dissected and excised. The medial tibial plateau and the patellar tendon were not involved in the process. The capsule and the skin were sutured with subcuticular undyed 3/0 vicryl (Ethicon, Edinburgh, UK, EH11 4HE) and steristrips (3M, Loughborough, UK, LE11 1EP). A non adherent dressing, velband and crepe bandage were applied. Weight bearing was allowed in the immediate post-operative period.
Post-operative recovery was uneventful. The patient returned to his activities of daily living, and regained full flexion two weeks after the procedure. When last reviewed 24 months after the excision, he was asymptomatic, with no clinical and radiographic signs of recurrence of the lesion (Fig. ).
The firm mass showed a nodular appearance with a diameter of 7 cm with sharply demarcated edges (Fig. ). Microscopic examination showed a cap of mature hyaline cartilaginous tissue covered by a fibrous membrane. The centre of the lesion consisted of mature bone trabeculae located beneath the cartilaginous cap containing bone marrow and amorphous calcified debris. At the interface between mature bone and well-differentiated cartilaginous cap, there were foci of active endochondral ossification. There was no evidence of malignant features, and absence of mitotic activity (Fig. ).","[[53.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['left anterior knee', 'knee', 'medial to the patellar tendon', 'knee joint', 'Neurovascular', 'anterior portion of the knee', 'femoral condyles', 'tibial', 'tibial plateau', 'bone', 'pedicle', 'tibial plateau', 'Hoffa body', 'medial articular joint space', 'medially to the patellar tendon', 'medially and behind the patellar tendon in Hoffa body', 'patellar tendon in Hoffa body', 'medial tibial plateau', 'patellar tendon', 'capsule', 'skin', 'hyaline cartilaginous tissue', 'fibrous membrane', 'bone', 'cartilaginous cap', 'bone marrow', 'mature bone', 'cartilaginous cap', 'endochondral']","['left anterior knee pain', 'unable to flex his knee', 'trauma', 'metabolic or rheumatic conditions', 'nodular mass medial to the patellar tendon', 'range of motion of the knee joint was limited to 90° of active flexion', 'mass', 'mass', 'cancellous bone', 'radiolucency', 'presence of a pedicle', 'continuity', 'mass', 'cap in close contact', 'mass', 'Post-operative recovery was uneventful', 'regained full flexion', 'asymptomatic', 'lesion', 'mass', 'cap of mature hyaline cartilaginous tissue covered by a fibrous membrane', 'lesion', 'bone trabeculae', 'amorphous calcified debris', 'endochondral ossification', 'malignant features', 'mitotic activity']",[],['53'],"['serology', 'Clinical examination', 'Plain radiographs', 'MRI', 'regional anaesthesia', '5 cm longitudinal incision was made medially to the patellar tendon', 'dissected', 'dissected and excised', 'excised', 'non adherent dressing', 'velband and crepe bandage were applied', 'Weight bearing', 'excision', 'Microscopic examination']","['three year', 'Post-operative', 'two weeks', '24 months']"
442,1538603-1,16824232,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1538603.xml,Good outcome after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and extended surgical resection for a large radiation-induced high-grade breast sarcoma,"A 44-year-old woman was admitted in May 2002 at our unit with a fast growing tumour in her left breast. Clinical evaluation revealed a lesion more than 10 cm in its maximum diameter, occupying the whole breast. The tumour had grossly infiltrated the skin and was fixed to the chest wall (figure and ). Incisional biopsy revealed the tumour to have high-grade spindle cell morphology and negative epithelial immunohistochemical markers, compatible with sarcoma (figure ).
Subsequent thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an expansive lesion of left breast and chest wall origin, infiltrating the skin and invading the pectoralis major and minor muscles, and the 7th – 9th ribs (figures and ). Thoracic and abdominal Computed Tomography did not identify any metastases.
The patient had been treated seven years earlier for a left breast ductal carcinoma T1N0M0 invasive, and well differentiated. The treatment had consisted of a local 1.5 cm tumour excision in the left superior quadrant of the left breast with ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection. Histological examination of the 29 lymph nodes excised was negative for malignant cells. Post-operative external beam radiotherapy was initiated 27 days after the surgery. It was applied to the remaining left breast, left axilla, supraclavicular fossa and internal mammary chain lymph nodes. The total 55 Gy radiation dose was delivered in 25 fractions, during a 5-week period, using a 3-field technique, in a Cobalt unit. The treatment ended in August 1994 with no adjuvant chemotherapy, and she had remained disease-free.
Neoadjuvant treatment for the high-grade sarcoma was initiated in June 2002, together with intravenous epirubicin, in a bolus dose of 60 mg/m2 from day D1 to D2, and ifosfamide, intravenous dose of 1800 mg/m2 from day D1 to D5 [,]. Anaemia, leucopoenia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were the main adverse effects, with decreased leukocyte counts to 400 per mm3. Four sessions of chemotherapy were taken with 21-day intervals. At the end of the second session, clinical evidences of approximately 20% decrease in tumour diameter and resolution of the adjacent satellite lesions were observed.
Surgery was performed in October 31st, 2002, according to oncological standards. Total radical mastectomy with chest wall en bloc resection was carried out. The oncological principle was to totally excise the tumour-infiltrated tissue with cancer cell-free margins of at least 2 cm. A large portion of the skin extending from the sternum to the left axilla and from the left clavicle to the 10th left rib was resected. As the dissection was taken deep, the breast, pectoralis major and minor muscles, part of the serratus anterior muscle and the 7th to 9th ribs and pleura were removed en bloc (figure and ). A large soft tissue and chest wall defect required surgical reconstruction.
The principles of chest wall reconstruction were to provide obliteration of intra-thoracic dead space, skeletal stabilization and adequate soft tissue coverage. A 20 × 10 cm prolene mesh, covered by transposition and rotation of well vascularized regional muscle flaps, was used for skeletal stabilization. The mobilized muscles were the contralateral pectoralis major, keeping free the serratus anterior and the ipsilateral latissimus dorsi muscles. Adequate soft tissue coverage was achieved advancing and rotating an extensive thoracic-abdominal fasciocutaneous flap (figure ). The reconstruction maintained normal respiration physiology, protected thoracic viscera and provided soft tissue coverage.
Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed a 9.5 × 9.0 × 8.5 cm high-grade breast and chest wall sarcoma invading the skin anteriorly and three ribs, pectoralis muscles and portion of the serratus muscle posteriorly. Histological evaluation revealed marked cytological and nuclear pleomorphism, often with bizarre tumour giant cells, occasionally multinuclear, combined with spindle cells and necrosis. Immunohistochemical examination showed tumour cells were reactive for vimentin. Stains were negative for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), actin (HHF-35, IA4), calponin, myo-D1, S100 protein, CD34 and CD31. These immunohistochemical and histopathological findings allowed a diagnosis of undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma).
Presence of 20% of necrosis in the surgical specimen was an important finding of the histological examination, which had not been observed at incisional biopsy performed prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (figure ).
The patient is currently in good health with no recurrence and breast reconstruction is being planned.","[[44.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['left breast', 'whole breast', 'skin', 'chest wall', 'spindle cell', 'thoracic', 'left breast', 'chest wall', 'chest wall origin', 'skin', 'pectoralis major and minor muscles', 'Thoracic', 'abdominal', 'left breast ductal', 'left superior quadrant of the left breast', 'left breast', 'ipsilateral axillary lymph node', 'left breast', 'left axilla', 'supraclavicular fossa', 'internal mammary chain lymph nodes', 'lymph nodes', 'Total radical', 'chest wall', 'tissue', 'skin', 'sternum', 'left axilla', 'left clavicle', '10th left rib', 'breast', 'pectoralis major and minor muscles', 'part of the serratus anterior muscle', '7th to 9th ribs', 'pleura', 'soft tissue', 'chest wall', 'chest wall', 'intra-thoracic', 'intra-thoracic dead space', 'skeletal', 'soft tissue', 'mobilized muscles', 'contralateral pectoralis major', 'serratus anterior', 'ipsilateral latissimus dorsi muscles', 'soft tissue', 'thoracic-abdominal fasciocutaneous flap', 'thoracic viscera', 'soft tissue', 'breast', 'chest wall', 'skin anteriorly', 'three ribs', 'pectoralis muscles', 'portion of the serratus muscle posteriorly', 'breast']","['tumour', 'lesion', 'tumour', 'tumour', 'epithelial immunohistochemical markers', 'sarcoma', 'lesion', 'infiltrating the skin', 'invading', 'metastases', 'left breast ductal carcinoma', 'tumour', 'malignant cells', 'disease-free', 'sarcoma', 'Anaemia', 'leucopoenia', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'diarrhoea', 'adverse effects', 'tumour diameter', 'adjacent satellite lesions', 'tumour-infiltrated tissue', 'cancer cell-free margins', 'defect', 'intra-thoracic dead space', 'skeletal stabilization', 'normal respiration physiology', 'protected thoracic viscera', 'soft tissue coverage', 'sarcoma', 'cytological and nuclear pleomorphism', 'nuclear pleomorphism', 'tumour giant cells', 'multinuclear', 'spindle cells', 'necrosis', 'tumour cells were reactive for vimentin', 'pleomorphic sarcoma', 'pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma', 'necrosis', 'good health', 'recurrence']","['epirubicin', 'ifosfamide']","['44', 'May 2002', 'August 1994', 'June 2002', 'October 31st, 2002']","['Incisional biopsy', 'thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'MRI', 'Thoracic and abdominal Computed Tomography', 'treatment', 'local 1.5 cm tumour excision in the left superior quadrant of the left breast', 'ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection', 'Histological examination', 'lymph nodes excised', 'external beam radiotherapy', 'treatment', 'adjuvant chemotherapy', 'Neoadjuvant treatment', 'leukocyte counts', 'chemotherapy', 'Surgery', 'Total radical mastectomy', 'chest wall en bloc resection', 'totally excise the tumour-infiltrated tissue with cancer cell-free margins of at least 2 cm.', 'dissection was taken deep', 'removed en bloc', 'surgical reconstruction', 'chest wall reconstruction', 'Adequate soft tissue coverage was achieved advancing and rotating an extensive thoracic-abdominal fasciocutaneous flap', 'reconstruction maintained normal respiration physiology', 'Histopathological examination', 'Histological evaluation', 'Immunohistochemical examination', 'Stains', 'cytokeratin', 'actin', 'calponin', 'myo-D1', 'S100 protein', 'CD34', 'CD31', 'immunohistochemical', 'histopathological', 'histological examination', 'incisional biopsy', 'neoadjuvant chemotherapy', 'breast reconstruction']","['seven years earlier', 'Post-operative', 'August 1994', 'June 2002', 'from day D1 to D5', 'October 31st, 2002', 'currently']"

Two weeks previously, she had presented with an acute pharyngitis, which was treated with amoxicillin for 8 days. At admission, she presented with persistent lateral cervical pain, hyperleukocytosis (leukocyte count of 13,300/m-3, including 90% neutrophils) and a CRP at 450 mg/L, combined with an X-ray shadow on the bottom left lung. This led to a diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia. Blood samples were collected for culture and the patient benefited from treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and erythromycin.
After 48 hours in hospital, the blood cultures were positive for anaerobic Gram negative bacilli. Her antibiotic therapy was modified, to a combination of cefotaxime, gentamicin and metronizadole. Following the appearance of pain in the two hypochondria, a thoraco-abdominal CT scan was performed, which revealed a voluminous build-up of air and fluid in the left thorax (Fig ) and a heterogeneous hepato-splenomegaly. Within a few hours, the patient presented with a body temperature of 39°7, respiratory failure with hypotension and awareness disorders, requiring the use of mechanical ventilation and vascular filling with crystalloids followed by the administration of norepinephrine (1 μg/kg/min). She was diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome and transferred to the intensive care unit of a university hospital center.
At admission to the intensive care unit, the patient presented with severe ARDS, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 65 mmHg, PEEP14, bilateral alveolo-interstitial syndrome, left pyopneumothorax on chest x-ray (Fig ) and septic shock. Biologically, her CRP was 475 mg/L and her procalcitonine was 92 mg/L. A left thoracic drain was installed, which removed 350 ml of the purulent liquid. Mechanical ventilation was implemented according to the recommendations of the National Institutes of Health. Her antibiotic regimen was modified to a combination of imipenem/cilastatin (3000 mg/day) and metronidazole (1500 mg/day). An ACTH test was performed, which showed 840 nmol/Lat baseline and 895 nmol/L 1 hour after injection, and she was started on treatment with 300 mg/day hydrocortisone.
Four days later, a second set of thoracic, cerebral and abdominal CT scans was performed. In addition to the abscess of thelingula and the drained pyopneumothorax, these scans revealed a large number of small abscesses of the upper and median lobes of the right lung (Fig ), a stable appearance of the hepato-splenomegaly and a partial thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein, without any appearance of stroke.
The anaerobic Gram negative bacillus was identified as a Fusobacterium necrophorum sensitive to penicillin, and she was treated with penicillin G for 15 days. The patient improved, becoming apyretic and with normal blood pressure. Withdrawal of ventilation was started and the patient was weaned from the the respiratory asssitance after 3 days. She was discharged from the intensive care unit 12 days after admission.
Her DNA was assayed for SNPs previously incriminated in the detection of the pathogen, the inflammatory response and the coagulation cascade (Table ).

444,1538622-1,16734908,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1538622.xml,Intestinal strongyloidiasis and hyperinfection syndrome,"A 77 year old male veteran with past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and gastro esophageal reflux disease was found to have an incidental eosinophilia with 12.4% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count of 800 cells/mm3). He reported morning cough with small amounts of thick mucus. He denied any epistaxis, difficulty in breathing, abdominal pain, diarrhea and constipation. He had lived in North East Tennessee for almost 30 yrs. He was an ex-smoker but had ceased to smoke almost 30 years ago. On examination, he was an obese male with periorbital edema. Auscultation demonstrated a bruit just above the left sternoclavicular joint, but his chest was clear to auscultation. A midline scar consistent with previous coronary bypass grafting was seen. The rest of the examination was essentially benign.
Due to eosinophilia, a complete evaluation was carried out. Serological tests for strongyloidiasis were strongly positive with antibody titer of 12.2 (Normal titer < 1.0). Total serum levels of IgE and IgA were within-normal limits at 130 IU/mL and 243 mg/dL respectively and no Strongyloides stercoralis larvae or eggs were found in the stools as shown in the Table . He was given one dose of ivermectin (200 micrograms/kilogram) and the repeat labs, a month later, showed improved eosinophil percentage at 5.6% with a drop in the eosinophil count to 400 cells/mm3 along with drop in the strongyloid antibody titer to 6.76 (Normal titer < 1.0) as shown in the Table . Three months after treatment, his respiratory symptoms improved and one more dose of ivermectin (200 micrograms/Kg) was given for still elevated strongyloid antibody titer of 6.97 (normal titer < 1.0). Repeat labs, 4 months after the second treatment with ivermectin, showed decreased strongyloid antibody titer to 5.0 (normal titer < 1.0) with no eosinophilia and thus indicating a positive response to treatment (Table ).
This is a case of mildly symptomatic chronic strongyloidiasis with very few respiratory symptoms consisting of morning cough with small amounts of thick sputum, positive strongyloid antibody in the serum and negative larvae or eggs in the stool samples. This case also demonstrates the effectiveness of ivermectin in the treatment of strongyloidiasis.","[[77.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['pulmonary', 'coronary artery', 'coronary artery', 'gastro esophageal', 'abdominal', 'periorbital', 'left sternoclavicular joint', 'chest', 'coronary', 'respiratory', 'respiratory']","['chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'coronary artery disease', 'dyslipidemia', 'hypertension', 'gastro esophageal reflux disease', 'incidental eosinophilia', 'eosinophilia', 'cough', 'epistaxis', 'difficulty in breathing', 'abdominal pain', 'diarrhea', 'constipation', 'ex-smoker', 'obese', 'periorbital edema', 'bruit', 'clear to auscultation', 'midline scar', 'benign', 'eosinophilia', 'strongyloidiasis', 'Strongyloides stercoralis larvae or eggs', 'respiratory symptoms', 'eosinophilia', 'positive response to treatment', 'strongyloidiasis', 'respiratory symptoms', 'cough', 'thick sputum', 'positive strongyloid antibody', 'strongyloidiasis']","['ivermectin', 'ivermectin', 'ivermectin', 'ivermectin']","['77', 'veteran', 'North East Tennessee']","['coronary artery bypass graft', 'eosinophils', 'absolute eosinophil', 'absolute eosinophil count', 'coronary bypass grafting', 'Serological tests', 'strongyloidiasis', 'Total serum levels of IgE and IgA', 'labs', 'eosinophil percentage', 'eosinophil count', 'Normal titer', 'treatment', 'strongyloid antibody titer', 'normal titer', 'labs', 'strongyloid antibody', 'strongyloid antibody in the serum', 'serum', 'larvae or eggs in the stool samples']","['status post', 'morning', 'Three months', 'morning']"

She had no significant previous medical history, and was taking no medications. Examination was unremarkable. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm. Echocardiography gave a noisy recording but revealed a moderate sized pericardial effusion without haemodynamic compromise, dilated left atrium, and a suspicion of a right atrial mass. (Figure )
Chest x-ray revealed a grossly enlarged asymmetrical heart (cardiothoracic ratio 24.4/31.3), with enlargement of the right atrium. The appearances were thought to be in keeping with a tumour of pericardial or cardiac origin.
A contrast echocardiogram was performed; Sonovue contrast given for endocardial border definition revealed a 12 cm vascular mass superior to the right atrium, to the right of the sternum, likely to be attached to the pericardium. (Figure /).
Further imaging was undertaken, to define the location of the mass. A computerised tomography of the chest found a massive, heterogeneously enhancing mass outside the right atrium, directly abutting the right anterior pleural surface. The right inferior pulmonary vein was partly compressed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the chest however, suggested the mass was of intra atrial origin, as the right atrium was seen to have a concave interface with the mass, and there was distension of the atrial septum to the left. It was thought to be a myxoma (Figure ).
The mass was surgically resected. It measured 150 × 115 × 90 mm and weighed 830 grammes. It was found to be intrapericardial, lying in the right posterolateral pericardial space, compressing and deforming the right atrium. Histology revealed a benign fibrous tumour.

Due to the patient's debilitated state and risk for life threatening decompensation, the decision was made not to remove the gallbladder.
He was listed for liver transplantation as status 2A. On November 16th, 1999 an ABO compatible size matched organ was allocated to him. The transplant was performed with the conventional technique with venovenous bypass. In the explanted liver, a polypoid mass, which measured 1.5 × 0.5 cm, was found on the fundus of the gallbladder. Histological examination revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with full thickness penetration of the gallbladder encroaching (within millimeters) liver parenchyma. Angiolymphatic invasion was confirmed. (Figures , , ) Examination of the hepatic hilar lymph nodes, common duct, cystic duct and the remainder of the liver did not show any metastasis (T3N0M0, Stage IIA; AJCC 2002).
Extensive metastatic evaluation was also negative. The patient recovered uneventfully with triple immunosuppression (Tacrolimus, mycophenalate, and prednisone) and received no chemotherapy.
Patient was being followed closely in the liver transplant clinic and had normal liver function tests until his demise in June of 2006.

The patient was healthy till a few days before admission to the hospital, when he suffered constant oppressive chest pain.
Standard chest radiography followed by computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass measuring 15 cm in diameter, located in the anterior mediastinum with extension to the right hemithorax (Figure , ). MRI showed a contiguity between the mass and the bypass grafts without signs of invasion (Figure , ). Electrocardiography (EKG) and exercise stress test were also negative for cardiac disorders a coronary angiography was however performed to confirm the patency and functioning of the bypass.
The patient, whose symptoms worsened, was submitted to surgery without further investigations since it was thought that a preoperative histological determination would not change the therapeutic approach.
The surgical approach was a re-sternotomy with opening of the right pleural cavity. Exploration revealed a mass abutting sternal periosteum from which it could be separated. The mass extended from the aortic arch into the anterior mediastinum and most of the right pleural cavity without invading the lung. The main surgical problem was to be able to preserve aorto-coronary bypass which consisted of three venous grafts from ascending aorta to the main coronary vessels. The mass was isolated starting from the aortic arch, a dissection plane was there found, making it possible to separate the venous grafts. Right pericardium was however infiltrated and was removed permitting radical excision of the mass. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on seventh postoperative day.
The histological examination of the mass revealed a mesenchymal tumour with fibromixoid features, the ultrastructure of which was that of an aggressive fibromatosis (Figure ).

The patient had a history of smoking one pack per day and heavy alcohol use for many years. His medical history was significant for hypertension. An endoscopic biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction. Gross examination of the subsequent esophagogastrectomy specimen revealed a 5.5 × 3.0 × 1.2 cm fungating tumor, located at the gastroesophageal junction. The remaining gastric and esophageal mucosa appeared unremarkable. Sections of the tumor, random sections of uninvolved mucosa and other pertinent sections were examined after hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
On histopathology the tumor was diagnosed as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Light microscopic examination of random gastric sections revealed multiple small corpuscle like structures in the lamina propria close to the top of the gastric pits (Figure ). These corpuscles were round to oval in shape ranging in size from 99–330 microns in diameter approximately. Histologically they were comprised of elongated slender cells with slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and an oval to pale nucleus and were tightly packed in a lamellated arrangement with a well-circumscribed contour. Whorled and parallel-running fibers could also be identified. Adjacent gastric tissue had no significantly histopathological change.
To determine the nature of the cells forming these lamellated structures, we examined related cell membrane markers by using biotin-avitin immunohistochemical methods. The slides were stained with the following immunohistochemical stains: S-100, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), neuron specific enolase (NSE), nerofilament protein (NF), glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (MBP) and CD 57 (Dako Corporation, California).
These cells stained strongly positive with mouse monoclonal antibodies to human S-100 (Figure ), lightly positive by the antibody to NSE and stained negative with antibodies against EMA (Figure ), GFAP, NF, MBP and CD 57.
Ultrastructural studies were performed on formalin fixed tissue. Although the tissue was inadequately preserved for such an analysis, it revealed structures similar to the ones described in neurofibromas [,].

He was currently under the care of the haematology department with protein S deficiency. He had a history of DVT and PE in 1965 and received anticoagulation therapy with warfarin for a year. The diagnosis of protein S deficiency was made in 1993, after investigation for recurrent leg ulceration, and therapy with warfarin and subsequently low molecular weight heparin commenced.

A review of medical records during Mr. Ortiz' trial revealed that he was also Hepatitis C positive and that he had persistently low platelets for several years, irrespective of a fluctuating CD4+ level/HIV viral load. Although aware of his HIV infection since original diagnosis in the late 1990's, Mr. Ortiz was unaware of his hepatitis status until his trial when review of his records revealed a positive Hepatitis C test from a hospital visit after his most recent incarceration and shortly before his arrest on the burglary charge for which he was convicted. Mr. Ortiz reports regular medical care during his prior incarcerations, including diagnosis and treatment of his HIV but recalls no mention of liver disease []. This finding led Mr. Ortiz's defense team to seek further medical evaluation. Testimony by a consulting gastroenterologist was presented during the sentencing phase of the trial and identified Mr. Ortiz as having advanced Hepatitis C with platelets too low for biopsy []. Mr. Ortiz reports having used IV drugs 10–15 years prior to his recent trial which is consistent with the observation that approximately 70% of person's co-infected with HIV and Hepatitis C become infected via IVDU []. Given the slow progression of hepatitis C, even allowing for a hastened disease course in the setting of HIV infection, it is likely that Mr. Ortiz became infected at least ten years earlier. Over this period of time, Mr. Ortiz was known to have HIV and was being intermittently treated for HIV infection.
Aside from never learning of his Hepatitis C while incarcerated, another example of the burdens that the CJS may impose on individuals such as Mr. Ortiz is bias in sentencing. Because of his multiple criminal convictions, the Bronx District Attorney asked that the presiding Judge sentence Mr. Ortiz to a lengthy prison term as a 'persistent felony offender'. This rarely used statute allows a Judge to impose a sentence of 15 year to life, as opposed to whatever sentence would normally apply for their individual conviction []. In this case the burglary charge (even with the prior offenses) could have brought Mr. Ortiz as little as a 2 to 4 year sentence. Instead, the Judge held that Mr. Ortiz was a persistent felony offender and sentenced him to 15 years to life, noting that the ""Extensive medical testimony and other evidence established that it is questionable whether, even if I sentence him merely as a second felony offender to the minimum sentence of 2 to 4 years, he would still be alive at the expiration of his sentence"" (see ). He went on to explain that ""Given his weakened state, any assertion that the Defendant is a serious threat to the public as a burglar is really not credible. However, if released, he may well return to the life of a street addict, thereby endangering the public health through the exchange or sharing of dirty needles."" This despite the fact that during this trial, no evidence was introduced about Mr. Ortiz currently or recently using intravenous drugs. Other trial testimony available to the Judge indicates that Mr. Ortiz had last reported intravenous drug use over a decade before his trial. Yet the Judge concluded that incarceration in a state prison would provide ""a setting that will ensure that he takes his medications on schedule, and without resort to the use and sharing of dirty needles"" [].","[[45.0, 'year']]",M,2006,['liver'],"['burglary', 'Hepatitis C', 'low platelets', 'HIV infection', 'hepatitis', 'HIV', 'liver disease', 'Hepatitis C', 'used IV drugs', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis C', 'infected', 'IVDU', 'hepatitis C', 'HIV infection', 'infected', 'HIV', 'HIV infection', 'Hepatitis C', 'weakened state', 'using intravenous drugs', 'intravenous drug use']",[],"['Ortiz', '45-year', 'June 2005', 'Ortiz', '1990', 'Ortiz', 'Ortiz', 'Ortiz', 'Ortiz', 'Ortiz', 'Ortiz', 'Ortiz', 'Ortiz', 'Bronx District Attorney', 'Ortiz', '15', 'Ortiz', 'Ortiz', '15', 'burglar', 'public health', 'Ortiz', 'Ortiz']","['Hepatitis C', 'platelets', 'CD4+ level', 'HIV viral load', 'Hepatitis C test', 'medical care', 'treatment', 'platelets', 'biopsy', 'biopsy', 'medications']","['June 2005', 'several years', ""since original diagnosis in the late 1990's"", 'at least ten years earlier', 'currently', 'recently', 'over a decade']"

The past medical history was significant for higher PSA levels for 10 years without clinical relevance, an acute myocardial infarction which was treated with coronary arteries' stenting and an arterial occlusive disease (Fontaine IIb). The patient was submitted to surgery and a subtotal gastrectomy with a gastrojejunostomy and a partial liver resection were performed (pT2, pN1, pM1L (liver segment 2), N0, V0). No adjuvant chemotherapy was carried out.
During the follow-up a local recurrence has been detected in the abdominal CT-scan 24 months after surgery. The patient was then submitted to a total gastrectomy with Roux en Y esophagojejunostomy. A palliative chemotherapy (eloxatin, 5-fluoruracil, leukovorin) was performed for 10 months but no remission was observed. Twelve months later the CT-scan revealed a stable tumor disease despite chemotherapy adjacent to the hepatic artery. Then the patient underwent a palliative intravenous therapy with 2% taurolidine for seven days (per months) with a daily dose of 300 mg per kg body weight. After twelve cycles the CT-scan revealed a tumor mass reduction and the therapy was terminated. Three months later the patient experienced abdominal discomfort. Diagnostics showed one liver metastasis in segment 8 which was successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation (Figure ). The patient was treated with taurolidine monthly ever since. After the chemotherapy no. 32 an additional primary urothelial carcinoma in two different sites of the urinary tract (left kidney, urinary bladder) The lesion in the bladder was localy excized (pTa, G2) while the kidney lesion was put under observation by the urologists. After treatment with a total of 39 cycles with taurolidine the patient was in a good clinical condition and showed no life quality deficit. At this time the CT-scan (Figure ) showed no tumor progression next to the hepatic artery (stable disease). Four weeks after the completion of the treatment the patient was admitted to the urology department of our hospital in order to be submitted to surgical treatment of his urothelial carcinoma. A left nephrectomy was performed. Although there were no intraoperative problems the patient unexpectedly died of an acute myocardial infarct 48 hours after surgery.

Three months later he presented with a spontaneous fracture of the limb and required new surgical fixation due to infectious pseudoarthrosis. MRSA was isolated again. In October 2003 he was re-operated and underwent auto-transplantation of corticospongiosa. During these episodes he was given teicoplanin, cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, tetracycline and quinolones at intervals of 7 to 20 days at another institution in a distant site. Table shows the summary of the multiple events.
In June 2004 he was admitted to our institution with the above mentioned complaints. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a large vegetation (size 2.5 × 0.8 cm) on the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve (Figure ) and severe valve insufficiency, with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) disclosed other pathologic findings. A total body computed tomography scan was performed showing multiple bilateral areas suggesting pulmonary infarction (Figure ). A labelled leucocyte scintigraphy didn't reveal any specific infective localization.
The patient was treated with an association of oxacillin 16 gr/day and gentamycin 240 mg/day that was shifted two days later to teicoplanin (1200 mg/12 h/IV) for the first 3 days followed with 1200 mg/day/IV) and cotrimoxazole (480 mg/12 h/IV) as MRSA was isolated. The MRSA was resistant to clindamycin (MIC>8 mcg/ml), erythromycin (MIC>8 mcg/ml), gentamycin (MIC>16 mcg/ml), norfloxacin (MIC>16 mcg/ml), ofloxacin (MIC>8 mcg/ml), oxacillin (MIC>4 mcg/ml), penicillin (MIC>0.8 mcg/ml), and tobramycin (MIC>16 mcg/ml). The MRSA resulted susceptible to rifampicin (MIC<0.5 mcg/ml), teicoplanin (MIC<0.5 mcg/ml), tetracicline (MIC<1 mcg/ml), cotrimoxazole (MIC<10 mcg/ml) and vancomycin (MIC<1 mcg/ml). Linezolid 600 mg daily iv was started 8 days later because of worsening condition (Linezolid was not tested in-vitro). However this proved to be ineffective as the patient still presented fever and positive blood cultures for MRSA maintaining the same strains. A new TTE was performed showing the presence of a new vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve.
Linezolid was then replaced with vancomycin (500 mg/6 h/IV), rifampicin (600 mg/8 h/IV) and cotrimoxazole (480 mg/8 h/IV) that was again ineffective and after 12 days of therapy was suspended. After 27 days of ineffective therapy the patient condition was very poor; TTE showed new vegetations on the posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve with severe insufficiency and large pulmonary infarctions. Quinupristin/dalfopristin were at 7.5 mg-Kg/8 h/IV. After three days of therapy the patient became afebrile and his condition improved. After 25 days of therapy with quinupristin/dalfopristin, biological markers for infection became normal and the patient underwent left above-the-knee amputation as prevention treatment for new infections. The therapy with quinupristin/dalfopristin was suspended after 42 days. A Transesophageal echocardiography and a thoracic computed tomography scan were performed at the end of antibiotic therapy and at 18 months after discharge showed complete regression of the tricuspid vegetation, only mild valve insufficiency and absence of residual pulmonary infarction.
Infective endocarditis is an uncommon disease. A recent publication has shown that the incidence of IE is about 31 cases per million inhabitants. Right-sided IE represents 10% of all cases with tricuspid valve involvement in 90% of cases. Moss and Munt showed the right-sided IE is more frequent in drug-addicts (63%) [,]. We present a case of tricuspid IE complicated by multiple pulmonary septic infarctions originated probably from a focus of chronic osteomyelitis. The interesting aspect of this case is not only the acute clinic presentation but also the high grade of clinical resistance to the different antibiotic regimens used []. The patient did not respond to the use of glycopeptides, teicoplanin and vancomycin always in association with other drugs despite the positive in vitro susceptibility to these antibiotics []. The use of linezolid [], a wide spectrum antibiotic, with a very good reported action on the lungs [] resulted ineffective with a concomitant dramatic deterioration of the clinical condition of the patient. The use of quinupristin/dalfopristin [] as salvage therapy resulted in a very quick improvement after three days and resulted in complete cure of tricuspid valve IE and septic embolic lung abscesses. The antibiotic therapy was continued for four weeks as recommended by the American Heart Association guidelines [] for complicated right-sided endocarditis diminishing the rate of relapses due. The decision to perform a left above-the-knee amputation was considered as the only possible guarantee of removal of chronic osteomyelitis focus and was performed with the patient on quinupristin/dalfopristin antibiotic treatment.","[[50.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['xyphoid process', 'Chest', 'Abdominal', 'right above-the-knee', 'limb', 'limb', 'anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve', 'valve', 'left ventricular', 'total body', 'bilateral areas', 'pulmonary', 'anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve', 'posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve', 'pulmonary', 'left above-the-knee', 'Transesophageal', 'thoracic', 'tricuspid', 'valve', 'pulmonary', 'tricuspid valve', 'tricuspid', 'pulmonary', 'lungs', 'tricuspid valve', 'lung', 'left above-the-knee']","['non-insulin dependant diabetic', 'fever', 'poor general status', 'diastolic murmur', 'abnormalities', 'splenomegaly', 'road traffic accident', 'trauma', 'osteomyelitis of this limb', 'MRSA', 'spontaneous fracture of the limb', 'infectious pseudoarthrosis', 'MRSA', 'corticospongiosa', 'events', 'complaints', 'vegetation', 'valve insufficiency', 'pulmonary infarction', 'specific infective localization', 'infective localization', 'MRSA', 'MRSA', 'MRSA', 'worsening condition', 'fever', 'MRSA', 'vegetation', 'condition was very poor', 'vegetations', 'insufficiency', 'pulmonary infarctions', 'afebrile', 'condition improved', 'infection', 'infections', 'tricuspid vegetation', 'valve insufficiency', 'pulmonary infarction', 'Infective endocarditis', 'IE', 'Right-sided IE', 'tricuspid valve involvement', 'right-sided IE', 'tricuspid IE', 'pulmonary septic infarctions', 'osteomyelitis', 'clinical resistance', 'improvement', 'tricuspid valve IE', 'septic embolic lung abscesses', 'right-sided endocarditis', 'osteomyelitis focus']","['teicoplanin', 'cotrimoxazole', 'rifampicin', 'tetracycline', 'quinolones', 'oxacillin', 'gentamycin', 'teicoplanin', 'cotrimoxazole', 'clindamycin', 'erythromycin', 'gentamycin', 'norfloxacin', 'ofloxacin', 'oxacillin', 'penicillin', 'tobramycin', 'rifampicin', 'teicoplanin', 'tetracicline', 'cotrimoxazole', 'vancomycin', 'Linezolid', 'Linezolid', 'Linezolid', 'vancomycin', 'rifampicin', 'cotrimoxazole', 'Quinupristin', 'dalfopristin', 'quinupristin', 'dalfopristin', 'quinupristin', 'dalfopristin', 'glycopeptides', 'teicoplanin', 'vancomycin', 'linezolid', 'quinupristin', 'dalfopristin', 'quinupristin', 'dalfopristin']","['50', '3/6', 'June 2000', 'June 2002', 'October 2003', 'June 2004']","['Chest X-ray', 'Abdominal ultrasound', 'right above-the-knee amputation', 'orthopaedic fixation of the left lower limb', 'antibiotics', 'Prosthetic shafts were removed', 'MRSA isolated', 'surgical fixation', 'MRSA was isolated', 'auto-transplantation of corticospongiosa', 'Transthoracic echocardiography', 'TTE', 'left ventricular ejection', 'left ventricular ejection fraction', 'Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)', 'total body computed tomography scan', 'labelled leucocyte scintigraphy', 'MIC', 'MIC', 'MIC', 'MIC', 'MIC', 'MIC', 'MIC', 'MIC', 'MIC', 'MIC', 'MIC', 'in-vitro', 'blood cultures', 'TTE', 'therapy', 'ineffective therapy', 'TTE', 'therapy', 'therapy', 'biological markers for infection', 'left above-the-knee amputation', 'prevention treatment', 'Transesophageal echocardiography', 'thoracic computed tomography scan', 'antibiotic therapy', 'Moss and Munt', 'antibiotic regimens', 'vitro', 'vitro susceptibility', 'antibiotics', 'antibiotic', 'salvage therapy', 'antibiotic therapy', 'left above-the-knee amputation', 'removal of chronic osteomyelitis focus', 'antibiotic treatment']","['three-day', 'June 2000', 'June 2002', 'Three months later', 'October 2003', 'October 2003', 'after three days']"

Her general condition was poor revealing severely ill patient. She was febrile up to 39°C, dyspnoic, exhausted, with strenuous dry cough, with Body Mass Index 12, with hypoproteine pitting edema of lower extremities. Respiratory sounds were diminished on the left side. Physical exam of the abdomen revealed rigidity and guarding at the left hypochondrial quadrant. Abdominal sounds were diminished. Laboratory findings at presentation were: Hemoglobin 85 g/L; Leukocytes 24,2 × 109/L; Platelets 110 × 109/L; Albumin 26 g/L; Sed. rate 76/h. She suffered from Crohn's colitis since 1999 when the diagnosis was established and was occasionally on peroral therapy with Budesonid and Salofalk combined with Salofalk enemas. She experienced three severe attacks during the course of the disease which required hospitalization and aggressive medical treatment prior the operation. Colonoscopy performed one year prior the operation revealed Crohn's colitis from anal canal to the level of transverse colon, with serpiginous ulcerations and narrowed lumen.
Chest radiography showed hydropneumothorax on the left side (figure ). Thoracocentesis was immediately performed and revealed feculent effusion. It was followed with the chest tube insertion in the left pleural space. Total of 3500 ml of feculent smelling fluid was drained out of the left pleural space and sent for bacterial culture which revealed mixed infection with Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas.
Abdominal ultrasound showed hypoechoic tube-like structure from the lower pole of the spleen to the left pleural space.
Barium enema showed narrowed colon with lacunar defects and extensive fistulous tracks at the splenic flexure with two of them spreading towards the left diaphragm. Later serial shots clearly revealed that barium enema reaches the left pleural space (Fig. ).
Consultant colorectal surgeon was requested and he transferred the patient to the colorectal department. Following resuscitation and short preoperative preparation the patient was operated. After midline laparotomy and thorough exam of abdominal cavity, a rigid mass, 15 cm in diameter was found adherent to the colon, tail of the pancreas, spleen and a part of the left diaphragm. Other parts of the colon were also altered with obvious signs of acute inflammation including cecum and ascending colon. Terminal ileum and colon were dilated up to the level of the splenic flexure which was involved into the inflammatory mass. The rest of the colon below splenic flexyre was not dilated but was also macroscopically altered, appearing as Crohn's colitis. Rectum was affected too, but inflammation was not so severe as in other parts of the colon. After mobilization of splenic flexure, two fistulous tracts with granulation tissue were encountered. One was arising from the splenic flexure of colon and was directed towards the retroperitoneal space beyond the left kidney. The second fistulous tract was directed upwards, between the colon, tail of the pancreas and spleen towards the left diaphragm. After splenectomy and curettage of the fistulous tract, an opening measuring 1 cm in diameter was found in the left diaphragm connected to the pleural cavity. Total colectomy with terminal Brooke ileostomy was performed as one as splenectomy, suture of the left diaphragm and chest tube drainage of the left pleural space. Rectum was transected at the level of promontory and sutured in two layers with interrupted absorbable sutures.
At fourth postoperative day digestive functions recovered, abdominal drains were removed and patient was referred to the Institute for Lung Diseases for further treatment. Pathological exam of the resected specimen revealed severe form of Crohn's colitis with transmural inflammation and thickening of the bowel wall. Inflammatory changes were most prominent in the region of the fistulous opening where the wall of colon was thickened with narrowed lumen and strictures (figure ) Right colon also harbored the signs of inflammation but was relatively spared compared to the transverse and left colon.
The patient was discharged from hospital on 32nd postoperative day in good condition with normal chest radiography. No further specific therapy addressed to Crohn's disease was warranted. At the last outpatient visit one year ago, she was doing well without any medicatons and improved BMI (25.3).","[[27.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['Lung', 'lower extremities', 'Respiratory', 'abdomen', 'left hypochondrial quadrant', 'Abdominal', 'anal canal to the level of transverse colon', 'lumen', 'Chest', 'chest', 'left pleural space', 'left pleural space', 'Abdominal', 'lower pole of the spleen', 'left pleural space', 'colon', 'splenic flexure', 'left diaphragm', 'left pleural', 'left pleural space', 'abdominal cavity', 'colon', 'tail of the pancreas', 'spleen', 'part of the left diaphragm', 'colon', 'cecum', 'ascending colon', 'Terminal ileum', 'splenic flexure', 'rest of the colon below splenic flexyre', 'colon', 'Rectum', 'other parts of the colon', 'splenic flexure', 'granulation tissue', 'splenic flexure of colon', 'retroperitoneal space beyond the left kidney', 'second fistulous tract', 'colon', 'tail of the pancreas', 'spleen', 'left diaphragm', 'fistulous tract', 'left diaphragm', 'pleural cavity', 'left diaphragm', 'chest', 'left pleural space', 'Rectum', 'level of promontory', 'digestive', 'abdominal', 'Lung', 'transmural', 'bowel wall', 'region of the fistulous opening', 'wall of colon', 'lumen', 'Right colon', 'transverse and left colon', 'chest']","['Lung Diseases', 'general condition was poor', 'ill', 'febrile', 'dyspnoic', 'exhausted', 'cough', 'hypoproteine pitting edema of lower extremities', 'Respiratory sounds were diminished', 'rigidity', 'guarding', 'Abdominal sounds were diminished', ""Crohn's colitis"", 'attacks', ""Crohn's colitis"", 'serpiginous ulcerations', 'narrowed lumen', 'hydropneumothorax', 'feculent effusion', 'feculent smelling fluid', 'mixed infection', 'Staphylococcus', 'Enterococcus', 'Klebsiella', 'Escherichia coli', 'Pseudomonas', 'hypoechoic tube-like structure', 'narrowed colon', 'lacunar defects', 'fistulous tracks', 'barium enema', 'rigid mass', 'mass', 'altered', 'inflammation', 'inflammatory mass', 'dilated', 'macroscopically altered', ""Crohn's colitis"", 'affected', 'inflammation', 'mobilization of splenic flexure', 'fistulous tracts', 'second fistulous tract was directed upwards', 'spleen towards the left diaphragm', 'opening', 'chest tube drainage of the left pleural space', 'digestive functions recovered', 'Lung Diseases', ""Crohn's colitis"", 'transmural inflammation', 'thickening of the bowel wall', 'Inflammatory changes', 'fistulous opening', 'thickened', 'narrowed lumen', 'strictures', 'inflammation', 'good condition', ""Crohn's disease""]","['Budesonid', 'Salofalk', 'Salofalk']","['27', 'December 2002', '1999', 'Institute', '32nd']","['Body Mass Index', 'Physical exam of the abdomen', 'Laboratory', 'Hemoglobin', 'Leukocytes', 'Platelets', 'Albumin', 'therapy', 'medical treatment', 'operation', 'Colonoscopy', 'Chest radiography', 'Thoracocentesis', 'chest tube insertion in the left pleural space', 'Total of 3500 ml of feculent smelling fluid was drained out of the left pleural space', 'bacterial culture', 'Abdominal ultrasound', 'Barium enema', 'serial shots', 'resuscitation', 'midline laparotomy', 'exam of abdominal cavity', 'Terminal ileum and colon were dilated up to the level of the splenic flexure', 'splenectomy', 'curettage of the fistulous tract', 'Total colectomy', 'terminal Brooke ileostomy', 'splenectomy', 'suture of the left diaphragm', 'chest tube drainage of the left pleural space', 'Rectum was transected at the level of promontory and sutured in two layers with interrupted absorbable sutures', 'abdominal drains were removed', 'treatment', 'Pathological exam', 'resected specimen', 'chest radiography', 'specific therapy', 'therapy', 'medicatons', 'BMI']","['since 1999', 'one year prior the operation', '32nd postoperative day', 'postoperative day']"

In July 2003, a second relapse of leukemia was established and the patient achieved complete hematologic remission following induction chemotherapy. He then received consolidation chemotherapy. In neutropenic period, he developed first neutropenic fever that resolved with broad spectrum antibiotics. But, fever recurred and he developed signs of respiratory failure with tachypnea. Chest X-ray showed pulmonary infiltration in the left lower lobe. Intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics were started, and on day 3 of the beginning of respiratory symptoms, intravenous L-AmB (1 mg/kg/day) was added as an antifungal therapy. Aspergillus was not cultured from his sputum, and galactomannan antigen (GM), (Platelia® Aspergillus; Bio-Rad Laboratories, France) and blood culture were negative. Testing for Aspergillus antigenemia presented positivity and L-AmB dose was increased to 3 mg/kg/day, on day 6. At that time, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed the presence of pulmonary infiltrates in the left and right superior lobes and a cavity in the left lower lobe (Figure ). Thereafter, his respiratory condition improved and fever resolved within three days, and he recovered from neutropenia without use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor a week later. On day 11, a chest X-ray demonstrated reduction of pulmonary infiltrates, however the cavitary lesion persisted. After informed consent of the patient was obtained he underwent surgical treatment under general anesthesia on day 20. There was no adhesion in the thoracic cavity. The lesion was easily identified and pulmonary wedge resection was performed (Figure ). The operative course was uneventful and blood loss was minor. Aspergillus flavus was cultured and many Aspergillus hyphae were demonstrated within the surgical specimen. In January 2004, a third relapse of leukemia was established. He again underwent induction and further chemotherapies, and then, in February 2005, he received allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. These procedures were established without IPA reactivation and he had no side effect thought to be secondary to pulmonary resection.

Histological examination of the tumour revealed a 4 cm invasive lobular carcinoma of histological grade 2. Two of the 20 lymph nodes examined were infiltrated by tumour cells. Immunohistochemistry for oestrogen and progesterone receptors showed weak staining of 20% of cancer cells for both receptors. There was no evidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. The patient received six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2, 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, every 21 days) and was on tamoxifen. Ten years later a local recurrence occurred, and the patient underwent partial resection of the thorax wall followed by reconstruction by transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneus (TRAM) flap technique. No adjuvant treatment was given. The patient came to our attention complaining of a 4-month history of diffuse abdominal pain associated to constipation, tenesmus and sporadic rectal bleeding. On physical examination, the patient was pale but moderately nourished. The mastectomy bed, the controlateral breast, and both axilla were normal. Abdominal examination showed no palpable mass or ascites. At digital examination the rectum appeared stenotic from about 6 cm above the anal verge, but without evidence of endoluminal masses. Haematological analysis and biochemical parameters including liver and renal function tests were within the normal range. The urine cytology revealed micro-hematuria. The patient was submitted to a rectosigmoidoscopy which showed a diffuse thickening of the anterior wall of the rectum, which determined mild stenosis beginning 7 cm above the anal verge, without evidence of endoluminal masses. The mucosa which lined the anterior rectal wall was hyperaemic and easily bleeding. The posterior wall of the vagina showed diffuse thickening at vaginal endoscopy. The histological examination of multiple biopsies taken during rectosigmoidoscopy, revealed an extensive infiltration by scarcely cohesive neoplastic cells with ""Indian file"" features and focal targettoid arrangement around rectal glands (Fig , ). The vaginal biopsy confirmed a prevalent ""Indian file"" neoplastic growth pattern (Fig. ). In both biopsies malignant cells were small, with atypical nuclei and vacuolated cytoplasm, often with ""signet ring"" morphology. The rectal glands and the vaginal epithelium showed no atypias A panel of selected immunohistochemical markers was used to confirm the metastatic nature of the neoplastic mass and its site of origin. Immunohistochemical stainings for oestrogen and progesterone receptors (Fig ), GFCDP-15, C-ERB-B2 and CK 7 were positive. Otherwise, they resulted negative for CK 20, WT-1, CA-125 and CDX-2. This immunohistochemical pattern, together with the typical morphological picture showed above, let us confirm the diagnosis of metastatic location from ILC.
A computerised tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed how the pelvic cavity was almost completely occupied by neoplastic tissue which infiltrated the rectal wall, causing marked stenosis, both the ovaries, the fundus of the vagina and the left lateral wall of the bladder, with involvement of the left ureter and concurrent hydronephrosis. Multiple enlarged lymph-nodes were identified in the perirectal fat, along the common iliac artery and the obturator chain and in the inter-aortocaval space. The liver and the chest appeared normal. Mammographic and ultrasonographic picture of the left breast and of both axilla were normal. On the basis of the diagnosis of wide peritoneal and extraperitoneal metastatic spread of ILC, the patient entered a protocol of systemic chemotherapy and hormonal therapy after the placement of a J ureteral stent to pass through the stenosis evidenced by the CT scan and confirmed by cystoscopy.","[[67.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['radical', 'axillary lymph node', 'breast', 'lobular', 'lymph nodes', 'thorax wall', 'transverse rectus', 'transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneus', 'TRAM', 'abdominal', 'rectal', 'mastectomy bed', 'controlateral breast', 'both axilla', 'Abdominal', 'rectum', '6 cm above the anal', '6 cm above the anal verge', 'endoluminal', 'liver', 'renal', 'anterior wall of the rectum', '7 cm above the anal verge', 'endoluminal', 'mucosa which lined the anterior rectal wall', 'anterior rectal wall', 'posterior wall of the vagina', 'vaginal', 'rectal glands', 'vaginal', 'rectal glands', 'vaginal epithelium', 'site of origin', 'abdomen', 'pelvis', 'pelvic cavity', 'neoplastic tissue', 'rectal wall', 'both the ovaries', 'fundus', 'fundus of the vagina', 'left lateral wall of the bladder', 'left ureter', 'lymph-nodes', 'perirectal', 'perirectal fat', 'common iliac artery', 'obturator chain', 'inter-aortocaval space', 'liver', 'chest', 'left breast', 'both axilla', 'peritoneal', 'extraperitoneal', 'ureteral']","['carcinoma of the breast', 'lobular carcinoma', 'infiltrated by tumour cells', 'tumour', 'cancer cells for both receptors', 'distant metastases', 'local recurrence', 'abdominal pain', 'constipation', 'tenesmus', 'rectal bleeding', 'pale', 'nourished', 'mass', 'ascites', 'stenotic', 'endoluminal masses', 'micro-hematuria', 'thickening of the anterior wall of the rectum', 'stenosis', 'endoluminal masses', 'hyperaemic', 'easily bleeding', 'bleeding', 'thickening', 'infiltration', 'cohesive neoplastic cells', 'Indian file"" features', 'focal targettoid arrangement', 'focal targettoid arrangement around rectal glands', 'Indian file"" neoplastic growth pattern', 'malignant cells', 'atypical nuclei', 'vacuolated cytoplasm', 'signet ring"" morphology', 'atypias', 'neoplastic mass', 'typical morphological picture', 'metastatic location', 'ILC', 'occupied by neoplastic tissue', 'infiltrated', 'stenosis', 'involvement of the left ureter', 'hydronephrosis', 'enlarged lymph-nodes', 'perirectal fat', 'appeared normal', 'metastatic spread of ILC', 'stenosis']","['cyclophosphamide', 'mitoxantrone', '5-fluorouracil', 'tamoxifen']","['67', 'Indian']","['right modified radical mastectomy', 'axillary lymph node dissection', 'Histological examination of the tumour', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunohistochemistry for oestrogen and progesterone receptors', 'oestrogen', 'adjuvant chemotherapy', 'partial resection of the thorax wall', 'reconstruction by transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneus (TRAM) flap technique', 'adjuvant treatment', 'physical examination', 'digital examination', 'Haematological analysis', 'biochemical parameters', 'liver and renal function tests', 'urine cytology', 'rectosigmoidoscopy', 'vaginal endoscopy', 'histological examination', 'biopsies', 'rectosigmoidoscopy', 'vaginal biopsy', 'biopsies', 'panel of selected immunohistochemical markers', 'Immunohistochemical stainings', 'oestrogen and progesterone receptors', 'GFCDP-15', 'C-ERB-B2', 'CK 7', 'CK 20', 'WT', 'CA', 'CDX', 'immunohistochemical pattern', 'computerised tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis', 'Mammographic and ultrasonographic picture of the left breast', 'systemic chemotherapy', 'hormonal therapy', 'placement of a J ureteral stent to pass through the stenosis', 'CT scan', 'cystoscopy']","['15 years ago', 'Ten years later', '4-month']"

This estimate of the amount ingested was based on empty ibuprofen packets found near her. The patient was bought into the Emergency Department having been found collapsed and unconscious at home by her family, who had last seen her well approximately five hours previously. There was no history of vomiting, gastrointestinal haemorrhage or seizures prior to presentation at hospital. Her initial Glasgow Coma Scale was 3/15 and the patient was therefore intubated and ventilated to provide a protected airway. On presentation she was haemodynamically compromised with a systolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg. The patient's initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, normal QRS duration and normal QT duration, but widespread myocardial ischaemia was noted. Initial biochemistry blood test results were sodium 132 mmol/l, potassium 4.7 mmol/l, urea 4.8 mmol/l, creatinine 159 μmol/l and venous blood glucose 4.7 mmol/l. Paracetamol and salicylate concentrations were not detected on her admission blood samples. Arterial blood gases showed a severe metabolic acidosis with pH 6.99, base excess of -21 and lactate of 17 mmol/l. The patient was commenced on epinephrine and norepinephrine for inotropic support in view of the significant hypotension, and the Guy's and St Thomas' Poisons Unit was contacted for further advice on management.
Since this was potentially a life-threatening ingestion of a sustained-release preparation of ibuprofen, it was recommended that multidose activated charcoal (50 g activated charcoal every 3–4 hours) should be given via a nasogastric tube to try and reduce further absorption of ibuprofen from the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's severe metabolic acidosis should be corrected with repeated doses of intravenous boluses of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, and haemofiltration with a bicarbonate buffer if the metabolic acidosis did not respond to intravenous sodium bicarbonate. Other potential common drug and toxicological causes of a high anion gap lactic acidosis are summarised in Table . It should be ensured that the patient is adequately filled with intravenous fluid to sustain blood pressure prior to the commencement of any additional inotropic support.
Despite fluid resuscitation and maximal infusion doses of epinephrine and norepinephrine, the patient remained hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg. Additionally her metabolic acidosis remained resistant to intravenous sodium bicarbonate and haemofiltration with a bicarbonate buffer, with only minor improvement to pH 7.00.

460,1550933-1,16740173,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1550933.xml,Case report: Acute unintentional carbachol intoxication,"The son of an 84-year-old male discovered a media report in Germany's most popular daily newspaper stating clinical success with plant extracts (Salvia lavandulaefolia (Spanish sage) and Melissa officinalis (lemon balm), among others) in Alzheimer's disease. According to this report, the mode of action of these extracts are said to be comparable to the synthetic compound 'carbamylcholin'; that is, carbachol.
Approaching a pharmacy for a medicine containing this drug, he was informed that all such brand products were prescription-only. However, he was told that this holds true only for the registered medicines but not for the substance. Eventually, he ordered and bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance. Eleven days later, the patient was administered a teaspoon equivalent to 400 to 500 mg of carbachol (the average parenteral therapeutic dose is 1 mg). Minutes later, he developed nausea, sweating and hypotension, and finally collapsed. The emergency physician observed bradycardia and cholinergic symptoms. Some minutes later asystole occurred. The physician initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, immediately injecting 3 × 1 mg of adrenaline (epinephrine), 2 × 0.5 mg of atropine and 80 mg of furosemide (at that time, cholinergic/carbachol intoxication was not diagnosed; the rationale for administering furosemide was suspicion of left ventricular failure). He was intubated and ventilated, and cardiac output returned.
On hospital admission, 0.5 mg of atropine was injected intravenously and 60 g of activated charcoal as well as 60 ml of lactulose were administered through a nasogastric tube (although diarrhoea might be expected after cholinergic poisoning, a laxative was administered to avoid constipation and hence prolonged absorption of carbachol as a result of atropine therapy). On the intensive care unit, the blood pressure of the bradyarrhythmic patient was 100/65 mmHg and the heart rate was 60 beats/minute. Further signs were hyperhidrosis, hypersalivation, bronchorrhoea, and severe miosis; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio-ventricular dissociation. The remaining physical examination was unremarkable.
On the first day, a total of 50 mg atropine (2 mg/hour) and a perfusion of adrenaline and dopamine were necessary.
Significant laboratory test results were as follows: leukocyte count (WBC) 14.4 × 109/l (peaking at 22.0 × 109/l), platelet count 250 × 109/l, haemoglobin 12.5 g/dl (trough at 11.0 g/dl), serum creatinine 221 μmol/l (peaking at 292 μmol/l), urea 33.3 mmol/l, total protein 55 g/l, C-reactive protein 35 mg/l (peaking at 208 mg/l), and blood glucose 12.5 mmol/l.
Chest X-ray on admission and during the first part of the treatment showed no signs of inhalation pneumonia.
After administration of decreasing doses of atropine, adrenaline and dopamine, the patient was extubated 1 week later. However, increasing dyspnea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation. A bronchopulmonary infection, identified in the tracheal secretion as Proteus mirabilis, was treated with ampicillin/sulbactam, severe bronchoconstriction with salbutamol, theophylline, and high doses of prednisolone.
One week later, the patient was again extubated and three days later transferred to a peripheral ward. On the next day he died. As the respiratory situation was considerably improved and sepsis signs were not observed, death was most probably related to heart failure.
Known diseases were Alzheimer's disease, heart failure and diabetes type 2.
Ambulatory care medication was piracetam, furosemide, captopril, metformin and glyburide.

Chest radiography demonstrated a mass in the right chest and a subsequent CT scan revealed a large anterior mediastinal mass extending mostly into the right hemithorax and compressing the right lung. The radiological appearances were consistent with a teratoma (Fig. ). The CT scan also revealed abdominal lymphadenopathy, which on biopsy proved to be non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The lymphoma was successfully treated with chemotherapy, without any change in the lung mass. Nevertheless, surgical excision of this mass was indicated due to its large size.
The patient underwent a median sternotomy whereupon a giant fatty tumour was found arising superficially from the medial border of the right lung occupying most of the right chest and extending to the anterior mediastinum. The mass was compressing the right lung with no evidence of local invasion. The right phrenic nerve was identified and preserved, and the tumour was found to be adherent to the medial border of the lung and was easily dissected with sharp dissection and removed en bloc. The postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on the seventh postoperative day. Six months postoperatively the patient remains well. The final histology of the tumour, measuring 25.5 × 17.5 × 6.5 cm, and weighing 1134 g (Fig. ), was a pulmonary hamartoma with predominantly adipose and leiomyomatous differentiation.","[[61.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['Chest', 'right chest', 'anterior mediastinal', 'right hemithorax', 'right lung', 'abdominal', 'lung', 'medial border of the right lung', 'right chest', 'anterior mediastinum', 'right lung', 'right phrenic nerve', 'medial border of the lung', 'pulmonary', 'adipose']","['breathlessness', 'mass', 'anterior mediastinal mass', 'compressing the right lung', 'teratoma', 'abdominal lymphadenopathy', ""non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", 'lymphoma', 'change in the lung mass', 'mass', 'fatty tumour', 'tumour', 'mass', 'local invasion', 'preserved', 'tumour', 'recovery was uneventful', 'remains well', 'tumour', 'pulmonary hamartoma', 'leiomyomatous differentiation']",[],['61'],"['Chest radiography', 'CT scan', 'CT scan', 'biopsy', 'chemotherapy', 'surgical excision of this mass', 'median sternotomy', 'dissected', 'dissected with sharp dissection', 'removed en bloc', 'histology', 'weighing']","['postoperative', 'Six months', 'postoperatively']"

He was a manual laborer working from Tamil Nadu, India. He had no history of episodic fever, cough, weight loss, swelling of the left upper extremity or any lumps elsewhere in the body. Clinical examination revealed a mobile and non-tender mass of matted lymph nodes measuring 5 cm × 5 cm with heterogeneous (soft to firm) consistency with some cystic areas, in the central part of the left axilla (Figure ). No other lymph node groups were significantly enlarged. External genitalia were normal. General examination revealed no other abnormalities. A clinical diagnosis of tubercular axillary lymphadenitis was entertained.
A chest x-ray was unremarkable. There was no evidence of leucocytosis, eosinophilia or parasites in his venous blood, sampled during the day. Routine and microscopic examination of the urine was within normal limits. Fine needle (21 G) aspiration cytology from the axillary mass revealed a scanty aspirate, smears from which showed features suggestive of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia.
An ultrasound scan of the left axilla in real-time B-mode and M-mode was carried out by an experienced sonologist in the presence of one of the authors (AB) with a Toshiba (Justvision 400) ultrasound machine (Toshiba Medical System Corporation, Togichi, Japan) and a 7.5 MHz linear phased array transducer. The scan revealed a lobulated heterogeneous soft tissue mass of size 5.5 cm × 4.5 cm × 5.0 cm. The mass consisted of solid hypoechoic areas (each 2 cm × 1 cm) with multiple dilated tortuous anechoic channels (suggestive of grossly dilated lymphatics) of varying diameter (7 mm to 10 mm). There was no evidence of calcification or the typical filarial dance sign of Wuchereria bancrofti inside the dilated channels (Figure ). A sonographic diagnosis of the left axillary lymphadenopathy with lymphangiectasia was made. Fine needle aspiration cytology from the dilated lymphatics and the solid areas was then performed and microscopic examination of which revealed multiple microfilariae of Wuchereria bancrofti in a background of reactive lymphoid cells (Figure ). A scrotal ultrasound scan was not done as the external genitalia were normal.
A nocturnal venous blood smear examination (three weeks after presentation) showed eosinophilia but failed to show any microfilaria. The absolute eosinophil count was 2520/mm3. A thick venous blood smear examination taken one hour after the administration of 100 mg oral diethylcarbamazine (in the daytime) (DEC provocation test) revealed numerous typical microfilariae of Wuchereria bancrofti (Figure ). The microfilarial density however, was not determined.
The patient then received oral diethylcarbamazine (100 mg q8 h) for 3 weeks. In October 2004 the size of the axillary mass and diameter of the lymphatic vessels had reduced in size considerably. This was confirmed by a repeat ultrasound examination of the left axilla (performed by the same sonologist using the same ultrasound machine), which revealed a heterogeneous soft tissue mass of 3.0 cm × 3.0 cm × 4.5 cm with dilated tortuous lymphatic channels, diameter less than 5 mm (Figure ). The patient had no other symptoms or signs attributable to filariasis. No scrotal nodules developed during the period of treatment. Repeated microscopic examinations of thick smears of the patient's venous blood taken at night yielded no microfilaria. Membrane filtration concentration technique for detection of microfilaria was not used.","[[21.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['left arm pit', 'left upper extremity', 'body', 'matted lymph nodes', 'central part of the left axilla', 'lymph node groups', 'External genitalia', 'tubercular axillary', 'axillary', 'chest', 'axillary', 'lymphoid', 'left axilla', 'soft tissue', 'anechoic channels', 'lymphatics', 'filarial', 'dilated channels', 'left axillary', 'lymphatics', 'solid areas', 'scrotal', 'external genitalia', 'venous', 'venous', 'axillary', 'lymphatic vessels', 'left axilla', 'soft tissue', 'lymphatic channels', 'scrotal', 'venous']","['lump', 'fever', 'cough', 'weight loss', 'swelling of the left upper extremity', 'lumps', 'mass of matted lymph nodes', 'cystic areas', 'enlarged', 'External genitalia were normal', 'abnormalities', 'tubercular axillary lymphadenitis', 'unremarkable', 'leucocytosis', 'eosinophilia', 'parasites in his venous blood', 'axillary mass', 'scanty aspirate', 'reactive lymphoid hyperplasia', 'soft tissue mass', 'mass', 'dilated tortuous anechoic channels', 'dilated lymphatics', 'calcification', 'filarial dance sign', 'Wuchereria bancrofti', 'left axillary lymphadenopathy', 'lymphangiectasia', 'dilated lymphatics', 'microfilariae of Wuchereria bancrofti', 'reactive lymphoid cells', 'external genitalia were normal', 'eosinophilia', 'microfilaria', 'microfilariae of Wuchereria bancrofti', 'microfilarial density', 'size of the axillary mass', 'diameter of the lymphatic vessels had reduced in size', 'heterogeneous soft tissue mass', 'dilated tortuous lymphatic channels', 'symptoms', 'signs', 'filariasis', 'scrotal nodules', 'microfilaria', 'microfilaria']","['diethylcarbamazine', 'diethylcarbamazine']","['21', 'July 2004', 'manual laborer', 'Tamil Nadu, India', 'Toshiba Medical System Corporation', 'Japan', 'October 2004']","['Clinical examination', 'chest x-ray', 'microscopic examination of the urine', 'Fine needle (21 G) aspiration cytology', 'smears', 'ultrasound scan of the left axilla in real-time B-mode and M-mode', 'scan', 'sonographic', 'Fine needle aspiration cytology', 'microscopic examination', 'scrotal ultrasound scan', 'nocturnal venous blood smear examination', 'absolute eosinophil count', 'thick venous blood smear examination', 'DEC provocation test', 'ultrasound examination of the left axilla', ""microscopic examinations of thick smears of the patient's venous blood""]","['six months', 'three weeks', 'October 2004', 'October 2004', 'at night']"

His past medical history was significant only for alcohol abuse and a history of syphilis. His physical examination revealed a 1 × 1 cm mass on the right lateral aspect of the tongue (Figure ). The mass was felt to be a traumatic lesion secondary to abrasion against a fractured tooth. The fractured tooth was extracted. Six months later, the mass continued to enlarge in size and the patient presented to our institution. Preliminary diagnosis was fibroma and an excisional biopsy was performed. The pathologic specimen measured 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.3 cm in size. Microscopic examination revealed a well-circumscribed tumor composed of varying sized fat cells, fibrous tissue and numerous blood vessels. Numerous lipoblasts were present, and nuclei throughout the tumor were pleomorphic and hyperchromatic. Mitotic figures were present but rare (Figures and ). A diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma was made. The case was presented to Tumor Board at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and the recommendation was for wide local excision of the previously biopsied area. The patient was taken back to the operating room and 1 cm margins of the previously biposied area were obtained with a KTP laser. Histologic inspection revealed no evidence of residual tumor.

Clinical investigation revealed depression, pyrexia (39.9°C), lameness, reluctance to stand and joint pain in multiple joints. Diagnostic procedures included complete blood count (CBC), blood smear analysis, serum biochemistry, urinalysis, cytological evaluation of lymph nodes and synovial fluid and radiographs of joints. The CBC, blood smear and serum biochemistry revealed a regenerative anaemia characterised by increased reticulocyte count, spherocytosis and erythrocyte autoagglutination. Cytology revealed reactive lymphadenopathy in lymph notes and neutrophilic inflammation in all joints sampled, with Anaplasma phagocytophilum-like inclusions in occasional neutrophils. Radiographs revealed no sign of erosive joint-processes with only slight soft tissue changes. A diagnosis of type II Immune-mediated polyarthritis (IMPA) and immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) was established and antibiotic therapy (doxycycline 10 mg/kg sid [Ronaxan; Merial]) was initiated. To further confirm A. phagocytophilum infection and rule out other potential suspect causes of IMHA and type II IMPA, thoracic radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, PCR tests for canine distemper virus, Ehrlichia spp., serum antibody titer-tests for Borrelia spp., Bartonella spp. and Babesia spp. and anti-nuclear antibody test were performed. All were unremarkable. A serum antibody titer for Ehrlichia equi (Anaplasma phagocytophilum []) was, however, positive (IgG titer 1:640 [cut-off; 1:32]). Based on the clinical and paraclinical examinations, the dog was considered to suffer from IMHA and a type II IMPA secondary to an A. phagocytophilum infection.
Immunosuppressive therapy (prednisolone 1.0 mg/kg bid [Prednisolonacetat; Nycomed]) was initiated and antibiotic therapy (doxycycline 10 mg/kg sid) was continued.
In the follow-up period, the dog was monitored by means of clinical examinations and CBC on a weekly to bi-weekly schedule. C-reactive protein were measured by means of a validated human CRP immunoturbidimetric assay [,] in parallel with CBC. The CRP values were not disclosed to the clinicians (blinded). The corticosteroid dosage was attempted titrated to an acceptable clinical outcome regarding symptoms of the IMPA and adverse effects of therapy (Fig. ). The dog had several periods with relapse of clinical symptoms of polyarthritis (Fig. ) mainly in relation to tapering of the corticosteroid therapy. Azathioprine (2.0 mg/kg/day [Imurel; Glaxo Wellcome]) was included in the therapy regimen from day 105 in combination with prednisolone to possibly lower the necessary dose of prednisolone (clinical signs of steroid associated adverse effects [polyuria, polydipsia, panting and Cushingoid appearence] were observed at the dosage needed for sufficient IMPA suppression). For 38 days no clinical signs of IMPA were observed on a combination of prednisolone (0.125-0.5 mg/kg bid) and azathioprine (2.0 mg/kg sid), with acceptable degrees of adverse effects at the lower doses of prednisolone. Symptoms of IMPA returned at day 143. Bone marrow suppression with panleukopenia (WBC<6.5·109/L) (Fig. ) and thrombocytopenia (Thrombocyte count<200·109/L) was observed at day 170, where the azathioprine dosage was halved and later discontinued at day 180. The dog was euthanized at day 189 as the owner declined further therapy. Necropsy was not performed, due to owner's reluctance. The WBC and neutrophil count were abnormally high from initiation of therapy until day 144 and 158, respectively and decreased to leukopenic and neutropenic (<3.2·109/L) levels at day 170. The observed fluctuations of the WBC paralleled the fluctuations of the neutrophil count very closely and the data are therefore not shown. Both parameters did not reflect the clinical signs of disease activity in a manner useful for treatment decisions (see neutrophil count in fig. ).
High CRP concentrations (local reference interval 0–18 mg/L) were observed at day 0–4 (65–66 mg/L) declining to within reference interval during initial high-dose prednisolone treatment (0.5–1.0 mg/kg bid [day 5–30]) (Fig. ). From day 30 to day 90 (with prednisolone dosage consistently below 0.5 mg/kg bid) CRP gradually increased. The CRP was already increased at the first relapses of clinical signs of polyarthritis (day 47–49 and day 61–95) and CRP was persistently high during the periods of clinical signs. An equivalent pattern was observed during the second phase of prednisolone titration with a rapid decline in CRP during high prednisolone dosage and an increase shortly after tapering the dosage, with observation of a high CRP value at the relapse of clinical signs (day 143–160) (Fig. ). The CRP declined to immeasurable values during the period of severe bone marrow suppression, where inflammatory activity was impaired by a depletion of inflammatory cells.
Thus, a marked increase in CRP were observed on two occasions, related to the reappearence of clinical signs of polyarthritis.","[[9.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['joint', 'multiple joints', 'lymph nodes', 'synovial fluid', 'joints', 'all joints', 'joint', 'soft tissue', 'thoracic', 'abdominal', 'Bone marrow', 'bone marrow']","['weight-loss', 'lethargy', 'lameness', 'generalised lymphadenopathy', 'lymphadenopathy', 'febrile episodes', 'depression', 'pyrexia', 'lameness', 'reluctance to stand', 'joint pain', 'regenerative anaemia', 'spherocytosis', 'erythrocyte autoagglutination', 'reactive lymphadenopathy', 'neutrophilic inflammation', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum-like inclusions', 'neutrophils', 'erosive joint-processes', 'soft tissue changes', 'Immune-mediated polyarthritis', 'IMPA', 'immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia', 'IMHA', 'A. phagocytophilum infection', 'IMHA', 'IMPA', 'IMHA', 'IMPA', 'A. phagocytophilum infection', 'symptoms of the IMPA', 'adverse effects of therapy', 'symptoms of polyarthritis', 'polyarthritis', 'steroid associated adverse effects', 'polyuria', 'polydipsia', 'panting', 'Cushingoid appearence', 'IMPA suppression', 'IMPA', 'adverse effects', 'IMPA', 'Bone marrow suppression', 'panleukopenia', 'thrombocytopenia', 'disease activity', 'polyarthritis', 'bone marrow suppression', 'inflammatory activity', 'depletion of inflammatory cells', 'polyarthritis']","['doxycycline', 'Ronaxan', 'prednisolone', 'Prednisolonacetat', 'Nycomed', 'doxycycline', 'Azathioprine', 'Imurel', 'prednisolone', 'prednisolone', 'prednisolone', 'azathioprine', 'prednisolone', 'azathioprine', 'prednisolone', 'prednisolone', 'prednisolone']","['9-year', 'Springer Spaniel', 'Small Animal Veterinary', 'Royal Veterinary', 'Agricultural University, Denmark', 'IMHA', '200·109', '2·109']","['antibiotic', 'anti-inflammatory steroid', 'anti-inflammatory steroid treatment', 'complete blood count', 'CBC', 'blood smear analysis', 'serum biochemistry', 'urinalysis', 'cytological evaluation of lymph nodes and synovial fluid', 'radiographs of joints', 'CBC', 'blood smear', 'serum biochemistry', 'reticulocyte count', 'Cytology', 'Radiographs', 'antibiotic therapy', 'thoracic radiographs', 'abdominal ultrasound', 'PCR tests for canine distemper virus', 'Ehrlichia spp.', 'serum antibody titer-tests for Borrelia spp.', 'Bartonella spp.', 'Babesia spp.', 'anti-nuclear antibody test', 'serum antibody titer', 'Ehrlichia equi', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'IgG titer', 'clinical and paraclinical examinations', 'Immunosuppressive therapy', 'antibiotic therapy', 'CBC', 'C-reactive protein', 'human CRP immunoturbidimetric assay', 'CBC', 'CRP', 'corticosteroid', 'corticosteroid therapy', 'therapy regimen', 'IMPA suppression', 'WBC', 'Thrombocyte count', 'euthanized', 'therapy', 'Necropsy', 'WBC', 'neutrophil count', 'therapy', 'leukopenic', 'neutropenic', 'WBC', 'neutrophil count', 'neutrophil count', 'CRP concentrations', 'prednisolone treatment', 'CRP', 'CRP', 'CRP', 'CRP', 'CRP', 'CRP', 'CRP']","['8 weeks', 'day 105', '38 days', 'day 143']"

He was initially found wandering our hospital lobby at night somewhat bewildered and lethargic. Left in the front drive of the hospital by a taxi cab, the patient said that he had a ""seizure attack."" He was carrying multiple bags as if he were on a trip. Shortly after being taken to the Emergency Department (ED), Mr. R became agitated, at which time he received intramuscular haloperidol and lorazepam, and intravenous phenytoin. The patient slept and an EEG was performed.
Information was gathered by telephone contact with the patient's family, and we determined that Mr. R was married and lived in a different city where he was stably employed. The patient had a 4 year history of generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures, perhaps secondarily generalized, and thought to be related to a motor vehicle accident with head trauma and loss of consciousness 11 years prior. He also had a history of febrile convulsions as a child, but there was no known history of CNS infection or developmental delay. There was no family history of seizures.
According to the patient's wife, Mr. R had a cluster of four witnessed convulsive seizures four days prior to presentation. Behaviour noted prior to convulsions included ""staring, not answering, chewing, swallowing heavily, moving both hands in a swimming motion or picking at things."" Following the four witnessed seizures, three days prior to presentation in our hospital, the patient was brought to his local hospital by his wife where he was admitted. Valproic acid was added to the patient's anti-epileptic regimen of oxcarbazepine. He had an approximately 24 hour period of normal behaviour and was discharged. Two days prior to presentation at our hospital, Mr. R had one sleepless night. His wife described the patient's behaviour as ""hyper"" and ""strange"". He then left his home unannounced, taking belongings with him. In the 24 hours prior to presenting at our hospital, Mr. R made numerous telephone calls to family and friends around the country, making it evident that he was traveling. His reported statements contained delusions of grandeur and wealth, and reflected impulsivity and poor judgments. This behaviour represented a drastic departure from the Mr. R's baseline according to his wife.
Other than the seizure disorder as stated above, past medical history was non-contributory. He had no prior psychiatric history. Substance and alcohol use were not significant. There was a notable family history of depression without suicidality. There were no known environmental exposures. Mr. R was raised as a Christian, but he did not participate in religious activities as an adult.
In the ED, the patient's vital signs, physical exam, cranial nerve, motor and sensory examinations were all within normal limits. On mental status examination after 12 hours in hospital, Mr. R was in his undergarments and a hospital gown, sitting without an appropriate sense of modesty. He was reading a copy of the Old Testament. He was friendly, co-operative and jovial. His speech was somewhat rapid but interruptible. He reported his mood as ""really good. Everyone thinks something is wrong when you're really happy."" His affect was bright and at times even euphoric. His thought process was tangential with loose associations, disorganized and at times difficult to follow. His thought content was notable for delusions of grandeur and wealth with religious content, but not of a bizarre nature. Hallucinations were denied and not suspected by behaviour on exam. Mr. R described a sense that he knew the examining clinician, stating ""Are you sure I haven't met you before?"" His language was fluent with normal naming and repetition. Cognitive exam was notable for difficulty with tasks of attention. Review of physical symptoms was notable for denial of macropsia or micropsia, gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, or stomach upset at the time of exam or at any time in the course of his recent illness by report.
Laboratory values revealed normal basic chemistries including liver function tests, coagulation tests, and CBC. Urine and extended serum toxicology tests were negative. Valproic acid level was 21 micrograms/milliliters. Serum creatine kinase levels rose to 1830 U/L at 16 hours after presentation then fell towards normal, with normal troponin levels. Serum prolactin levels were elevated to 20.4 ng/mL at 9 hours after presentation. Ammonia, vitamin B12, serum folate, and thryroid measures were normal, and RPR was non-reactive. ESR, ANA, and rheumatoid factor were within normal limits. Hepatitis C and B and HIV serology were negative. Chest x-ray was normal. A lumbar puncture was not performed.
Brain CT was within normal limits except for mildly prominent ventricles. MRI of brain was notable for encephalomalacic change within bilateral posterior frontal and right parietal lobes, best seen on FLAIR sequences. No abnormal contrast enhancing or mass lesions were noted in the mesial temporal lobes. Multiple hyperintense foci in deep and subcortical white matter were noted on FLAIR bilaterally. Ventricles, sulci and cisterns were mildly prominent for age and there was mild cerebral cortical volume loss.
An electroencephalogram was obtained in the ED on presentation shortly after receiving phenytoin, lorazepam and haloperidol. Diffuse low amplitude slowing with frontocentral predominance was observed, in addition to central and symmetric spindles. No spikes or sharp waves were seen.
Mr. R was admitted to inpatient psychiatry and treated with antiepileptic and antipsychotic medicine. Oxcarbazepine was administered at a dose of 600 mg twice daily, as was valproic acid at a dose of 500 mg three times daily and 750 mg at night. Lorazepam was administered at 1 mg three times daily for 3 days, then tapered. Olanzapine was used at a final dose of 15 mg daily. Disorganized form of thought, delusional content, poor self care and inappropriately bright affect remained until hospital day 8 but began to improve at this time. A repeat EEG was performed on hospital day 5. Both drowsy and asleep EEGs were without definitive evidence of epileptiform activity. Brief periods of awake state showed an unsustained but symmetric 8–10 Hz posterior rhythm. The patient was discharged on hospital day twelve with significant improvement in his mental status.","[[47.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['head', 'CNS', 'both hands', 'cranial nerve', 'mental status', 'Cognitive', 'stomach', 'liver', 'Chest', 'lumbar', 'Brain', 'ventricles', 'brain', 'bilateral posterior frontal and right parietal lobes', 'mesial temporal lobes', 'deep and subcortical white matter', 'subcortical white matter', 'Ventricles', 'sulci', 'cisterns', 'cerebral cortical', 'mental status']","['confused', 'delusions of grandeur', 'elevated mood', 'bewildered', 'lethargic', 'seizure attack', 'agitated', 'slept', 'generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures', 'motor vehicle accident', 'head trauma', 'loss of consciousness', 'febrile convulsions', 'CNS infection', 'developmental delay', 'seizures', 'convulsive seizures', 'Behaviour', 'convulsions', 'staring', 'not answering', 'chewing', 'swallowing heavily', 'moving both hands in a swimming motion', 'picking at things', 'seizures', 'normal behaviour', 'sleepless night', 'behaviour as ""hyper"" and ""strange""', 'hyper', 'strange', 'delusions of grandeur and wealth', 'impulsivity', 'poor judgments', 'seizure disorder', 'Substance and alcohol use', 'depression', 'suicidality', 'environmental exposures', 'sitting without an appropriate sense of modesty', 'reading a copy of the Old Testament', 'friendly', 'co-operative', 'jovial', 'speech was somewhat rapid', 'speech was somewhat rapid but interruptible', 'interruptible', 'mood as ""really good', 'affect was bright', 'euphoric', 'thought process was tangential', 'loose associations', 'disorganized', 'at times difficult to follow', 'difficult to follow', 'thought content was notable for delusions of grandeur and wealth with religious content', 'bizarre nature', 'Hallucinations', 'Hallucinations were denied', 'behaviour', 'language was fluent', 'normal naming and repetition', 'difficulty with tasks of attention', 'physical symptoms', 'macropsia', 'micropsia', 'gustatory or olfactory hallucinations', 'stomach upset', 'normal basic chemistries', 'normal troponin levels', 'within normal limits', 'prominent ventricles', 'encephalomalacic change', 'abnormal contrast enhancing', 'mass lesions', 'hyperintense foci', 'prominent for age', 'cerebral cortical volume loss', 'low amplitude slowing', 'frontocentral predominance', 'central and symmetric spindles', 'spikes', 'sharp waves', 'Disorganized form of thought', 'delusional content', 'poor self care', 'inappropriately bright affect', 'drowsy', 'asleep', 'epileptiform', 'epileptiform activity', 'awake state', '8–10 Hz posterior rhythm', 'improvement in his mental status']","['haloperidol', 'lorazepam', 'phenytoin', 'Valproic acid', 'oxcarbazepine', 'phenytoin', 'lorazepam', 'haloperidol', 'Oxcarbazepine', 'valproic acid', 'Lorazepam', 'Olanzapine']","['R', '47', 'Emergency Department', 'ED', 'R', 'R', '4', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'Christian', 'ED', 'R', 'R', 'ED', 'R', 'inpatient psychiatry']","['EEG', 'anti-epileptic regimen', 'vital signs', 'physical exam', 'motor and sensory examinations', 'mental status examination', 'Laboratory', 'basic chemistries', 'liver function tests', 'coagulation tests', 'CBC', 'Urine and extended serum toxicology tests', 'Valproic acid level', 'Serum creatine kinase levels', 'troponin levels', 'Serum prolactin levels', 'Ammonia', 'vitamin B12', 'serum folate', 'thryroid measures', 'RPR', 'ESR', 'ANA', 'rheumatoid factor', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C and B', 'HIV serology', 'Chest x-ray', 'lumbar puncture', 'Brain CT', 'MRI of brain', 'electroencephalogram', 'antiepileptic and antipsychotic medicine', 'EEG', 'EEGs']","['at night', 'at night', '4 year', '11 years prior', '11 years prior', 'four days', 'prior to presentation', 'three days prior to presentation', 'approximately 24 hour', 'Two days prior to presentation', 'until hospital day 8', 'until hospital day 8', 'until hospital day 8', 'until hospital day 8', 'at this time', 'at this time', 'at this time', 'at this time', 'on hospital day 5']"
466,1555578-1,16872521,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1555578.xml,Subcutaneous rupture of the Achilles tendon and ipsilateral fracture of the medial malleolus,"A 38 year old male tree surgeon fell six meters from a tree. He was wearing reinforced work boots, and, during the fall, he struck one tree branch with the plantar aspect of his right forefoot before landing on the ground and falling on his back. At examination in the local Accident and Emergency Department, he referred pain and tenderness over the posterior aspect of the ankle, and swelling was noted posteromedially. At palpation, there was tenderness four centimetres above the insertion of the Achilles tendon on the calcaneal tuberosity, a two centimetre gap in the Achilles tendon was present, and the calf squeeze test was positive for a subcutaneous Achilles tendon rupture []. Plain radiographs revealed an undisplaced fracture of the medial malleolus (Fig ). Both lesions wee further confirmed by a magnetic resonance scan performed for scientific documentation (Fig ).
The patient initially elected to be managed conservatively, and received an above knee plaster of Paris cast with the foot in maximal equines. He was kept non-weight bearing for one week, and was referred to our unit, where he was seen after two weeks following the original injury. At that time, the above clinical findings were confirmed, and the patient requested to undergo surgery.
At surgery, the patient was placed prone on a fracture table in a bloodless field furnished by a thigh tourniquet. The medial malleolar fracture was visualised under image intensifier: it was undisplaced, and it was decided to manage it conservatively if still undisplaced by the end of the Achilles tendon repair. The tendon was exposed using a slightly curvilinear medial approach. An end-to-end repair was performed using a single modified Kessler suture with No 1 Vicryl (Polyglactin 910 braided absorbable suture, Johnson & Johnson, European Logistics Centre, 66 Rue de la Fusee, B-1130 Bruxelles, Belgium). A running circumferential suture with 3-0 Vicryl reinforced the core suture. The repair was thicker than the original tendon, and the paratenon could not be sutured over it. Continuous 4-0 Vicryl reabsorbable sutures were used for the subcutaneous fat, and the skin was closed with subcuticular 4-0 Vicryl reabsorbable suture. At the end of the procedure, the fracture of the medial malleolus was undisplaced, and it was decided to leave it alone. The skin wound was dressed with gauze, sterile plaster wool was applied, followed by a below knee synthetic cast without increasing the natural minimal equinus of the ankle.
When the cast had dried, the patient was encouraged to mobilise with the use of crutches, under the direction of a physiotherapist. The patient was discharged the day after the operation. He was allowed to bear weight on the tip toes of the operated leg as tolerated, but was told to keep the leg elevated as much as possible for the first two post-operative weeks. Two weeks after the operation, a synthetic anterior below knee slab was applied, with the ankle in the natural minimal equinus. The synthetic slab was secured to the leg with three or four removable Velcro (Velcro USA Inc., Manchester, NH, USA) straps for four weeks. The patient was encouraged to weight bear on the operated limb as soon as he felt comfortable, and to gradually progress to full weight bearing. The patient was seen by a trained physiotherapist who taught him gentle mobilisation exercises of the ankle, isometric contraction of the gastrosoleus complex, and gentle concentric contraction of the calf muscles. The patient was encouraged to perform mobilisation of the involved ankle several times per day after unstrapping the two most distal Velcro straps. The patient was given an appointment six weeks from the operation, when the anterior slab was removed [].
At that time, the fracture site was not painful, the patient was able to fully weight bear and started more intensive physiotherapy. At the 12 month follow up, the patient was asymptomatic with a full range of active and passive ankle motion. The patient was able to walk on tip toes unaided, and had returned to his occupation as a tree surgeon. He reported that, following a full day at work, his ankle at times swelled up, though the swelling had resolved by the following morning. He was discharged from further follow up, and, on telephone questioning two years following the injury, he reported to be leading a normal life.","[[38.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['plantar aspect of his right forefoot', 'back', 'posterior aspect of the ankle', 'four centimetres above the insertion of the Achilles tendon on the calcaneal tuberosity', 'Achilles tendon on the calcaneal tuberosity', 'Achilles tendon', 'calf', 'subcutaneous Achilles tendon', 'medial malleolus', 'knee', 'foot', 'medial malleolar', 'end of the Achilles tendon', 'Achilles tendon', 'tendon', 'original tendon', 'paratenon', 'skin', 'medial malleolus', 'skin', 'below knee', 'ankle', 'tip toes of the operated leg', 'leg', 'leg', 'anterior below knee', 'ankle', 'leg', 'limb', 'gastrosoleus complex', 'calf muscles', 'ankle', 'anterior slab', 'fracture site', 'ankle', 'tip toes', 'ankle']","['fell', 'fall', 'struck one tree branch', 'falling', 'pain', 'tenderness', 'swelling', 'tenderness', 'gap in the Achilles tendon', 'subcutaneous Achilles tendon rupture', 'fracture of the medial malleolus', 'lesions', 'injury', 'medial malleolar fracture', 'undisplaced', 'repair was thicker than the original tendon', 'fracture of the medial malleolus', 'undisplaced', 'skin wound', 'cast had dried', 'ankle in the natural minimal equinus', 'felt comfortable', 'concentric contraction of the calf muscles', 'painful', 'able to fully weight bear', 'asymptomatic', 'full range of active and passive ankle motion', 'able to walk', 'able to walk on tip toes', 'swelled up', 'swelling', 'injury']",[],"['38', 'Emergency Department', 'Johnson & Johnson']","['calf squeeze test', 'Plain radiographs', 'magnetic resonance', 'magnetic resonance scan', 'knee plaster of Paris cast', 'non-weight bearing', 'surgery', 'surgery', 'Achilles tendon repair', 'tendon was exposed using a slightly curvilinear medial approach', 'end-to-end repair was performed using a single modified Kessler suture with No 1 Vicryl', 'running circumferential suture with 3-0 Vicryl reinforced the core suture', 'paratenon could not be sutured over it.', 'Continuous 4-0 Vicryl reabsorbable sutures were used for the subcutaneous fat', 'skin was closed with subcuticular 4-0 Vicryl reabsorbable suture', 'procedure', 'skin wound was dressed with gauze', 'sterile plaster wool was applied', 'below knee synthetic cast', 'encouraged to mobilise', 'encouraged to mobilise with the use of crutches', 'allowed to bear weight on the tip toes of the operated leg', 'keep the leg elevated', 'operation', 'synthetic anterior below knee slab was applied', 'synthetic slab was secured to the leg with three or four removable Velcro (Velcro USA Inc., Manchester, NH, USA) straps', 'weight bear on the operated limb', 'full weight bearing', 'isometric contraction of the gastrosoleus complex', 'gentle concentric contraction of the calf muscles', 'encouraged to perform mobilisation of the involved ankle', 'operation', 'anterior slab was removed', 'intensive physiotherapy']","['two weeks', 'first two post-operative weeks', 'Two weeks', 'Two weeks', 'four weeks', 'six weeks', 'At that time', 'at times', 'by the following morning', 'morning', 'two years']"

Colonoscopy demonstrated a circumferentially developing ulcerated tumor 8 cm above the dentate line, extending 4 cm proximally. The colonoscope was advanced past the tumor, performing a total colonoscopy, while biopsies from the lesion were obtained and examined histologically, revealing a non-keratinized squamous cell carcinoma of the rectum. Abdominal computed tomography and chest radiograph were negative for metastatic disease. However, a transanal endoscopic ultrasound demonstrated the spread of the tumor beyond bowel's wall in the perirectal space, necessitating institution of neoadjuvant therapy. The patient underwent 1 session of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 5-Fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2/d) plus Mitomycin and 5 sessions of radiotherapy (totally 20 Gy). Two days after the last session of radiotherapy a laparotomy was performed. Intraoperative findings included invasion of the posterior vaginal wall from the tumor and an abdominoperineal resection and a concomitant total hysterectomy-oophorectomy were carried out. Histology reported the presence of two ulcerated lesions (1 × 2 cm and 2 × 4 cm) in middle and lower rectum both squamous cell carcinoma of the rectum, invading the bowel wall and the adjacent vaginal wall. The surgical specimen contained 15 lymph nodes, all negative for metastatic disease (T4 N0 M0, stage IIb) and the resected margins were free of tumor. Postoperatively, adjuvant chemotherapy (1 session of 5-FU plus Mitomycin) and 23 sessions of radiotherapy (totally 45 Gy) were administered.
Five months after tumor resection, liver metastasis was demonstrated in a follow-up abdominal computed tomography and a central hepatectomy was performed. Histology confirmed the presence of a metastatic rectal squamous cell carcinoma to the liver (Figure , ). Adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 6 sessions of 5-FU plus Cisplatin (100 mg/m2/d) was applied.

468,1555585-1,16893467,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1555585.xml,Clear cell sarcoma of the scapula. A case report and review of the literature,"A 61-year-old man presented with a painful mass overlying the lower left scapula of four months duration. His pain deteriorated the last three weeks and was accompanied by limitation of the range of motion of the left glenohumeral joint.
Physical examination revealed a subcutaneous tender uniformly firm mass in the lower left scapular region measuring 4.5 × 4.5 cm in diameter. There were no signs of superficial skin inflammation. The patient had not a previous history of melanoma and/or other skin tumors.
Radiological examination showed an osteolytic lesion in the lower left scapula while bone scanning was positive with increased uptake in the same area. CT scans and MRI images of the thorax and shoulder showed a soft tissue mass 45 × 45 mm localized in the lower scapular region between infraspinatus and teres minor muscles with bone invasion of the lower part of the scapula (Figure , , ). There were no lung metastases neither axillary nor mediastinal lymph nodes.
The open biopsy specimen consisted of a rubbery, homogenous, white tissue with no attachment to the skin, implying deep location of the tumor. There were compact nests and fascicles with large rounded and spindle-shaped cells separated by connective tissue septa. The large rounded cells had pleomorphic nuclei and large amounts of clear cytoplasm while the spindle-shaped cells had palely staining eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitoses were moderately numerous. There were areas of necrosis and hemorrhage and tumor spreading into the surrounding muscles and scapula. Immunohistochemical stains were performed with negative staining for CD68, actin and desmin antigens and with positive staining for tumor markers S-100 protein, HMB-45, NSE, EMA, cytokeratins and myosin. Histochemical stains for melanin presence were negative. Pathologic findings were compatible with a CCSTA with osseous extension into the lower scapula (Figure , ).
After three days a wide excision was carried out and the tumor was removed together with the two thirds of the left scapula and the overlying soft tissues. The remaining bone and soft tissue margins were widely free of tumor. Macroscopic and pathologic examination of the removed mass confirmed the primary diagnosis.
Postoperatively the patient started on a chemotherapy protocol (three courses) consisting of ifosfamide, vincristine and epirubicin. The patient had no local recurrences but he developed lung metastases after 5 months. Despite chemotherapy, he died 10 months later with progressive lung disease.","[[61.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['lower left scapula', 'left glenohumeral joint', 'subcutaneous', 'lower left scapular region', 'superficial skin', 'skin', 'lower left scapula', 'bone', 'same area', 'thorax', 'shoulder', 'soft tissue', 'lower scapular region', 'lower scapular region between infraspinatus and teres minor muscles', 'infraspinatus', 'teres minor muscles', 'bone', 'lower part of the scapula', 'lung', 'axillary', 'mediastinal', 'mediastinal lymph nodes', 'white tissue', 'skin', 'connective tissue septa', 'spindle-shaped cells', 'surrounding muscles', 'scapula', 'osseous', 'lower scapula', 'bone', 'soft tissue margins', 'lung', 'lung']","['mass', 'pain', 'limitation of the range of motion of the left glenohumeral joint', 'firm mass', 'mass', 'superficial skin inflammation', 'melanoma', 'skin tumors', 'osteolytic lesion', 'increased uptake', 'soft tissue mass', 'bone invasion of the lower part of the scapula', 'lung metastases', 'lymph nodes', 'open biopsy specimen', 'rubbery', 'homogenous', 'white tissue', 'attachment to the skin', 'deep location of the tumor', 'compact nests', 'fascicles', 'rounded', 'spindle-shaped cells separated by connective tissue septa', 'rounded cells', 'pleomorphic nuclei', 'clear cytoplasm', 'spindle-shaped cells', 'eosinophilic', 'eosinophilic cytoplasm', 'Mitoses', 'necrosis', 'hemorrhage', 'tumor', 'melanin presence', 'CCSTA', 'osseous extension', 'tumor', 'mass', 'local recurrences', 'lung metastases', 'died', 'lung disease']","['ifosfamide', 'vincristine', 'epirubicin']",['61'],"['Physical examination', 'Radiological examination', 'bone scanning', 'CT scans', 'MRI images of the thorax and shoulder', 'Immunohistochemical stains', 'CD68', 'actin', 'desmin antigens', 'staining for tumor markers S-100 protein', 'tumor markers', 'HMB-45', 'NSE', 'EMA', 'cytokeratins', 'myosin', 'Histochemical stains for melanin presence', 'Pathologic', 'wide excision was carried out and the tumor was removed together with the two thirds of the left scapula and the overlying soft tissues', 'Macroscopic', 'Macroscopic and pathologic examination', 'pathologic examination', 'removed mass', 'chemotherapy protocol', 'chemotherapy']","['four months', 'last three weeks', 'After three days', 'Postoperatively', 'after 5 months', '10 months later']"

Routine laboratory study showed hypokalemia (K 3.3 mEq/l). Endocrine studies including T3, T4, TSH, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and renin showed normal. The aldosterone level was elevated to 195 pg/ml (normal range: 30–159 pg/ml). Computed tomography (CT) detected a low density left adrenal mass 16 × 12 mm with small calcification Fig. . Adrenal scintigraphy revealed the uptake of I131-adosterol by the left adrenal gland (Fig. ). Because these diagnostic methods taken together could not rule out primary aldosteronism or malignant tumors, the patient underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The surgical specimen was a 40 × 20 mm adrenal gland tissue containing an 8 mm cystic mass (Fig. ). Histological examination revealed an admixture of adrenal gland and thyroid tissue composed of many follicles lined by a single-layered epithelium. Each follicle contained an eosinophilic colloid-like material (Fig. ). The epithelial cells in the follicles showed immunoreactivity for cytokeratin, thyroglobulin (Fig. ), and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) (Fig. ).
After the surgery, imaging examinations using MRI and I123-scaning thyroid scintigraphy failed to show any lesions in the thyroid. No evidence of other tumors was detected by a whole body CT scan and ultrasound. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and serum TSH, free T3, and free T4 levels were normal.

The swelling was diagnosed as non-obstructive inguinal hernia at the referral centre at 2 months of age. As it was not progressing the parents were advised to wait till the age of one year. There was no history of any trauma to genitalia. On examination the scrotum was swollen on left side and left testis was not palpable separately. The right testis was normally palpable in scrotal sac. Ultrasonographic examination of the swelling showed a markedly enlarged testis with a heterogenous echotexture. A possibility of testicular tumor was suggested and Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)/biopsy were advised. The FNAC showed few clusters of spindle cells and some cells with prominent nucleoli and vacuolated cytoplasm. However no definite opinion was given. A biopsy was also done which was reported as infarction of testis with extensive vascular proliferation. Subsequently a high left inguinal orchidectomy was carried out. Intraoperatively the hernial sac contained clear fluid and no bowel loops were seen. The specimen was sent for histopathology.
The gross examination revealed a tumor replacing the entire testis; however shape of the testicle was maintained (figure ). The tumor measured 4 cm in diameter. Outer surface was smooth and brownish in colour. The cut surface was also reddish brown with areas of hemorrhage. Though the tumor was solid, prominent cystic change and necrosis were seen in the central portion. Microscopic examination showed a vascular tumor composed of anastomosing, irregular vascular channels forming papillae in some areas. These papillae had hyalinized cores and were lined by atypical endothelial cells (figure ). The vascular channels were also lined by plump cuboidal endothelial cells with focal hobnailed appearance and lymphocytic sprinkling. Frequent intracytoplasmic vacuolations and many mitotic figures were identified. The background showed large areas of hemorrhage and infarction.

She had been born with the congenital anomalies of spina bifida and common cloacae. At birth, an artificial anal and urinal plasties had been performed. At the age of 11 her urinary and anal tracts had been surgically separated. After the operation she has been doing well, but at the age of 13, orthopnea and edema of the lower extremities was noticed. She was referred to pediatrics and diagnosed as having congestive heart failure with atrial tachycardia. Digitalis, verapamil, and a small dose of metoprolol were not effective in controlling her arrhythmia, so she was referred to our department for further evaluation and treatment.
Physical examination indicated a small build (body height 112cm, weight 26kg) with underdevelopment of the lower extremities. Chest X-ray revealed marked cardiomegaly with a cardio-thoracic ratio of 77 % (). On echocardiography, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the diastolic dimension were 0.21 and 51 mm, respectively. Her ECG showed atrial tachycardia with a heart rate of 150 beats per minute (bpm) and an upright P wave configuration in the limb leads of II,III, and aVf ().
At first we sought to perform an electrophysiological study, but the venous approach for catheterization was quite difficult since the development of her bilateral femoral vein had been hindered by the operation for her congenital genito-urinal abnormality. Furthermore, the patient and her family were reluctant to accept invasive examination or treatment. Thereafter, we decided to prescribe pilsicainide at an initial dose of 25 mg, and within 2 hours her ectopic atrial tachycardia was converted to a sinus rhythm. It was maintained by a daily dose of 75 mg pilsicainide from that day onward.

He had a history of hypertension, schizophrenia, hypothyroidism and factor XII deficiency. He was not receiving any anticoagulation for his Factor XII deficiency at the time of presentation. According to his emergency department record he was febrile to 38.7 Celsius with mild abdominal distension and tenderness on physical examination. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of his abdomen did not demonstrate any intraabdominal abnormality. An empiric diagnosis of infectious diarrhea with dehydration was made and the patient was discharged back to his facility on Levofloxacin and Metronidazole and intravenous fluids. Three days later, he represented to the emergency department with persistent diarrhea and a metabolic acidosis. A repeat CT scan was obtained which demonstrated an ill-defined rectosigmoid mass, but no obstruction. The pulmonary artery was seen on the uppermost cuts of this scan and there was no evidence of pulmonary embolus at this time (Figure ). Sigmoidoscopy revealed no mass or mucosal abnormality and the patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with continued broad spectrum antibiotics, intravenous hydration and hemodynamic monitoring. He was hemodynamically stable. Sequential compression devices were documented to be in place for DVT/PE prophylaxis.
On hospital day two, the patient developed increasing abdominal tenderness which was associated with fevers up to 39.5 degrees Celsius and acute renal failure. Surgery was consulted and recommended urgent operative exploration. Upon exploration the patient was found to have mesenteric venous thrombosis with a segment of ischemic small bowel. He underwent small bowel resection and was returned to the intensive care unit for continued resuscitation. At this time a heparin infusion was initiated given the patient's known factor XII deficiency and demonstrated mesenteric venous thrombosis. His partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was maintained between 60 and 80 seconds. The following day he had not improved; he was returned to the operating room where a second segment of ischemic bowel was discovered and further resection was performed. The patient again returned to the intensive care unit in critical condition requiring pressor support with levophed and continued ventilatory support with a PaO2 to FiO2 ratio of 180. At this point he was evaluated and found to be a candidate for rhAPC. This was initiated six hours after the completion of his operation. Due to concerns about potential bleeding complications, the heparin infusion was discontinued when the rhAPC was started. At the time of heparin discontinuation the patients PTT was 82 seconds and he had no clinical evidence of DVT or PE. His activated protein C level at that time was less than 10.
Over the course of the following two days, the patient showed significant hemodynamic improvement and pressors were discontinued. By day 3 PaO2 to FiO2 ratio had risen to over 300 and he was requiring minimal ventilatory support. On postoperative day 4, the patient developed acute hypoxia with increasing ventilatory requirements. Spiral computed tomographic scan of his chest with intravenous contrast demonstrated a large saddle pulmonary embolism (Figure ). Heparin infusion was reinstituted and the rhAPC drip was discontinued after 78 hours of the 96 hour course. Doppler studies of the lower extremities and echocardiography revealed no evidence of deep venous or mural thrombus. Subsequently, the patient weaned from the ventilator and was extubated on postoperative day 8. He was transferred to a hospital ward and oral anticoagulation was begun on postoperative day 9. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 13 on oral anticoagulation with an INR or 2.2.","[[48.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['abdominal', 'abdomen', 'intraabdominal', 'rectosigmoid', 'pulmonary artery', 'pulmonary', 'mucosal', 'abdominal', 'renal', 'mesenteric venous', 'small bowel', 'small bowel', 'mesenteric venous', 'bowel', 'chest', 'pulmonary', 'lower extremities', 'deep venous', 'mural']","['diarrhea', 'vomiting', 'decreased mental status', 'hypertension', 'schizophrenia', 'hypothyroidism', 'factor XII deficiency', 'Factor XII deficiency', 'febrile', 'distension', 'tenderness', 'intraabdominal abnormality', 'infectious diarrhea', 'dehydration', 'diarrhea', 'metabolic acidosis', 'rectosigmoid mass', 'obstruction', 'pulmonary embolus', 'mass', 'mucosal abnormality', 'hemodynamically stable', 'Sequential compression devices were documented to be in place', 'abdominal tenderness', 'fevers', 'acute renal failure', 'mesenteric venous thrombosis', 'segment of ischemic small bowel', 'factor XII deficiency', 'mesenteric venous thrombosis', 'not improved', 'second segment of ischemic bowel', 'ischemic bowel', 'critical condition', 'bleeding complications', 'DVT', 'PE.', 'hemodynamic improvement', 'hypoxia', 'saddle pulmonary embolism', 'pulmonary embolism', 'thrombus']","['Levofloxacin', 'Metronidazole', 'fluids', 'heparin', 'levophed', 'heparin', 'heparin', 'Heparin', 'rhAPC']","['48', 'emergency department', 'emergency department', 'emergency department', 'medical intensive care unit', 'intensive care unit', 'operating room', 'intensive care unit']","['anticoagulation', 'physical examination', 'computed tomographic (CT) scan of his abdomen', 'CT scan', 'Sigmoidoscopy', 'broad spectrum antibiotics', 'hydration', 'hemodynamic monitoring', 'DVT/PE prophylaxis', 'small bowel resection', 'resuscitation', 'partial thromboplastin time', 'partial thromboplastin time (PTT)', 'resection', 'pressor support', 'ventilatory support', 'PaO2 to FiO2 ratio', 'rhAPC', 'operation', 'rhAPC', 'PTT', 'activated protein C level', 'pressors', 'PaO2 to FiO2 ratio', 'ventilatory support', 'ventilatory', 'Spiral computed tomographic scan of his chest with intravenous contrast', 'Doppler studies of the lower extremities', 'echocardiography', 'ventilator', 'extubated', 'anticoagulation', 'anticoagulation', 'INR']","['at the time', 'Three days later', 'Three days later', 'at this time', 'hospital day two', 'At this time', 'two days', 'day 3', 'postoperative day 4', 'postoperative day 8', 'postoperative day 9', 'postoperative day 13']"

His American Urinary Association (AUA) symptom score was 24, consistent with severe prostatic symptoms. He had no significant past medical history and was non-diabetic. His general physical examination was normal. On digital rectal examination prostate was enlarged with approximate weight of 50 grams. It was non tender and felt hard and nodular. A provisional diagnosis of locally advanced prostatic carcinoma was made. His renal function tests and complete blood counts were normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 55 mm at 1 hour. Routine urinalysis revealed 8–10 WBC's/hpf but urine culture was negative. PSA was significantly elevated at 150 ng/ml (normal 0–4 ng/ml). At transabdominal ultrasonography he had normal upper renal tract. Bladder was thick walled and prostate was 5 × 5 × 4 Cm in size and was rather uniformly hypoechoic. Post-micturition residual urine was 160 ml. His chest, plain x-ray KUB and radioisotope bone scan was normal. Urine flow rate at flowmetry was 12 ml/sec.
In view of the troublesome obstructive urinary symptoms, significant residual urine, needle biopsies were not performed and he underwent cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). At cystoscopy, prostatic urethra was inflamed. Prostate was quite occlusive with irregular intra-vesical protrusion. Bladder was trabeculated and was generally congested. TURP was carried out, 54 gm tissue was resected and it amounted to near complete resection. During resection, prostatic chips were rather yellowish but no abscess cavities or calculi were encountered. His postoperative recovery was uneventful.

A stereotactic biopsy of the most worrisome area in the right upper inner quadrant demonstrated ductal carcinoma in-situ with microinvasion. Because of the diffuse extent of the malignant appearing calcifications, a mastectomy was recommended. On the morning of surgery, a 0.4 mCi dose of filtered Tc-99 m sulfur colloid was injected subdermally at the biopsy site. Two sentinel lymph nodes were identified, one at level I and a second, that was very medial and interpreted as a possible internal mammary node (Figure ). In the operating room, 5 ml of isosulfan blue dye was injected subdermally near the biopsy site, and the procedure was started after 5 minutes of skin massage. The first sentinel lymph node was found at level I and was blue and radioactive. Continued dissection at level I did not demonstrate any other radioactive or blue-stained lymph nodes. However, using the lymphoscintigraphy as our guide, we performed a more thorough search for the second sentinel node in the internal mammary chain and under the most medial part of the clavicle. Radioactivity was detected in the latter location, suggesting a level III sentinel lymph node, i.e., medial to the pectoralis minor. Since it was not easily accessible through the small axillary incision, we proceeded with the mastectomy then dissected the remaining sentinel node through a trans-pectoral approach. The medial aspect of the pectoralis major was divided in the direction of its fibers, thus allowing access to the level III space medial to the pectoralis minor, where a blue and radioactive lymph node was identified and removed (Figure ). The patient had an unremarkable postoperative course and was discharged on the first post-operative day.

She reported the appearance of eczema of the nipple-areola complex some years before, and the presence of a palpable mass for about two months; no mention was made of nipple discharge or ulceration. Histological examination revealed unifocal Paget's disease of the nipple underlying an invasive mucinous ductal breast carcinoma (pT2 2.2 cm) with focal aspects of intraductal carcinoma; none of the 21 nodes obtained upon axillary dissection were involved in the disease. Immunohistochemically, the tumour presented high estrogen and low progesterone receptor positivity, and a low-intermediate proliferative rate (Ki67 14%). No secondary lung, liver or bone lesions were detected. On the basis of the disease stage and histology, and age at diagnosis, adjuvant hormonal treatment with tamoxifen was started on 9 January 1996.

The beginning of its slow growth in 2003 led to a dermatological evaluation being advised, but this was delayed by the patient until December 2004, when a biopsy was performed.

480,1557539-1,16901350,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1557539.xml,Effect of left atrial compliance on pulmonary artery pressure: a case report,"We report the case of a 9-year-old asymptomatic girl who presented a 3 on 6 holosystolic murmur, discovered during a cross sectional survey estimating rheumatic heart disease prevalence in schoolchildren of Maputo in Mozambique. The apical impulse was displaced to the left, and a third heart sound and a short diastolic rumble reflect the rapid and voluminous left ventricular filling. No hepatomegaly or other right ventricular failure was found. According to the physical examination, the severe mitral regurgitation was estimated on the trans-thoracic echocardiography, using the PISA method (effective regurgitant orifice of 26 mm2, body mass index of 0.80 m2). Though unfortunately frequent in sub-Saharan Africa, this case draws a particular attention. As seen on the figure, the giant left atrium (73 cm2, 2-D four cavities apical view) contrasted with a normal pulmonary artery pressure estimated on Doppler analysis of the minimal tricuspid regurgitation (Doppler velocity 2.45 m/s, giving a systolic pulmonary artery pressure about 29 mmHg), well correlated with normal convexity of the interventricular septum and low speed of the pulmonary diastolic flow. This profile illustrated the important role that left atrial compliance may have on pulmonary artery pressure.
Pressure decay across the mitral valve depends on mitral valve area, trans-mitral gradient, and atrio-ventricular compliance []. Atrio-ventricular compliance can be estimated by Doppler echocardiography from the ratio of mitral valve effective orifice area (calculated by the continuity equation, cm2) and E-wave downslope (cm/s2); according of Flachskampf et al. [] the net auriculo-ventricular compliance (Cn) can be calculated as follows: Cn = 1270 × (MVA/E dv/dt) (ml/mmHg) [MVA: mitral valve area in cm2. E dv/dt: E wave downslope of the mitral Doppler signal in cm/sec2]. Atrio-ventricular compliance implies compliance characteristics of the both chambers, atrium and ventricle, as a single unit. When the compliance of either of these chambers is normal, any abnormality of atrio-ventricular compliance reflects abnormal compliance of the other. In case of pure mitral stenosis in young people without additional cardiac pathology, the left ventricle compliance is expected to be normal, and atrio-ventricular compliance is also equivalent to the left atrial compliance, and is a major independent determinant of pulmonary artery pressure measured by catheterization []. This low atrial compliance may explain the overestimation of mitral valve area by pressure half-time, in comparison with continuity equation method or planimetry. Moreover, this limitation of the pressure half-time method is well recognized in the setting of percutaneous mitral valvotomy, which induces substantial changes in chamber compliance within a short period of time.
On the opposite, in case of mitral regurgitation, very few data are reported. Echocardiographic atrio-ventricular compliance evaluation may remain difficult because of difficulties to assess to the mitral valve area. In addition, on the contrary of mitral stenosis, in which auriculo-ventricular is essentially dictated by atrial compliance, auriculo-ventricular compliance in mitral regurgitation is more difficult to evaluate. However in mitral regurgitation, atrial size is known to be proportional to its compliance [], and may explain a normal pulmonary artery pressure in spite of a chronic severe mitral regurgitation.","[[9.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['heart', 'apical', 'heart', 'left ventricular', 'right ventricular', 'mitral', 'regurgitant orifice', 'body', 'left atrium', 'four cavities', 'pulmonary artery', 'tricuspid', 'pulmonary artery', 'interventricular septum', 'pulmonary', 'left atrial', 'pulmonary artery', 'mitral valve', 'mitral valve area', 'trans-mitral', 'atrio-ventricular', 'Atrio-ventricular', 'mitral valve', 'orifice area', 'auriculo-ventricular', 'mitral valve area', 'mitral', 'Atrio-ventricular', 'both chambers', 'atrium', 'ventricle', 'chambers', 'atrio-ventricular', 'mitral', 'cardiac', 'left ventricle', 'atrio-ventricular', 'left atrial', 'pulmonary artery', 'atrial', 'mitral valve area', 'chamber', 'mitral', 'mitral valve area', 'mitral', 'auriculo-ventricular', 'atrial', 'auriculo-ventricular', 'mitral', 'mitral', 'atrial', 'pulmonary artery', 'mitral']","['asymptomatic', 'holosystolic murmur', 'rheumatic heart disease', 'apical impulse was displaced to the left', 'third heart sound', 'diastolic rumble', 'rapid and voluminous left ventricular filling', 'hepatomegaly', 'right ventricular failure', 'mitral regurgitation', 'giant left atrium', 'normal pulmonary artery pressure', 'tricuspid regurgitation', 'normal convexity of the interventricular septum', 'low speed of the pulmonary diastolic flow', 'left atrial compliance', 'pulmonary artery pressure', 'Pressure decay across the mitral valve', 'trans-mitral gradient', 'atrio-ventricular compliance', 'Atrio-ventricular compliance', 'compliance characteristics of the both chambers', 'single unit', 'compliance of either of these chambers is normal', 'abnormality of atrio-ventricular compliance', 'abnormal compliance', 'mitral stenosis', 'left ventricle compliance is expected to be normal', 'atrio-ventricular compliance', 'atrio-ventricular compliance is also equivalent', 'left atrial compliance', 'low atrial compliance', 'changes in chamber compliance', 'mitral regurgitation', 'mitral stenosis', 'atrial compliance', 'auriculo-ventricular compliance', 'mitral regurgitation', 'mitral regurgitation', 'atrial size is known to be proportional to its compliance', 'normal pulmonary artery pressure', 'mitral regurgitation']",[],['9'],"['cross sectional survey', 'physical examination', 'trans-thoracic echocardiography', 'effective regurgitant orifice', 'body mass index', '2-D four cavities apical view', 'pulmonary artery pressure', 'Doppler analysis', 'Doppler velocity', 'systolic pulmonary artery pressure', 'Doppler echocardiography', 'net auriculo-ventricular compliance (Cn)', 'Cn', 'MVA/E dv/dt', 'MVA', 'E dv/dt', 'catheterization', 'percutaneous mitral valvotomy', 'Echocardiographic atrio-ventricular compliance evaluation', 'pulmonary artery pressure']",[]

C level 38 iu/dl/normal range > 50 iu/dl) presented with a
five-week history of an atraumatic cystic swelling in the anterior
aspect of the right thigh. Clinically this cystic lesion was
typical of a haemophilic pseudotumour.
On examination there was an 8 × 10 cm mass in the
anterior compartment of the right thigh which was tender to
palpation.
Ultrasound scan examination revealed a large
heterogeneous mass of mixed echotexture with a central area of
liquefaction consistent with an intramuscular haematoma. A
subsequent angiogram showed no evidence of vessels
supplying the lesion or the presence of arteriovenous
malformations. MRI scanning confirmed an 18 × 
10 × 11 cm loculated cystic lesion in the anterior
compartment of the thigh involving the vastus intermedius and
vastus medialis muscles. T1 weighting (T1W) demonstrated a lesion
with peripheral high signal (). Gradient-echo
T2-weighted images revealed marked signal drop out centrally due
to magnetic susceptibility artefact from altered blood products,
usually haemosiderin (). The mass was shown to
extend posteriorly as far as the medial cortex of the femur and
medially to the femoral canal (). No extension
into bone was seen. It was concluded that appearances were
consistent with those of an organising haematoma. Given the past
medical history, a provisional diagnosis of haemophilic
pseudotumour was made.
Standard conservative treatment was commenced with a continuous
infusion of factor VIII, analgesia, and bed rest. Despite this,
the pain and swelling increased over the next five days and it was
decided to evacuate the haematoma. The haematoma was excised and
approximately one litre of freshly clotted and organised blood was
drained. Haemostasis was achieved and the entire cavity packed.
However, over the following seven days the swelling in the right
thigh recurred. A further MRI scan was performed and the findings
were once more consistent with further haematoma formation.
Approximately 1 litre of clotted blood was drained under
ultrasound guidance.
Six weeks after the initial presentation the swelling recurred
with an overall increase in size. It was decided to perform an
open exploration, and a biopsy was taken of the cyst wall.
Subsequent histology revealed poorly differentiated synovial
sarcoma. Staging of the tumour was performed with a CT of the
thorax which demonstrated pulmonary metastatic disease.
The tumour was found to be unresectable and a complete
disarticulation of the hip was subsequently performed. The patient
went on to a course of combination chemotherapy.","[[36.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['anterior\naspect of the right thigh', 'anterior compartment of the right thigh', 'intramuscular', 'vessels', 'arteriovenous', 'anterior\ncompartment of the thigh', 'vastus intermedius', 'vastus medialis muscles', 'medial cortex of the femur', 'medially to the femoral canal', 'bone', 'cavity', 'right\nthigh', 'cyst wall', 'synovial', 'thorax', 'pulmonary', 'hip']","['haemophilia A', 'atraumatic cystic swelling', 'cystic lesion', 'haemophilic pseudotumour', 'mass', 'tender to\npalpation', 'heterogeneous mass', 'central area of\nliquefaction', 'intramuscular haematoma', 'vessels\nsupplying the lesion', 'arteriovenous\nmalformations', 'cystic lesion', 'lesion', 'peripheral high signal', 'signal drop out centrally', 'magnetic susceptibility artefact', 'altered blood products', 'haemosiderin', 'mass', 'extension\ninto bone', 'organising haematoma', 'haemophilic\npseudotumour', 'pain', 'swelling', 'haematoma', 'haematoma', 'Haemostasis', 'swelling', 'haematoma formation', 'clotted blood', 'swelling', 'cyst wall', 'synovial\nsarcoma', 'tumour', 'pulmonary metastatic disease', 'tumour']","['haemosiderin', 'factor VIII']",['36'],"['F VIII :\nC level', 'Ultrasound scan', 'angiogram', 'MRI scanning', 'T1 weighting (T1W)', 'Gradient-echo\nT2-weighted images', 'Standard conservative treatment', 'analgesia', 'bed rest', 'evacuate the haematoma', 'haematoma was excised', 'approximately one litre of freshly clotted and organised blood was\ndrained', 'entire cavity packed', 'MRI scan', 'Approximately 1 litre of clotted blood was drained under\nultrasound guidance', '1 litre of clotted blood was drained under\nultrasound guidance', 'open exploration', 'biopsy', 'histology', 'Staging of the tumour', 'Staging of the tumour', 'CT of the\nthorax', 'complete\ndisarticulation of the hip', 'combination chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy']","['five-week', 'over the next five days', 'over the next five days', 'over the following seven days', 'Six weeks']"

imatinib mesylate (Glivec, Novartis) 400 mg/day in October
2003. Her adjusted serum calcium was 2.54 mmol/L (normal range
2.2–2.55). Imatinib was well tolerated, and her tumour mass
slowly responded to treatment. She was active (performance status
1), had a normal diet and no evidence of malabsorption. During the
fifth month of therapy, she complained of increasing muscle
twitches and cramps, locked fingers, and spasm of the tongue. Her
adjusted serum calcium was 2.28 and magnesium 0.75
(0.7–0.95) mmol/L, both at the lower limit of the normal ranges.
On stopping imatinib, the symptoms rapidly resolved, and the serum
calcium and magnesium recovered to 2.37 and 1.0 mmol/L
respectively (). Imatinib was restarted after
3 weeks, with oral calcium and magnesium supplements, but the
cramps recurred. She was then given quinine sulphate
300 mg/day, with complete resolution of the cramps. Fifteen
months later, she continues on imatinib 400 mg/day with

hearing loss and progressive pain complaints in his face on the
right side since one month. Physical examination showed a glue ear
on the right side and mild trismus. No other abnormalities were
found, especially no mucosal lesions or swelling in the neck.
CT and MRI showed a large tumor in the right infratemporal fossa
with intracranial extension through the foramen ovale to the
cavernous sinus and growth in the posterior wall of the maxillary
sinus and destruction of the ascending part of the mandible
().
A transantral biopsy through the maxillary sinus showed on
histopathological examination a malignant peripheral nerve sheath
tumor. CT-scans of the chest and abdomen and bone scintigraphy did
not show signs of distant metastases.
He underwent a resection consisting of craniotomy, parotidectomy,
maxillectomy, and segmental mandibula resection with selective
neck dissection of level I-III. The defect was reconstructed with
a free vascularized iliac crest flap. His postoperative course was
uneventful. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen
() revealed positive surgical margins. No
lymph node metastases were found in the neck dissection specimen.
He received postoperative radiotherapy to a total dose of
60 Gy in 30 fractions.
Unfortunately, 5 months post-operative he developed a subcutaneous
metastasis in the temporal scar of the craniotomy
(). An MRI showed that the underlying bone was
intact (). Metastases were also present in the
neck on the right-hand side. He was treated with 8 cycles of
doxorubicin. There was a complete response of both lesions. After
one month he developed a recurrence on the same place of his scalp
again. An MRI showed no signs of recurrence in the neck.
Since no accepted standard treatment was left, we decided to
propose an experimental approach in the form of intratumoral
injection of bleomycine with electroporation therapy. After
informed consent was obtained, the lesion of 50 × 35 mm
was uniformly infiltrated with 60 USP-E bleomycin (4 USP-E/mL)
under general anesthesia. After five minutes the tumor and a safe
margin of 0.5 cm were electroporated using a six-needle
array applicator connected to the MedPulser system (Genetronics 
Inc, San Diego, California), which transforms sinusoidal
electrical energy pattern []. Tumor and margin
were treated with 63 overlapping applicator placements
(). Gradually the tumor became increasingly
necrotic and demarcated from the surrounding tissue. The wound was
covered by hemorrhagic crusts. He had no pain complaints. After 10
weeks no tumor was seen anymore. Secondary healing started from
the margins of the wound (). Two months after
EPT he developed a recurrence in his neck, for which he was
treated with ifosfamide. This wound healing was delayed due to his
chemotherapy courses. He is presently (17 months after
electroporation) without disease on his scalp and is doing
reasonably well.","[[24.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['face', 'ear', 'mucosal', 'neck', 'right infratemporal fossa', 'intracranial', 'foramen ovale to the\ncavernous sinus', 'posterior wall of the maxillary\nsinus', 'maxillary\nsinus', 'ascending part of the mandible', 'transantral', 'maxillary sinus', 'peripheral nerve sheath', 'chest', 'abdomen', 'bone', 'segmental mandibula', 'neck', 'level I-III', 'iliac crest', 'lymph node', 'neck dissection specimen', 'subcutaneous', 'temporal scar of the craniotomy', 'bone', 'neck on the right-hand side', 'scalp', 'neck', 'surrounding tissue', 'margins of the wound', 'neck', 'scalp']","['hearing loss', 'pain', 'glue ear', 'trismus', 'abnormalities', 'mucosal lesions', 'lesions', 'swelling', 'tumor', 'intracranial extension', 'growth', 'destruction of the ascending part of the mandible', 'malignant peripheral nerve sheath\ntumor', 'distant metastases', 'postoperative course was\nuneventful', 'surgical margins', 'lymph node metastases', 'subcutaneous\nmetastasis', 'Metastases', 'complete response of both lesions', 'recurrence', 'tumor', 'transforms sinusoidal\nelectrical energy pattern', 'Tumor', 'tumor', 'wound', 'hemorrhagic crusts', 'pain', 'tumor', 'Secondary healing', 'recurrence', 'wound', 'wound healing', 'disease', 'doing\nreasonably well']","['doxorubicin', 'bleomycine', 'bleomycin', 'ifosfamide']","['24', 'Inc, San Diego, California']","['Physical examination', 'CT', 'MRI', 'transantral biopsy', 'histopathological examination', 'CT-scans of the chest and abdomen', 'bone scintigraphy', 'resection', 'craniotomy', 'parotidectomy', 'maxillectomy', 'segmental mandibula resection', 'selective\nneck dissection of level I-III', 'defect was reconstructed with\na free vascularized iliac crest flap', 'Histopathological examination', 'Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen', 'radiotherapy', 'MRI', 'MRI', 'treatment', 'intratumoral\ninjection of bleomycine', 'electroporation therapy', 'general anesthesia', 'tumor and a safe\nmargin of 0.5 cm were electroporated using a six-needle\narray applicator connected to the MedPulser system', '63 overlapping applicator placements', 'EPT', 'chemotherapy', 'electroporation']","['since one month', 'since one month', 'postoperative', '5 months', 'post-operative', '10\nweeks', 'Two months', '17 months']"

He was suffering from persistent epiphora for about one year, which had been diagnosed as chronic dacryocystitis due to right nasolacrimal duct obstruction, while he had undergone probing of the right nasolacrimal duct once, by his ophthalmologist. The patient also referred a mild pain in the area of median canthus, which was more intense during the night and relieved with aspirin uptake. In our department, clinical examination revealed only a small, firm mass, palpated in the middle angle of the right orbit. Nasal endoscopy revealed no intranasal pathology. There was normal ocular motility and no eyeball displacement.
A Computed Tomography scan was performed, which showed a bone density mass within the right ethmoid air cells. The mass revealed sharp and well defined margins, extending laterally through the lamina papyracea, to the ipsilateral right orbit (Figure ). Subsequently, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan was performed. Coronal, T1-weithted, post-contrast image, confirmed the presence of the mass filling the anterior portion of the right ethmoid air cells. The mass demonstrated patchy enhancement and protruded into the adjacent orbit. It should be noted that on MRI the mass depicted soft tissue intensity and enhanced following contrast administration (Figure ).
The mass was removed via an external ethmoidectomy approach. Intraoperatively it was noticed that the mass compressed the lacrimal sac, while no dacryocystorhinostomy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed that, the specimen mostly consisted of cancellous bone particles, some of which appeared to have distorted architecture, because of an interlacing network of variably sized, shaped and mineralized osteoid trabeculae. There was a rimming of osteoblasts surrounding the trabeculae. The intertrabecular spaces were occupied by loose connective tissue (Figure ). Focally dense sclerotic bone was recognized surrounding the above structures (Figure ). Diagnosis of ethmoid bone Osteoid Osteoma was set.
One year after the operation the patient was free of symptoms, while no recurrence occurred.","[[16.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['right nasolacrimal duct', 'right nasolacrimal duct', 'area of median canthus', 'middle angle of the right orbit', 'Nasal', 'intranasal', 'ocular', 'ocular motility', 'eyeball', 'bone', 'right ethmoid air cells', 'lamina papyracea', 'ipsilateral right orbit', 'anterior portion of the right ethmoid air cells', 'adjacent orbit', 'soft tissue', 'lacrimal sac', 'bone', 'osteoid trabeculae', 'osteoblasts surrounding the trabeculae', 'trabeculae', 'intertrabecular spaces', 'connective tissue', 'sclerotic bone', 'structures', 'ethmoid bone']","['epiphora', 'dacryocystitis', 'right nasolacrimal duct obstruction', 'pain', 'mass', 'intranasal pathology', 'normal ocular motility', 'eyeball displacement', 'bone density mass', 'mass', 'mass filling the anterior portion of the right ethmoid air cells', 'mass', 'mass', 'soft tissue intensity', 'mass', 'mass compressed the lacrimal sac', 'cancellous bone particles', 'distorted architecture', 'interlacing network of variably sized, shaped and mineralized osteoid trabeculae', 'rimming of osteoblasts surrounding the trabeculae', 'intertrabecular spaces were occupied by loose connective tissue', 'Focally dense sclerotic bone', 'ethmoid bone Osteoid Osteoma', 'Osteoid Osteoma', 'symptoms', 'recurrence']",['aspirin'],['16'],"['probing of the right nasolacrimal', 'probing of the right nasolacrimal duct', 'clinical examination', 'Nasal endoscopy', 'Computed Tomography scan', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan', 'MRI', 'MRI', 'mass was removed via an external ethmoidectomy approach', 'external ethmoidectomy', 'dacryocystorhinostomy', 'Histopathological examination', 'operation']","['about one year', 'Intraoperatively', 'Intraoperatively', 'One year']"

She was admitted for a few times in the past with a diagnosis of Major Depressive episode, Severe with Psychotic symptoms. She had been treated and stabilized with Mirtazapine 30 mg per day. She never smoked or consumed alcohol. She had no past history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Recently, she was admitted to Functional Ward with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe with Psychotic features (296.34). She presented to us with poor sleep, anergia, easy fatigability, poor concentration and low mood. She was noted to have psychomotor retardation with tear laden eyes and Veraguth's folds. She firmly believed that dead people were around her and trying to harm her. She also admitted hearing voices of dead people telling her to die. She appeared distressed and refused to accept food, drink and medications. She was apparently stable in her mood until a month prior to the current admission. She contracted lower respiratory tract infection a month ago, for which she was successfully treated with antibiotics. Despite this, her general condition deteriorated and she refused her medications, food and drink.
Her general physical condition deteriorated further due to poor hydration and self neglect. On admission, her neurological examination was unremarkable. Her CT Brain showed age related generalized atrophic changes. There was no evidence of space occupying lesion, focal areas of hemorrhage or infarction in the brain. Since there was no history of seizures, focal neurological deficits and CT Brain scan showing age related changes, EEG was not performed.
It was felt in Multidisciplinary team that she would improve with a short term course of eight ECTs. As she was unable to consent, second opinion was sought and she was posted for bipolar ECT twice a week for four weeks. Pre-ECT investigations, ECG, Chest X Ray, Blood sugar were normal. The ECT was carried out in conjunction with anesthesia and muscle relaxant medications to produce a mild generalized seizure. Though urea and creatinine levels were deranged initially, they got stabilized once the hydration had improved.
After the first two ECTs, she started accepting her food, drink and medications. Her general condition and hydration improved. She was cheerful and humorous. She started maintaining a good rapport, with appropriate conversation. She was more optimistic about her future.
Couple of days after the second ECT, she complained of hearing musical notes and songs during most of the times in a day. She heard ""Rose in a garden of weeds"" which she pointed out to be her favorite song during her childhood. This musical hallucination persisted up to few days after the last ECT. Though she experienced the musical hallucinations, they were not distressing to her. The patient neither experienced the hallucinations nor could recall the song after the completion of the course of ECT. Her depressive symptoms improved. She was stabilized on Mirtazapine 30 mg per day again and discharged to the residential home.
Musical hallucinations are not uncommon in many psychiatric illnesses, dementias, organic causes, drug induced problems etc; none has been reported to be associated with ECT therapy. Though Wengel SP et al reports that ECT is very effective in treating depression and musical hallucinations [], in our patient; ECT which was started for severe depression has shown a temporal association with the origin of musical hallucination during recovery from depression.

Two weeks later he was admitted to Accident and Emergency (A & E) department following generalised muscle ache, fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting and sweating for more than 24 hours. He was treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics and analgesics and discharged form A & E with a diagnosis of infection following dental intervention.10 days later this gentleman returned with complaint of shock like sensation in lower lips and a numb chin and was admitted in medical ward.
His past medical history was of diet controlled diabetes mellitus, well controlled hypertension and hypothyroidism on regular thyroxine.
Examination revealed absent sensation to touch and pain in mandibular division of Trigeminal Cranial Nerve below the lower lip on right side. Other cranial nerves and central nervous system examination were normal. All other systems were found to be clinically normal.
Initial investigation showed an elevated C reactive protein (CRP)-139.2 mg/l and a slightly raised gamma glutamyl transferase-173 iu/l, normal full blood count, creatinine, urea and electrolytes, glucose, liver function test and chest X-ray at the time of initial presentation. The differential diagnosis at this stage was of a non-specific viral illness, atypical viral myositis or atypical Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Since the muscle ache, low grade fever persisted and the numbness of chin started to spread beyond the midline to other side a computerised tomography (CT) scan head was done which showed no focal lesions. Viral markers were negative and blood/urine culture showed no bacterial growth. Urine for Leptospirosis screen was also negative. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function and no evidence of bacterial endocarditis. Ultrasound abdomen was performed but poor views were found due to the patient's body habitus.
In the next 2 weeks the liver function test became deranged. CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) remained elevated. Slight weakness of left lower limb compared to right was noted together with new onset of right axillary lymphadenopathy (5 × 5 cm). The patient was managed by antibiotics, pain killers, vitamins and nutrition. In the meantime the renal function started to deteriorate and the patient became oliguric with signs of fluid overload, increasing potassium, urea and creatinine. The blood film done at this stage showed a leucoerythroblastic picture and lymphocytosis. The patient was hypercalcemic (3.0 mmol/l). Anaerobic blood culture showed growth of gram positive cocci for which Teicoplanin was started. The patient was admitted to ICU (Intensive care unit) at this stage for supporting renal and hepatic function.
We suspected a lymphoproliferative disorder at this time and decided to do a CT scan thorax and abdomen, Bone Marrow biopsy and biopsy of axillary lymph node.
CT scan thorax revealed a large solitary right axillary node but no other mediastinal or abdominal lymphadenopathy. Lung fields were clear with mild bilateral pleural effusion. There was bilateral renal enlargement clinically due to acute nephritis.
The patient was supported by continuous veno venous hemofiltraion (CVVH) because of worsening renal function via right femoral venous access. Arterial blood gas (ABG) showed worsening acidosis in spite of CVVH. pH-7.315, pO2-117.9 mmHg, PCo2-31.7 mm Hg, BE-9.4, HCO3-15.8 mmol/L. Filter was changed to a large size and predilution fluid volume increased. In spite of changes in CVVH acidosis improved a little and hence was started on NaHco3 infusion of 100 ml/hour to a total of 300 ml.
Bone marrow aspirate showed 70% infiltration with lymphoblastic lymphoma very aggressive type and unlikely to get into remission (Figure and ).

He had undergone a mechanical aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis 14 years ago which was followed 2 years later by repeat mechanical aortic valve replacement for streptococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis. His postoperative recovery following his second valve replacement was uneventful. He continued to be well and asymptomatic with a well healed sternal wound for the next 12 years. However, 12 years following his 2nd operation, he presented with a discharging sinus in epigastrium (fig ) which was initially treated with dressings and antibiotics by his GP. Exploration of the sinus under general anaesthetic was undertaken after the sinus failed to heal. The sinus was in communication with anterior mediastinum by penetrating the rectus sheath and was divided at the point of entry into mediastinum and removed. All sternal wires were removed. Microbiology of the excised tissue revealed staphylococcus aureus infection and this was treated with appropriate antibiotics for 4 weeks. However, the wound failed to heal although he never developed any signs of systemic illness. A CT scan of chest showed an encapsulated mass extending from ascending aorta to the diaphragm and normal sternum. Transthoracic echocardiography ruled out pseudoaneurysm of ascending aorta, prosthetic endocarditis or aortic root abscess. An MR scan confirmed a longitudinal retrosternal mass extending from mid ascending aorta to the diaphragm (figs and ) and cutaneous fistulization to the epigastrium through left rectus sheath.
An exploratory secondary median sternotomy was made with cardiopulmonary bypass on standby. Heart and the great vessels were dissected out within the pericardial cavity. A nonpulsatile longitudinal 15 cm mass was found on the anterior surface of ascending aorta and right ventricle along the entire length of anterior mediastinum. At the level of the diaphragm, the mass exited the mediastinum by penetrating the left rectus sheath and communicated with the skin in the epigastrium. At the junction of the superior 1/3 and inferior 2/3, there was a branching tract extending from the main tract to the right and inferiorly over right atrium and the hilum of right lung. The upper part of the mass was aspirated with a wide bore needle when thick cheesy material came out (fig ). The entire mass and the branching tract were laid open (fig ), only the middle 2 inches of the mass over the right ventricle having no lumen. The superior half of the tract that lay open was, interestingly, filled with old suture material and Teflon pledgets in addition to thick cheesy material mentioned before. The inferior part of the tract, that had fistulized through the rectus sheath to the epigastric skin, was filled with yellow fresh pus and a piece of old temporary pacing wire. Both the white cheesy material and the pus were sent separately for bacteriological analysis and both grew staphylococcus aureus. The upper mass was almost completely excised except for a thin rim posteriorly which was densely adherent to aorta and the adjacent right atrium and right ventricle. The lower mass was completely excised along with the contiguous portions of rectus muscle, xiphoid, subcutaneous tissue, the sinus and the core of the epigastric skin. Through the same incision, the diaphragm and peritoneum were opened. The greater omentum, based on the right gastroepiploic pedicle, was freed from the greater curvature of the stomach, divided to the far left of the stomach and transposed into the chest to cover the entire raw area of the excised mass and sinus and secured in place with stitches (fig ). Patient received intravenous antibiotics for 6 weeks and was discharge home thereafter, his sternal wound having healed satisfactorily. At follow up 2 years later, he remains fit and well.","[[79.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['epigastrium', 'aortic valve', 'aortic', 'aortic valve', 'valve', 'valve', 'sternal', 'epigastrium', 'sinus', 'sinus', 'anterior mediastinum', 'mediastinum', 'rectus sheath', 'mediastinum', 'excised tissue', 'chest', 'ascending aorta to the diaphragm', 'sternum', 'Transthoracic', 'ascending aorta', 'aortic root', 'longitudinal retrosternal', 'mid ascending aorta to the diaphragm', 'cutaneous', 'epigastrium', 'left rectus sheath', 'cardiopulmonary', 'Heart', 'great vessels', 'pericardial cavity', 'anterior surface of ascending aorta', 'right ventricle', 'entire length of anterior mediastinum', 'diaphragm', 'mediastinum', 'left rectus sheath', 'skin', 'epigastrium', 'right atrium', 'hilum of right lung', 'branching tract', 'right ventricle', 'superior half of the tract', 'inferior part of the tract', 'rectus sheath to the epigastric skin', 'aorta', 'right atrium', 'right ventricle', 'contiguous portions of rectus muscle', 'xiphoid', 'subcutaneous tissue', 'sinus', 'core of the epigastric skin', 'diaphragm', 'peritoneum', 'greater omentum', 'right gastroepiploic pedicle', 'greater curvature of the stomach', 'left of the stomach', 'chest', 'entire raw area of the excised mass and sinus', 'sternal']","['discharging sinus', 'aortic stenosis', 'streptococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis', 'postoperative recovery', 'recovery', 'well', 'asymptomatic', 'sternal wound', 'discharging sinus', 'sinus failed to heal', 'sinus was in communication with anterior mediastinum', 'staphylococcus aureus infection', 'wound', 'systemic illness', 'encapsulated mass', 'normal sternum', 'pseudoaneurysm of ascending aorta', 'prosthetic endocarditis', 'aortic root abscess', 'longitudinal retrosternal mass', 'cutaneous fistulization', 'mass', 'mass exited the mediastinum', 'right atrium and the hilum of right lung', 'upper part of the mass', 'entire mass', 'mass', 'lumen', 'superior half of the tract that lay open', 'cheesy material', 'fistulized', 'filled with yellow fresh pus', 'piece of old temporary pacing wire', 'white cheesy material', 'pus', 'staphylococcus aureus', 'upper mass', 'rim posteriorly', 'lower mass', 'sternal wound', 'fit', 'well']",[],['79'],"['mechanical aortic valve replacement', 'mechanical aortic valve replacement', 'valve replacement', '2nd operation', 'dressings', 'antibiotics', 'Exploration of the sinus under general anaesthetic', 'divided at the point of entry into mediastinum and removed', 'All sternal wires were removed', 'Microbiology of the excised tissue', 'antibiotics', 'CT scan', 'CT scan of chest', 'Transthoracic echocardiography', 'MR scan', 'exploratory secondary median sternotomy', 'cardiopulmonary bypass', 'Heart and the great vessels were dissected out within the pericardial cavity', 'upper part of the mass was aspirated with a wide bore needle when thick cheesy material came out', 'entire mass and the branching tract were laid open', 'bacteriological analysis', 'upper mass was almost completely excised', 'lower mass was completely excised', 'lower mass was completely excised along with the contiguous portions of rectus muscle, xiphoid, subcutaneous tissue, the sinus and the core of the epigastric skin', 'Through the same incision, the diaphragm and peritoneum were opened', 'secured in place with stitches', 'antibiotics']","['14 years ago', '14 years ago', '2 years later', 'postoperative', 'postoperative', 'next 12 years', '2 years later', '2 years later']"

The US showed a hypoechoic mass with calcifications and multiple non-homogeneous areas in the right hepatic lobe. Her past medical history was unremarkable. The menarche was at the age of 13, menstrual periods were regular. Physiologic menopause occurred when she was 49 years old. She had no history of drug or alcohol abuse. Physical examination was unremarkable.
Liver function tests and urine analysis were within normal limits. Hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HBs antibody and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were negative. Serum tumor markers (CEA, CA 19–9 and α-fetoprotein) were also negative. Moreover, laboratory and serology data ruled out liver abscess, amebae or hydatid cyst.
Abdominal computer tomography (CT) showed a voluminous lesion measuring 142 × 126 × 132 mm and localized in the IV, VII, and VIII hepatic segments Figure ); it also showed the presence of multicystic areas with calcifications (Figure ). The lesion was well defined, hypodense and with a hyperdense rim. The arterial phase exhibited significant enhancement during the arterial phase, decreasing during the portal phase, until becoming isodense relative to the liver in delayed scans. CT findings were characteristic for a giant hepatic adenoma. Since the diagnostic work-up supported the hypothesis of a hepatic adenoma, the surgical treatment was advocated. In this case surgery was the only therapeutic option. In fact, hepatic adenomas larger than 5 cm should be surgically removed due to the risk of hemorrhage and/or malignant transformation. No pre-operative biopsy was performed since its outcome would not have influenced the surgical treatment.
The patient was brought to the OR and a bilateral subcostal incision was performed. A voluminous hepatic lesion involving IV, VII and IVb segments was found. There was a first attempt to enucleate the mass from the surrounding liver parenchyma. However, since the mass was closely adherent to the right and middle hepatic veins, a liver resection was carried out. After performing the Pringle maneuver, parenchymal dissection was accomplished using the cavitational ultrasonic surgical aspirator. Hemostasis was achieved using argon beam coagulator, bipolar forceps and suture ligatures.
The specimen measured 19 × 15 × 7 cm. The mass appeared as a well circumscribed green-brown colored tumour with hemorrhagic areas and a cyst of 6 cm in diameter, with macroscopic calcification within. The surrounding liver tissue was normal.
Microscopically, the lesion was composed of mature hepatocytes organized in sheets, mainly 2 cells thick. The cells had large cytoplasms and round nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli. Some bi-nucleated cells were present. Gomori's staining showed that reticulin production was preserved within the proliferation. No vascular invasion was present. Large areas of hemorrhage and focal dilatation of peliosis-like sinusoid were present. A cystic formation with fibrotic and focally calcified wall was found within the lesion. Histologically, in the context of the wall, lamellar bone forming trabeculae intermingled with fat tissue containing myeloid and erythroid cells (bone marrow metaplasia) were found (Figure and ). CD 34 immunostaining was negative. Therefore, a diagnosis of hepatocellular adenoma was established.
The patient started oral intake on 4th postoperative day, with a carbohydrate-based diet. No signs of liver failure were recorded and the patient was discharged on day 13 post-op, after removing the J-P drains.","[[58.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['liver', 'abdominal', 'right hepatic lobe', 'Liver', 'liver', 'Abdominal', 'IV, VII, and VIII hepatic segments', 'arterial phase', 'arterial phase', 'portal phase', 'liver', 'hepatic', 'hepatic', 'hepatic', 'bilateral subcostal', 'hepatic', 'IV, VII and IVb segments', 'right and middle hepatic veins', 'liver', 'parenchymal', 'liver tissue', 'peliosis-like sinusoid', 'wall', 'wall', 'lamellar bone', 'bone marrow', 'liver']","['asymptomatic', 'liver mass', 'hypoechoic mass', 'calcifications', 'non-homogeneous areas', 'unremarkable', 'menarche', 'menstrual periods were regular', 'Physiologic menopause', 'drug or alcohol abuse', 'liver abscess', 'amebae', 'hydatid cyst', 'lesion', 'multicystic areas', 'calcifications', 'lesion', 'enhancement', 'isodense', 'hepatic adenoma', 'hepatic adenoma', 'hepatic adenomas', 'hemorrhage', 'malignant transformation', 'hepatic lesion', 'mass', 'mass', 'tumour', 'hemorrhagic areas', 'cyst', 'macroscopic calcification', 'liver tissue was normal', 'lesion', 'hepatocytes', 'cells had large cytoplasms', 'round nuclei', 'inconspicuous nucleoli', 'bi-nucleated cells', 'reticulin production was preserved within the proliferation', 'vascular invasion', 'hemorrhage', 'focal dilatation of peliosis-like sinusoid', 'cystic formation', 'fibrotic and focally calcified wall', 'lesion', 'lamellar bone forming trabeculae', 'lamellar bone forming trabeculae intermingled with fat tissue', 'fat tissue', 'myeloid', 'erythroid cells', 'bone marrow metaplasia', 'hepatocellular adenoma', 'liver failure']",[],"['58', '13', '49', 'OR']","['abdominal ultrasonography (US)', 'US', 'Physical examination', 'Liver function tests', 'urine analysis', 'Hepatitis B surface antigen', 'anti-HBs antibody', 'anti-hepatitis C virus antibody', 'Serum tumor markers', 'CEA', '-fetoprotein', 'laboratory', 'serology data', 'Abdominal computer tomography (CT)', 'CT', 'diagnostic work-up', 'surgical treatment', 'surgery', 'surgically removed', 'biopsy', 'surgical treatment', 'bilateral subcostal incision', 'enucleate the mass from the surrounding liver parenchyma', 'liver resection', 'Pringle maneuver', 'parenchymal dissection was accomplished using the cavitational ultrasonic surgical aspirator', 'Hemostasis was achieved using argon beam coagulator, bipolar forceps and suture ligatures', 'Microscopically', ""Gomori's staining"", 'CD 34 immunostaining', 'oral intake', 'carbohydrate-based diet', 'removing the J-P drains']","['pre-operative', '4th postoperative day', 'post-op']"

The family history of the patient revealed a similar disease in his mother, which recurred twice (in 1994 and in 2000). The patient referred recurrent epistaxis since the age of 7, treated with cold packs, and a not better specified conjunctival inflammation cured with eyedrops in September 2005. Physical examination showed an erythematous, papillomatous mass, 3 cm in diameter, obstructing the right nasal cavity, attached by a narrow pedicle to the nasal septum. No abnormality was seen in the controlateral nasal cavity or nasopharynx. The mass was resected endoscopically and the base of implant was electrocoagulated. The patient did not assume any drug therapy and, until today, after five months of follow-up, during which he underwent a clinical exam twice, he is healthy with no sign of recurrence.
The excised mass weighed 4 grams, measured a maximum diameter of 3 cm, was pink, with a fleshy consistence, studded with whitish spots on its surface. On histological examination, the lesion showed the characteristic features of the rhinosporidiosis: the polypoid fibroconnective stroma, covered by flat multi-stratified squamous epithelium, contained many globular cysts. Each of these cysts represented a thick-walled sporangium containing numerous ""daughter spores"" in different stages of development (Fig. ). The stroma contained a vascular fibroconnective tissue with fibroblasts and myofibroblasts and an inflammatory infiltrate (neutrophil granulocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells and histiocytes). Histochemical stains such as PAS, GMS (Fig. ) and mucicarmine were used to establish the correct diagnosis of rhinosporidiosis. Morphological criteria were based on the diameter of the endospores and sporangia, respectively 5–10 μm and 50–1000 μm.

Six months prior to this acute admission, the patient was treated empirically with fluconazole for a histologically proven necrotising Candida infection of the bladder. Her acute obstruction was managed by the insertion of bilateral nephrostomy catheters. On the day of the procedure she developed rigors, vomiting and right loin pain despite antibiotic cover with amoxicillin (500 mg tds). She was pyrexial (38.9°C), her inflammatory markers were increased (WBC 23.2 × 109/l, neutrophils 21.8 × 109/l, CRP 300 mg/l) and her renal function compromised (creatinine 333 μmol/l). The blood and nephrostomy urine cultures grew a non- albicans Candida species. The pre-morbid history suggested that the current non-albicans Candida isolate might be an azole-resistant strain and on the basis of her acute renal failure, the patient was commenced on empirical intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome 1 mg/kg/od). The organism was subsequently identified as C.glabrata with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole and itraconazole MIC fluconazole 16.0 mg/l, itraconazole 1.0 mg/l) but susceptible to amphotericin B (MIC 1.0 mg/l), caspofungin (MIC 0.5 mg/l), voriconazole (MIC < 0.03 mg/l).
The patient was treated for four weeks with iv liposomal amphotericin B during which time her left nephrostomy tube was replaced by a ureteric stent. Four months later she was readmitted to the hospital for an elective right ureteric stent insertion but she developed a severe urosepsis (temperature 39.4°C, WBC 45.5 × 109/l, CRP > 300 mg/l, creatinine 407 μmol/l) during the procedure which was abandoned. AmBisome (1 mg/kg/od) was given shortly after the procedure but did not prevent the need for intensive care support. Blood cultures and urostomy urine again grew the azole resistant C.glabrata. Due to the recurrence of Candida sepsis despite previous treatment with amphotericin B and because of her acute renal failure it was felt that a different class of anti-fungal agent with good activity against C.glabrata and minimal nephrotoxicity should be used. Amphotericin B was therefore stopped after three days and replaced by iv caspofungin (70 mg loading dose, 50 mg od). Caspofungin was continued for 12 days during which time her blood and catheter urine became sterile and her inflammatory markers and temperature normalised.
However, as the stenting of her right kidney was unsuccessful, attributed to multiple intra-renal strictures and irregularity of the urothelial outline, a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was inserted to allow long-term drainage. This time AmBisome was given one day prior to the procedure and continued for a total of 11 days during which time no sepsis occurred. Nevertheless, nephrostomy fluid analysis revealed large numbers of pus and yeast cells and again grew the azole resistant C.glabrata. Because of the persistent C. glabrata infection of the renal pelvices, despite treatment with iv liposomal amphotericin B followed by a course of caspofungin, it was felt that active local irrigation with amphotericin B was necessary to reduce the fungal load and to ensure that the antifungal agent achieved the site of infection. Five ml of conventional amphotericin B (Fungizone, 200 μg/ml) was instilled into the nephrostomy tube which was then clamped for 30–60 minutes at a time. This procedure was repeated four times daily for four days.

493,1560395-1,16914043,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1560395.xml,Adenoid basal carcinoma of the cervix in a 20-year-old female: a case report,"A 20-year-old African American female presented with a history of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) on Pap smear. A colposcopy was performed and yielded three cervical biopsies and an endocervical curettage, all of which showed no significant pathologic alteration with exception of one cervical biopsy that showed HPV-effect. Still concerned with the patient's HSIL result, clinicians performed a cervical loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), during which multiple erosions of inflammation were observed to be overlying the cervix.
5-um sections from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue were used for routine light microscopic study as well as immunohistochemical analysis including the antibodies against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (1:100), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) (prediluted), and collagen IV (1:40) (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). These immunohistochemical stains were performed by a labeled avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase method using commercially available monoclonal antibodies and DAB as the chromogen. In order to provide negative controls on patient tissue and thereby ensure specificity of the reactions, the aforementioned antibodies were substituted for an unrelated antibody during the incubation procedure. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue from kidney, prostate, and breast were used as positive controls for collagen IV, PSA, and EMA, respectively.
The gross LEEP specimen measured 1.3 cm in diameter and 0.4 cm in depth. The cervical mucosa was purple-tan, smooth and glistening. No demonstrable lesions were present.
Microscopically, hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections showed cervical stroma involved by scattered cellular proliferations arranged in nests with a striking peripheral palisading arrangement (Fig. ) and microcyst formation. A stromal reaction to these nests was not present (Fig. ). The cells were uniform, round to oval, and had scant cytoplasm. Nuclei were hyperchromatic, showing inconspicuous nucleoli and minimal nuclear atypia. Mitotic figures were not identified. The squamous epithelium showed occasional, sporadic foci of lymphocytic infiltration not necessarily coincident to the underlying tumor nests. Definitive squamous intraepithelial lesions were not present.
In order to further elucidate the nature of the tumor, immunohistochemical stains were performed. A stain for EMA showed strong, diffuse cellular membrane staining of the tumor cells (Fig. ), whereas stains for PSA and collagen IV did not highlight cells from the lesion. The positive control tissues were diffusely and strongly positive for their respective antibodies.
Adenoid basal carcinoma is a rare, indolent lesion of the uterine cervix most commonly occurring in postmenopausal African-American females, although some recent reports have shown that these tumors can also occur in Asian patients [-]. Its cellular origin remains uncertain, but immunohistochemical evidence has shown that this lesion may originate from the reserve cell layer of the cervical epithelium [].
Cviko [] enumerated the four distinct components of ABC: a classic HSIL; a limited invasive component with squamoid maturation, often with a discrete layer of peripheral basal cells; an outgrowth of small basal cells from either HSIL or squamoid areas; and focal endocervical (adenoid) differentiation.
Histologically, ABC has been described as a proliferation of nested uniform, bland basaloid cells with a peripheral palisading pattern. Mild chromatin abnormalities are present with small nucleoli and rare mitoses. Cytologically, the neoplasm appears as discohesive groups of intact cells with overlapping nuclei, moderately high nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio, occasional peripheral palisading, finely granular chromatin, mild hyperchromasia, and small nucleoli [].
Immunohistochemical characteristics include stain positivity for CK14, CK17, CK19 [] and Cytokeratin KL 1 []. Of the nine cases of ABC studied by Grayson [], all were positive for EMA but totally negative for collagen IV and laminin, compared to adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) which was positive for all three stains. Unfortunately, we were unable to perform a laminin stain on the tissue for this case, but the fact that collagen IV alone did not highlight any of the tumor cells (and again taking into consideration the architectural and cytologic features of the tumor) provides solid evidence that this lesion is indeed adenoid basal carcinoma, and not ACC.
Genetic studies have shown correlation with viral infection. Takeshima [] correlated the occurrence of ABC to human papilloma virus infection. Jones [] characterized the presence of HPV type 16 among the five cases he studied. Moreover, p53 gene alterations including wild type hyperexpression and p53 point mutational damage were noted. Our patient showed HPV-effect on a cervical biopsy, but the LEEP specimen revealed neither HPV changes nor squamous intraepithelial lesions.
The overwhelming majority of cases are benign owing to the low potential for recurrence and metastasis. This has led to an alternative designation, adenoid basal epithelioma. Brainard [] and colleagues, in their review of 12 cases, pointed out that adenoid basal carcinoma with typical features is not a malignant neoplasm, does not produce a visible lesion, does not metastasize, and never itself has caused death. Thus, they proposed that the name be changed to reflect the neoplasm's benignity.
Because of its favorable prognosis, this lesion should be distinguished from more malignant processes such as ACC, which carries a recurrent and metastatic potential; adenoma malignum (minimal deviation adenocarcinoma); and mesonephric adenocarcinoma. The most important of these to consider is ACC, which histologically can appear very similar to ABC. Furthermore, they both show positive reactivity to CEA, EMA, CK7, CK20, and CAM 5.2 []. However, cellular pleomorphism, mitoses, necrosis, stromal hyalinization, and metastasis are commonly identified in ACC but are rare or absent in ABC. Moreover, as previously discussed, immunohistochemical studies show positive reactivity to collagen IV and laminin for ACC whereas these stains do not highlight the tumor cells of ABC [].
Other entities to consider within the differential diagnosis include small cell carcinoma of the cervix, carcinoid tumor of the cervix, carcinosarcoma of the cervix, and ectopic prostatic tissue. The last of these was ruled out in our case by using a PSA immunohistochemical marker. Again, histologic, morphologic, and immunohistochemical characteristics of ABC should distinguish it from these other entities.","[[20.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['squamous intraepithelial', 'cervical', 'endocervical', 'cervical', 'cervical loop', 'cervix', 'tissue', 'kidney', 'prostate', 'breast', 'cervical mucosa', 'cervical stroma', 'squamous epithelium', 'squamous intraepithelial', 'cellular membrane', 'tissues', 'Adenoid basal', 'uterine cervix', 'reserve cell layer of the cervical epithelium', 'ABC', 'squamoid', 'peripheral basal cells', 'small basal cells', 'HSIL', 'squamoid areas', 'endocervical', 'adenoid', 'ABC', 'basaloid cells', 'adenoid', 'tissue', 'basal', 'cervical', 'adenoid basal', 'cellular', 'cervix', 'cervix', 'cervix', 'prostatic tissue']","['squamous intraepithelial lesion', 'HSIL', 'pathologic alteration', 'HPV-effect', 'erosions of inflammation', 'purple-tan', 'smooth', 'glistening', 'lesions', 'cellular proliferations arranged in nests', 'peripheral palisading arrangement', 'microcyst formation', 'stromal reaction to these nests', 'cells were uniform', 'round to oval', 'scant cytoplasm', 'Nuclei were hyperchromatic', 'inconspicuous nucleoli', 'nuclear atypia', 'Mitotic figures', 'lymphocytic infiltration', 'tumor nests', 'squamous intraepithelial lesions', 'tumor', 'cellular membrane staining of the tumor cells', 'highlight cells from the lesion', 'positive control tissues', 'Adenoid basal carcinoma', 'lesion', 'lesion of the uterine cervix', 'postmenopausal', 'tumors', 'lesion', 'HSIL', 'limited invasive component', 'squamoid maturation', 'discrete layer of peripheral basal cells', 'outgrowth of small basal cells', 'focal endocervical (adenoid) differentiation', 'proliferation of nested uniform', 'bland basaloid cells', 'peripheral palisading pattern', 'chromatin abnormalities', 'nucleoli', 'mitoses', 'neoplasm', 'discohesive groups of intact cells', 'overlapping nuclei', 'high nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio', 'peripheral palisading', 'granular chromatin', 'hyperchromasia', 'nucleoli', 'ABC', 'adenoid cystic carcinoma', 'ACC', 'tumor cells', 'tumor', 'lesion', 'adenoid basal carcinoma', 'ACC', 'viral infection', 'ABC', 'human papilloma virus infection', 'HPV', 'p53 gene alterations', 'wild type hyperexpression', 'p53 point mutational damage', 'HPV-effect', 'HPV changes', 'squamous intraepithelial lesions', 'adenoid basal epithelioma', 'adenoid basal carcinoma', 'malignant neoplasm', 'visible lesion', 'metastasize', 'death', ""neoplasm's"", 'lesion', 'malignant processes', 'ACC', 'metastatic potential', 'adenoma malignum', 'adenocarcinoma', 'mesonephric adenocarcinoma', 'ACC', 'ABC', 'cellular pleomorphism', 'mitoses', 'necrosis', 'stromal hyalinization', 'metastasis', 'ACC', 'ABC', 'positive reactivity to collagen IV and laminin for ACC', 'tumor cells of ABC', 'small cell carcinoma of the cervix', 'carcinoid tumor of the cervix', 'carcinosarcoma of the cervix', 'ectopic prostatic tissue']",[],"['20', 'Grayson', 'Jones', 'Brainard']","['Pap smear', 'colposcopy', 'cervical biopsies', 'endocervical curettage', 'cervical biopsy', 'HSIL', 'cervical loop electrosurgical excision procedure', 'LEEP', 'light microscopic study', 'immunohistochemical analysis', 'epithelial membrane antigen', 'EMA', 'collagen IV', 'immunohistochemical stains', 'monoclonal antibodies', 'DAB', 'incubation procedure', 'collagen IV', 'PSA', 'EMA', 'gross LEEP specimen', 'Microscopically, hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections', 'immunohistochemical stains', 'stain for EMA', 'stains for PSA and collagen IV', 'antibodies', 'immunohistochemical', 'Cviko', 'Immunohistochemical characteristics', 'stain', 'CK14', 'CK17', 'CK19', 'Cytokeratin KL 1', 'ABC', 'EMA', 'collagen IV', 'laminin', 'stains', 'laminin stain', 'collagen', 'collagen IV', 'Genetic studies', 'cervical biopsy', 'LEEP', 'CEA', 'EMA', 'CK7', 'CK20', 'CAM 5.2', 'immunohistochemical studies', 'stains', 'PSA immunohistochemical marker', 'histologic', 'morphologic', 'immunohistochemical characteristics of ABC']",[]

Although he had facial deformities since early childhood, he professed only to cosmetic embarassment, nasal blockage, mouth breathing, mild snoring and progressing bowing of his shins. There were no other affected family members. He was gainfully employed and had been riding a bicycle to work, when he skidded off the road into a sand patch, landing on his face. At the point of impact, he bruised his face. He was able to turn over, but immediately noticed some neck pain and weakness of all four limbs. He was just able to lift his arms and move his legs from side to side. He was transferred by ship from his island to our hospital and was seen three days after the injury. On examination, he had leontiasis ossea (leonine facies due to symmetrical frontal and maxillary bossing) (Figure ). Examination of the oral cavity showed a symmetric soft tissue bulge of the hard palate (Figure ). He had broad forearms, sausage like fingers and bowing of both legs with saber shins (Figure ). The nasal bridge was flat and elevated due to a soft tissue thickening (Figure &). No café au lait spots were observed. Neurological examination revealed grade 3 power (MRC scale) in his arms with pronounced distal hand muscle weakness and grade 2 power in his legs. All deep tendon reflexes were absent, plantar reflexes were extensor and there was a sensory level to all modalities at the groin.
MRI of the spine showed diffuse enlargement of the laminae, transverse processes and spinous processes of the entire spine (mainly involving the posterior elements) with cervical canal stenosis and a cervical cord contusion at C 4–5 level. On T1 weighted images the posterior elements were hyperintense. The facet joints of the cervical vertebrae were also enlarged. (Figure ) The cranio-vertebral junction was normal. Skull X-rays and CT scans (Figure ) with bone windows showed diffuse thickening of the inner and outer tables of all the skull bones with a widened diploe. The brain parenchyma, subarachnoid cisterns and paranasal sinuses were normal. His routine blood examinations, blood glucose, serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphate levels, and thyroid function tests were normal. Urinary mucopolysaccharides were absent. The clinico-radiological picture was compatible with a generalized form of PFD. He was initiated on IV methylprednisolone 1 gm OD for 5 days and was able to start walking in 5 days. He was discharged home on the 10th day with residual distal hand muscle weakness and grade 4 muscle power in his legs.","[[25.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['facial', 'nasal', 'mouth', 'shins', 'face', 'face', 'neck', 'all four limbs', 'arms', 'legs', 'ossea', 'frontal', 'maxillary', 'oral cavity', 'soft tissue', 'hard palate', 'forearms', 'fingers', 'both legs', 'shins', 'nasal bridge', 'soft tissue', 'Neurological', 'arms', 'distal hand muscle', 'legs', 'deep tendon', 'plantar', 'groin', 'laminae', 'entire spine', 'spine', 'posterior elements', 'cervical canal', 'cervical cord', 'C 4–5 level', 'posterior elements', 'facet joints of the cervical vertebrae', 'cranio-vertebral junction', 'Skull', 'bone windows', 'inner and outer tables of all the skull bones', 'brain parenchyma', 'subarachnoid cisterns', 'paranasal sinuses', 'thyroid', 'Urinary', 'distal hand muscle', 'muscle', 'legs']","['quadriparesis', 'fall', 'facial deformities', 'cosmetic embarassment', 'nasal blockage', 'mouth breathing', 'snoring', 'bowing of his shins', 'bruised', 'bruised his face', 'able to turn over', 'neck pain', 'weakness of all four limbs', 'able to lift his arms', 'move his legs from side to side', 'injury', 'leontiasis ossea', 'leonine facies', 'bossing', 'soft tissue bulge', 'soft tissue bulge of the hard palate', 'broad forearms', 'sausage like fingers', 'bowing of both legs', 'saber shins', 'flat', 'elevated', 'soft tissue thickening', 'café', 'café au lait spots', 'power', 'distal hand muscle weakness', 'power', 'deep tendon reflexes', 'plantar reflexes', 'plantar reflexes were extensor', 'sensory level to all modalities', 'enlargement of the laminae', 'transverse processes', 'spinous processes', 'cervical canal stenosis', 'cervical cord contusion', 'hyperintense', 'enlarged', 'cranio-vertebral junction was normal', 'thickening of the inner and outer tables of all the skull bones', 'widened diploe', 'Urinary mucopolysaccharides', 'PFD', 'able to start walking', 'distal hand muscle weakness', 'muscle power']",['methylprednisolone'],"['25', 'emergency room', 'ER']","['MRC scale', 'MRI of the spine', 'Skull X-rays', 'CT scans', 'blood examinations', 'blood glucose', 'serum calcium', 'phosphate', 'alkaline phosphate levels', 'thyroid function tests', 'Urinary mucopolysaccharides']","['since early childhood', 'three days', '5 days', '10th day']"

The patient's history revealed two family members (a mother and sister) with similar symptomology, resulting in a diagnosis of familial keloid syndrome. However, neither the mother nor sister was affected with perineal keloid development. Past medical history was also notable for arthritic symptoms and diabetes mellitus, which were present in both mother and sister. The index lesion was firm, pliable growth, 20 cm in its greatest diameter, adjacent to 10 cm and 6 cm perivulvar lesions, which caused the patient considerable discomfort and affected ambulation (Figure ). Physical examination revealed multiple other hypertrophic nodular growths on the posterior neck, behind the right ear, bilateral scapular regions, right flank and breast, abdomen and extremities in addition to the primary lesion. Past medical history evinced numerous heterogeneous treatments for various keloids in multiple loci; she had previously received surgical extirpation, steroid injections, and two episodes of radiotherapy to the back. Despite these interventions, her keloids have either recurred or persisted. Surgical extirpation of the largest perineal lesion was undertaken, and histopathologic examination was performed, denoting the classic keloid-associated features of haphazard collagen deposition, with nodular formations thickened hyalinized bands (Figure ).
On the day following surgical excision, the patient was treated with radiotherapy using photons at 6MV. The total dose delivered was 22 Gy in 11 days, with a daily fraction of 2 Gy. The dose fraction was split between two fields with an anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) port arrangement. Maximum acute Radiation Therapy Oncology Group skin toxicity score was Grade 3 (moderate ulceration and skin breakdown), which resolved after a 3-day treatment break.
At 6 months post-therapy, the lesion in question had not recurred (Figure ), and the patient reported no difficulty attributable to the lesion.
After 10 months after completion of radiation treatment for perineal keloids, the patient returned for additional treatment to her back and chest wall. Radiotherapy was delivered at 3 Gy/fraction with 9MeV electrons to her back, lateral back, and anteromedial back over 4 days.

On physical examination, she had a large painless mass arising from the right-sided parapharyngeal space causing severe airway narrowing with no cervical lymphadenopathy. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large contrast-enhanced mass arising from the right-sided parapharyngeal space causing airway obstruction and pressure effect on the major cervical vessels(Fig , ). Fine needle aspiration through cervical region was performed and reported as benign spindle cell tumor. The patient then underwent near total tumor resection. In less than 8 months after the completion of multi-modality therapy, she developed multiple lung metastases.
The FNA biopsy was performed using 25 gauge 1-inch needle attached to a disposable 20-mm syringe. Approximately one half of the smears were immediately wet-fixed with 95% ethyl alcohol for Papanicolaou and immunostaining. The remaining smears were air-dried and stained by Wright method.
Immunohistochemical stains were performed on prefixed unstained cytologic smears and paraffin embedded tissue by the standard avidin-biotin technique after a microwave citrate buffer antigen retrieval step. The panel of antibodies used included cytokeratin ([CK]AE1/AE3, 1:80; Dako Co.), S-100 protein (1:400; Dako), muscle specific actin (1:10; BioGenix, San Ramon, CA), desmin (1:100; Dako), actin (1:100; Dako), Vimentin (1:100;Dako), and epithelial membrane antigen ([EMA], 1:300; Dako).
Small and large clusters of cells with bland chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, oval to spindle-shaped cytoplasm with branching tumor tissue fragments(Fig. ), and vessel stalks were identified (Fig. ). Acinar structures scattered in between spindle cells with scant mucin background were also seen(Fig. ). Ovoid cells had short and long cytoplasmic processes; and finely granular chromatin and small or indistinct nuclei(Fig. ). Smears also showed a mixture of dispersed or clusters of spindle cells with bland chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and epitheloid cells which occasionally formed acinar structures(Fig. ). Immunocytochemical staining for CK showed focal positivity in the spindle cell component(Fig. ) and also positivity in epitheloid cells for EMA (Fig. ). Immunocytochemical staining for S100, actin and desmin were negative.
Grossly a fragile, spongy, nonencapsulated 4 × 3 × 2 cm mass was resected. Microscopic examination showed submucosal hypercellular tumoral tissue (Fig. ). On higher magnification the tumor had a biphasic pattern(Fig. ). Epithelial cells formed glands that contained eosinophilic secretions.

She stated that the pain evolved spontaneously and is continuous, often disturbing her from sleep. She also stated that she did not get much relief from routine analgesics. Emotionally she was very much depressed, as she had been evaluated by a number of general and oral physicians. But the diagnosis remained elusive. Her attending dental care provider had extracted few teeth, presumably on the assumption that the pain was of dental origin. However, there was no relief and hence she presented to us.
On extra oral examination no anomalies were detectable. Intra oral examination showed a brownish red discoloration, measuring 1 × 0.75 cm on the lingual aspect of the right retro molar region. The surface of the lesion was slightly elevated and irregular. There was no pain on palpation but it bleed. The lesion blanched on pressure but immediately refilled upon release. Based on the clinical appearance, a vascular lesion was high on the diagnostic considerations. Panoramic radiograph showed no significant finding. The lesion was excised with proper precautions. During excision the bleeding was little more than normal and continued for 15 minutes, but was arrested following pressure pack application. In the next few days following excision the patient reported that the pain had subsided considerably.
Routine microscopy showed predominantly entrapped ducts and effaced acini amid proliferating thin walled endothelium lined cavernous type of blood vessels (Fig & Fig &). In other fields, displacement of mucous salivary acini and ducts towards the surface epithelium was evident. The intervening connective tissue between the surface epithelium and the main body of the lesion lacked lesional tissue but showed survival of ducts and dense collagenization. (Fig ).

After performing vaginal culture, intravenous amoxicillin clavulanate and ritodrine were started. The contractions diminished, but fetal heart rate decelerations were still present. Caesarean section for suspected fetal distress was performed and a healthy boy of 1227 gram (5th–10th percentile) was born with 1 and 5-minute Apgar scores of 9 and 10, respectively.
Postoperatively, the woman continued to receive amoxicillin clavunalate – her temperature normalised and CRP dropped to 84 mg/L. On day 5 postpartum a spiking fever developed. Physical examination of the lungs, breasts and wound were not suspicious for infection. CRP rose to 321 mg/L and WBC was 27.5 × 10.9/L. Cultures taken from the vagina and throat, and urine and stool cultures were negative. Serologic tests for toxoplasmosis, syphilis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus were negative. On day 8 postpartum the woman had still a spiking fever and a raised CRP despite amoxicillin clavunalate. Abdominal ultrasound and X-ray of the thorax were normal. Amoxicillin clavunalate was discontinued. Nine days after delivery, the Pfannenstiel wound developed purulent discharge and a small peri-incisional erythema; the wound borders were closed. On day 11 postpartum a wound culture was indicative for staphylococcus aureus and flucloxacillin was started. Definite culture was negative and flucloxacillin was changed to oral clindamycin on day 17 postpartum. The wound was now more erythematous, had blue-red colored margins, was infiltrated and gaping at the corners. CRP was 85 mg/L and WBC 17.7 × 10.9/L. Standard conservative wound care was advised and the woman was discharged to home care 19 days after delivery. Twenty-three days after caesarean section, the woman was readmitted because of severe wound pain. CRP was 409 mg/l and WBC 34.1 × 10.9/L. Violaceous coloured wound borders were spread expanding the ulcerative defect progressively (Figure ). Histopathologic findings of the wound biopsy showed necrosis of the epidermis with edema and bulla and an intense infiltration of granulocytes in the dermis. There were no signs of vasculitis and immunofluorescence assay was negative for immune complex vasculitis.
The clinical features and histopathological findings made pyoderma gangrenosum highly probable. Prednisone 65 mg/day (1 mg/kg) was initiated. Paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tramadol were prescribed for pain relief. Because the wound defect did not stabilise, prednisone was increased to 100 mg/day orally. Wound borders were treated with tacrolimus 0.1 % cream. Standard wound care consisted of gel and cutarazine gaze. Within 48 hours the wound defect stabilised and CRP decreased. Wound culture was positive for pseudomonas aeruginosa and was treated with topical acetic acid 1%.
Twenty-three days after readmission and 46 days after caesarean section, the woman was discharged on prednisone 80 mg/day. Two months after delivery wound healing was incomplete and prednisone 40 mg was maintained till 6 months after delivery. At this time the wound was completely healed leaving a large ""parchment paper"" scar (Figure ). Prednisone was decreased by 5 mg a week and could be stopped almost 9 months after caesarean delivery.
Serum protein electrophoresis was normal, antiphospholipid, antinuclear and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and rheuma factor were negative. The woman's family history showed familial polyposis but colonoscopy indicated no abnormality.","[[32.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['cervical intraepithelial', 'bilateral breast', 'lower abdominal', 'throat', 'body', 'uterine', 'fundal', 'cervix', 'amniotic membranes', 'heart', 'uterine', 'vaginal', 'heart', 'lungs', 'breasts', 'vagina', 'throat', 'Abdominal', 'thorax', 'epidermis', 'dermis']","['pregnancy', 'gravida 1', 'para 0', 'cervical intraepithelial neoplasia', 'CIN II', 'wound', 'gestation', 'hypertension', 'lower abdominal pain', 'fever', 'flu like symptoms', 'headache', 'sore throat', 'uterine contractions', 'dilated', 'completely effaced', 'fetal growth', 'fifth percentile', 'oligohydramnios', 'late decelerations', 'uterine contractions', 'contractions', 'fetal heart rate decelerations', 'fetal distress', 'healthy boy', 'fever', 'wound', 'infection', 'toxoplasmosis', 'syphilis', 'rubella', 'cytomegalovirus', 'herpes simplex virus', 'fever', 'delivery', 'Pfannenstiel wound', 'purulent discharge', 'peri-incisional erythema', 'wound borders were closed', 'staphylococcus aureus', 'wound', 'delivery', 'wound pain', 'Violaceous coloured wound borders', 'ulcerative defect', 'necrosis of the epidermis', 'edema', 'bulla', 'infiltration of granulocytes', 'vasculitis', 'immune complex vasculitis', 'pyoderma gangrenosum', 'wound defect', 'Wound borders', 'wound defect', 'pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'delivery', 'wound', 'wound', 'parchment paper"" scar', 'familial polyposis', 'abnormality']","['amoxicillin clavulanate', 'ritodrine', 'amoxicillin clavunalate', 'amoxicillin clavunalate', 'Amoxicillin clavunalate', 'flucloxacillin', 'flucloxacillin', 'clindamycin', 'Prednisone', 'Paracetamol', 'tramadol', 'prednisone', 'tacrolimus', 'cutarazine gaze', 'acetic acid', 'prednisone', 'prednisone', 'Prednisone']","['32', 'antenatal outpatient clinic']","['loop excision', 'bilateral breast reduction', 'maximum diastolic blood pressure', 'Physical examination', 'body temperature', 'fundal height', 'Ultrasound', 'Fetal cardiotocogram', 'CTG', 'variable fetal heart rate', 'External tocodynamometry', 'Blood tests', 'white blood cell count', 'WBC', 'neutrophilia', 'C-reactive protein', 'CRP', 'vaginal culture', 'Caesarean section', 'Apgar scores', 'temperature', 'CRP', 'Physical examination', 'CRP', 'WBC', 'Cultures', 'urine and stool cultures', 'Serologic tests', 'CRP', 'Abdominal ultrasound', 'X-ray of the thorax', 'wound culture', 'Definite culture', 'CRP', 'WBC', 'Standard conservative wound care', 'home care', 'caesarean section', 'CRP', 'WBC', 'Histopathologic', 'wound biopsy', 'immunofluorescence assay', 'nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs', 'pain relief', 'Standard wound care', 'CRP', 'Wound culture', 'caesarean section', 'caesarean delivery', 'Serum protein', 'Serum protein electrophoresis', 'antiphospholipid', 'antinuclear and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies', 'rheuma factor', 'colonoscopy']","['2 years earlier', '13 years earlier', '18 weeks', '31 weeks', 'Two weeks before', 'Two weeks before', 'Two weeks before', 'Postoperatively', 'On day 5 postpartum', 'On day 8 postpartum', 'Nine days', 'Nine days after delivery', 'On day 11 postpartum', '19 days', 'Within 48 hours', 'Two months']"

She was maintained on tamoxifen for five years thereafter. In her routine annual follow-up at The JamesCare Breast Center of The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital, she reported feeling a new pea-sized palpable event in the inferolateral aspect of her right breast for only one-week duration.
On clinical breast examination, the patient was noted to have a well-healed periareolar, curvilinear scar along the superior aspect of her right breast from approximately the 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock axis. There were no associated palpable events within this region of her right breast representing the area of her previously treated breast cancer. However, within the mid to peripheral portion of the lower outer quadrant of her right breast in the 7 o'clock axis, the patient had a less than one centimeter suspicious palpable nodule that appeared to be relatively superficially located within the breast tissue.
Mammography (Figure and ) showed stable, asymmetrical, increased density to the tissue within the upper retroareolar portion of her right breast, consistent with her prior lumpectomy site. However, a new 0.8 × 0.5 cm mammographic density was noted in the inferolateral portion of her right breast. Targeted right breast ultrasound (Figure ) showed a 0.78 × 0.63 × 0.49 cm hypoechoic lesion that was located in the 7 o'clock axis and approximately 4 cm from the nipple, which was associated with acoustic shadowing. This was thought to be suspicious for malignancy and was classified as BI-RADS 4, for which a biopsy was recommended.
A minimally invasive right breast ultrasound-guided 8 gauge Mammotome® vacuum-assisted biopsy was performed. Microscopic evaluation revealed fragments of breast parenchyma in which a bland spindle cell proliferation was present, forming long interlacing fascicles (Figure ). The cells showed cigar-shaped nuclei with vesicular chromatin and pinpoint nucleoli that were dispersed amidst varying degrees of collagen deposition, ranging from scant to thick bundles (Figure ). In some fragments, the proliferation could be seen entrapping lobular units. Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin were negative.
The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room at to The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and underwent an ultrasound directed wide local excision of the inferior portion of her right breast in the 7 o'clock axis within the mid to peripheral breast field.
Gross pathologic evaluation of the specimen, which overall measured 7.5 × 4.5 × 4.0 cm in size, revealed a 0.8 × 0.7 × 0.4 cm gray-white firm mass abutting a 2.5 × 2.0 × 1.2 cm biopsy cavity (Figure ). Microscopic evaluation revealed residual fibromatosis. All surgical margins were negative. The residual fibromatosis came to within 0.6 cm of the overlying skin margin and was 1.1 cm from the closest parenchymal margin. No evidence of carcinoma was seen.

Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a 2 × 2.5 cm solid lesion in the left parotid gland. Cervical and peri-aortic lymph nodes were not enlarged, except for one in the submandibular region.
Total parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve was performed. Thus, the parotid gland and covering skin were removed. Lateral jugular lymph nodes dissection was carried out.
The lesion was initially examined in frozen sections. The specimen was submitted for histology and after fixation in formalin solution and inclusion in paraffin, 3–5 μm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for conventional evaluation and a Periodic acid Schiff stain also carried out. A panel of immunostains, including antibodies against mitochondrial antigen, keratin (Citok AE1, Citok AE3), carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA), vimentin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, smooth muscle actin and S-100, was applied to representative sections of the tumour using the avidin-biotin complex technique (Table ). Formalin-fixed small fragments of neoplasm were also examined by electron microscopy, after washing in 0,1 M phosphate buffer, postfixation in osmium tetroxide, dehydratation in ethanol and embedding in epon-araldite.

He had never taken mefloquine prophylaxis before this trip, but his childhood was remarkable for multiple episodes of malaria treated with various anti-malarial regimens. His previous psychiatric history was significant for a single panic attack experienced in his early twenties. He had no medical diagnoses prior to these events. He used no alcohol or other substances and had no known drug allergies.
Mr. A began his malaria prophylaxis regimen of once-a-week, 250 mg mefloquine two weeks prior to traveling to Nigeria. He and his wife spent a week in urban regions of his native country without incident. He discontinued his malaria prophylaxis upon returning to the United States. Two weeks later, Mr. A began experiencing fatigue and a mild headache and presented to a university-affiliated travel clinic. He denied fever, chills, night sweats, or nausea. Chemistries and cell blood count were within normal limits, and a blood smear showed no evidence of parasitaemia.
Two weeks after his visit to the travel clinic, Mr. A, still concerned that he might have malaria, took a one-time therapeutic dose of 1250 mg mefloquine. The next day, he began experiencing vertigo and insomnia, both which lasted for several days. While at work that same week, he experienced chest pain radiating down his left arm with concomitant diaphoresis and tachycardia in what the patient described as ""an ACS picture,"" referring to acute coronary syndrome. He felt intense anxiety at this time. Mr. A's blood pressure taken in his office was 210/110. He then went to the emergency department of an outside hospital and was admitted for a hypertensive emergency. Cardiac work-up for ACS, including an exercise stress test, was negative and head computerized tomography showed no abnormalities other than a left maxillary mucosal inclusion cyst suggestive of sinusitis. Mr. A was diagnosed with hypertension and, incidentally, with Type II diabetes mellitus. He was held overnight for observation and discharged the following morning on metoprolol 100 mg qd, lisinopril 10 mg qd, rosiglitazone 1 mg bid, and metformin 500 mg bid, and zolpidem 10 mg qhs. The following Monday morning, he returned to work at his office, but left midday because he was experiencing anxiety and nervousness. He did not return to work the rest of the week and tried to relieve his anxiety with exercise and outdoor activities. During this week, he began having unusual conversations about spirituality and religion with his wife. His wife reported that he had difficulty following conversations and was remarkably suspicious of her as well, with numerous inquiries into her activities and friends.
Nine days after the previous hospital discharge, Mr. A became abruptly anxious and agitated with delusions that his wife was having an extramarital affair and began ""talking out of his head."" His wife, fearful of his increasing agitation and paranoia, finally coaxed Mr. A into going to the emergency department at a university-affiliated hospital. He became severely agitated and paranoid in the emergency department, becoming highly suspicious of the one-to-one sitter ordered for his safety after he had reported suicidal ideation. He attempted to escape from the hospital. Eventually, Mr. A had to be restrained to his bed due to profound psychomotor agitation. His vital signs were remarkable for a blood pressure of 157/97, and physical examination was significant only for altered mental status. Serum electrolytes, renal function, and cell blood count were within normal limits. Blood glucose was mildly elevated at 146 mg/dL. Urine drug screen was negative. Urinalysis was positive for bacteriuria, and a course of levofloxacin was initiated. Mr. A was admitted to the general medicine service, where overnight he had another acute episode of agitation, becoming increasingly argumentative with the staff. Intramuscular haloperidol was administered to treat his acute psychotic agitation.
Mr. A was transferred to the medical psychiatry inpatient unit with the DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of Psychotic Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified. His vital signs remained stable. Rapid plasma reagin test, cobalamin and folate levels, liver transaminase levels, and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were within normal limits. Mr. A complained of intense anxiety with no identifiable precipitant on the first day of his hospital course. He demonstrated paranoid behaviour and was highly suspicious of the staff, frequently checking identification badges and quizzing the staff in order to verify their background and knowledge. Although generally cooperative, he questioned the utility of all procedures indicated in his treatment. He was started on quetiapine 25 mg qhs, alprazolam 0.5 mg bid and zolpidem 5 mg qhs. The latter two medicines were both started during his previous hospitalization for hypertensive crisis. He was also maintained on his previous anti-hypertensive (metoprolol 100 mg qd and lisinopril 10 mg qd) and diabetic (rosiglitazone 1 mg bid, and metformin 500 mg bid) regimens. An electroencephalogram was performed, and the results were negative and inconsistent with delirium or encephalopathy. His vital signs were stable and within normal limits.
The next day, he reported that he refused quetiapine the previous night (confirmed with the nursing staff), citing that his paranoia and delusions had resolved. His claims were incongruent with his behaviour, as he was even more inquisitive than previously, again challenging the staff on their medical knowledge and questioning the rationale behind his medical treatment. He requested that he see his medications delivered in their original packaging before taking them. He eventually took his psychotropic medications but refused diabetic management on grounds that he wanted a subspecialist to manage his diabetes. Work-up for pheochromocytoma, porphyria, and heavy metal toxicity was negative. Over the next couple days, Mr. A's paranoia remitted in response to low dose quetiapine, and he became more pleasant, agreeable, and less suspicious. He eventually agreed to the nursing staff dispensing all his medications and to routine management of his diabetes. On day six of admission, Mr. A stated that he felt more trusting and was completely agreeable to the treatment and discharge plan, although he still found it difficult to follow conversations. After confirming follow-up appointments with Mr. A and his wife and obtaining assurances that he would not return to work until after clearance by an outpatient psychiatrist, Mr. A was discharged on quetiapine 100 mg qhs, metoprolol 100 mg qd, lisinopril 10 mg qd, rosiglitazone 1 mg bid, and metformin 500 mg bid.","[[37.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['psychiatric', 'chest', 'left arm', 'coronary', 'Cardiac', 'head', 'left maxillary mucosal', 'head', 'renal', 'liver', 'thyroid']","['malaria', 'panic attack', 'medical diagnoses', 'used no alcohol or other substances', 'fatigue', 'headache', 'fever', 'chills', 'night sweats', 'nausea', 'parasitaemia', 'malaria', 'vertigo', 'insomnia', 'chest pain', 'pain', 'diaphoresis', 'tachycardia', 'ACS', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'anxiety', 'hypertensive emergency', 'ACS', 'abnormalities', 'left maxillary mucosal inclusion cyst', 'sinusitis', 'hypertension', 'diabetes mellitus', 'anxiety', 'nervousness', 'anxiety', 'difficulty following conversations', 'anxious', 'agitated', 'delusions', 'talking out of his head', 'agitation', 'paranoia', 'agitated', 'paranoid', 'suicidal ideation', 'restrained to his bed', 'psychomotor agitation', 'altered mental status', 'bacteriuria', 'agitation', 'argumentative', 'psychotic agitation', 'DSM-IV-TR', 'Psychotic Disorder', 'anxiety', 'identifiable precipitant', 'paranoid behaviour', 'cooperative', 'hypertensive crisis', 'diabetic', 'delirium', 'encephalopathy', 'paranoia', 'delusions', 'incongruent with his behaviour', 'inquisitive', 'diabetes', 'pheochromocytoma', 'porphyria', 'heavy metal toxicity', 'paranoia', 'pleasant', 'agreeable', 'suspicious', 'diabetes', 'trusting', 'difficult to follow conversations']","['mefloquine', 'mefloquine', 'metoprolol', 'lisinopril', 'rosiglitazone', 'metformin', 'zolpidem', 'levofloxacin', 'haloperidol', 'quetiapine', 'alprazolam', 'zolpidem', 'metoprolol', 'lisinopril', 'rosiglitazone', 'metformin', 'quetiapine', 'quetiapine', 'quetiapine', 'metoprolol', 'lisinopril', 'rosiglitazone', 'metformin']","['A', '37', 'United States', 'Nigeria', 'A', 'Nigeria', 'urban', 'United States', 'A', 'university-affiliated travel clinic', 'travel clinic', 'A', ""A's"", 'emergency department', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'emergency department', 'university-affiliated hospital', 'emergency department', 'A', 'A', 'general medicine service', 'A', 'medical psychiatry inpatient unit', 'A', ""A's"", 'A', 'A', 'A']","['mefloquine prophylaxis', 'anti-malarial regimens', 'malaria prophylaxis regimen', 'malaria prophylaxis', 'Chemistries', 'cell blood count', 'blood smear', 'blood pressure', 'Cardiac work-up', 'exercise stress test', 'head computerized tomography', 'exercise', 'outdoor activities', 'vital signs', 'blood pressure', 'physical examination', 'Serum electrolytes', 'renal function', 'cell blood count', 'Blood glucose', 'glucose', 'Urine drug screen', 'Urinalysis', 'vital signs', 'Rapid plasma reagin test', 'cobalamin', 'folate levels', 'liver transaminase levels', 'thyroid stimulating hormone levels', 'treatment', 'medicines', 'anti-hypertensive', 'electroencephalogram', 'vital signs', 'medical treatment', 'medications', 'psychotropic medications', 'diabetic management', 'Work-up', 'medications', 'routine management']","['Two weeks later', 'Two weeks later', 'next day', 'next day', 'several days', 'several days', 'at this time', 'overnight', 'next couple days']"

General and systemic examinations were within normal limits. Ophthalmologic examination revealed a right proptosis and conjunctival chemosis. Visual acuity was normal. A diffuse tender swelling was present in the right periorbital and temporal region.
Routine hematological investigations showed mild normocytic normochromic anemia (Hemoglobin-9.7 g %) and an elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) (124 mm/1st hour). Other parameters were within normal limits.
Routine biochemical investigations did not reveal any abnormality.
Contrast Enhanced Computerized Tomography (CECT) [Figure and ] and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) [Figure ] of head showed a lytic destructive lesion involving the right sphenoid bone, frontal bone and zygomatic arch. An associated soft tissue component was seen extending laterally into the infratemporal fossa and medially into the orbit.
Based on the clinico-radiological findings, diagnostic possibilities of a tubercular lesion, lymphoma and a sphenoid wing meningioma were considered.
FNAC from the diffuse swelling in the temporal region was performed using a 23 gauge needle attached to a 20 cc syringe. The aspirate was hemorrhagic. Smears fixed in 90% alcohol and air dried smears were stained by Papanicoloau technique, and Giemsa stain respectively.
Microscopic examination revealed hemorrhagic smears exhibiting single cells as well as groups of plasma cells having eccentrically placed nuclei with cartwheel chromatin pattern and basophilic cytoplasm with variable degree of paranuclear clearing [Figure ]. Few cells also showed cytoplasmic vacuoles and binucleation [Figure ]. A cytological diagnosis of plasmacytoma was thus given and further evaluation advised to rule out systemic involvement.
A detailed workup was performed. Test for urinary Bence-Jones proteins on a random urine sample was negative. Serum proteins showed a reversed albumin/globulin ratio (0.58). Serum calcium level (9.5 mg/dl) and renal function tests were normal. Serum beta-2 microglobulin was elevated (3788 μg/L; normal range 700–3400 μg/L).
Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypergammaglobulinemia and a monoclonal gammopathy (M spike) in the gamma globulin region (4.03 g/dL).
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy [Fig ] showed infiltration by groups and sheets of plasma cells comprising about 40% of marrow population.

These did not involve suicidality, aggressive behaviour, or other serious disturbance. All prior episodes had resolved within several weeks. In 1990 DS had had an episode of depression, which his doctor treated with fluoxetine. He had a clear adverse reaction to fluoxetine involving agitation, restlessness and possible hallucinations, which worsened over a three-week period despite treatment with trazodone and propranolol that might have been expected to minimise the severity of such a reaction. After fluoxetine was discontinued DS responded rapidly to imipramine.
In 1998, a new family doctor, unaware of this adverse reaction to fluoxetine, prescribed paroxetine 20 mg to DS, for what was diagnosed as an anxiety disorder. Two days later having had, it is believed, two doses of medication, DS using a gun put three bullets each through the heads of his wife, his daughter who was visiting, and his nine-month-old granddaughter before killing himself.
At jury trial in Wyoming in June 2001, instigated by DS' surviving son-in-law, a jury found that paroxetine “can cause some people to become homicidal and/or suicidal” []. SmithKline Beecham was deemed 80 percent responsible for the ensuing events []. The documentary evidence included an unpublished company study of incidents of serious aggression in 80 patients, 25 of which involved homicide.
Experts for the plaintiff suggested that the mechanism through which paroxetine contributed to these events was probably akathisia or psychosis. A central problem with both akathisia and psychosis in such contexts is that the takers of medications often fail to recognise the fact that the state they are in is drug-induced and that discontinuing treatment can alleviate the symptoms.","[[60.0, 'year']]",M,2006-09,[],"['anxiety/depressive', 'anxiety/depressive episodes', 'suicidality', 'aggressive behaviour', 'serious disturbance', 'depression', 'clear adverse reaction to fluoxetine', 'agitation', 'restlessness', 'hallucinations', 'reaction', 'responded rapidly', 'adverse reaction to fluoxetine', 'anxiety disorder', 'killing himself', 'homicidal', 'aggression', 'homicide', 'akathisia', 'psychosis', 'akathisia', 'psychosis', 'drug-induced', 'alleviate the symptoms']","['fluoxetine', 'fluoxetine', 'trazodone', 'propranolol', 'fluoxetine', 'imipramine', 'fluoxetine', 'paroxetine', 'paroxetine', 'paroxetine']","['60', '1990', '1998', 'jury trial', 'Wyoming', 'June 2001', 'jury', 'SmithKline Beecham']","['treatment', 'medication', 'study', 'medications', 'treatment']","['In 1990', 'over a three-week period', 'over a three-week period', 'over a three-week period', 'Two days later']"

He had no history of violence or suicidality, and had remained gainfully employed throughout.
During one of these episodes, DH was given sertraline (Zoloft) by a GP and clearly responded adversely to this, most notably with agitation. He stopped treatment the following day on medical advice. In July 1999, he sought help from his GP, who was on leave. DH was seen by a locum who admitted in Court that he had not checked DH's file before prescribing sertraline 50 mg. That night, apparently feeling worse after a first dose of sertraline, DH took four more doses of sertraline.
The next morning, after his wife got up he met her in the kitchen and strangled her. He then set off in his car, having decided to kill himself, but turned round and contacted the police to tell them what had happened. He decided he should accept the consequences of his actions and did not want to distress his family further.
DH's lawyers had intended to defend the case on the basis of non-insane automatism or involuntary intoxication, but before the proceedings in May 2001, the Crown made an offer that if DH pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment, the Crown Prosecutor would not contest any defence submission that DH be released from gaol on the date of his sentence. Further, the Crown accepted the case put forward by the defence implicating sertraline. DH accepted that offer in view of his age (78). The judge in his summing-up released DH and stated: “I am satisfied that but for the Zoloft he had taken he would not have strangled his wife” [].

In 2001 she approached her GP who prescribed paroxetine. An initial 20 mg dose was increased to 30 mg. MB appeared to become more anxious and agitated. This deterioration led to a switch to venlafaxine, which was successively increased to 300 mg/day. During these increases, the medical notes record her as being more anxious and agitated, but did not link this to treatment.
She made plans to take her own and her children's lives, and taking the children for a drive, attached a hosepipe to the exhaust. In the course of two efforts to execute this plan, she thought better of it and informed both the police and child-care authorities what had happened. Her children were taken into care and she was charged with attempted murder.
During the sentencing in the Supreme Court of Western Australia in April 2004, the judge stated there were substantial grounds for implicating venlafaxine in MB's behaviour, and gave her a suspended sentence [].

509,1564177-4,16968128,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1564177.xml,Antidepressants and Violence: Problems at the Interface of Medicine and Law,"According to an independent forensic report compiled a year after the events for which CP was charged in November 2001, CP was a 12-year-old, 5'2”, 95-lb boy with a family background involving considerable social dislocation. Despite the difficulties of his social situation, he had no record of treatment for nervous disorders or of violence or behavioural disturbance. Following an argument with his father at the end of October 2001, he was admitted to a behavioural centre for six days where he was started on paroxetine. His behaviour worsened daily on paroxetine. He was discharged against medical advice to the care of his grandparents, who, when his paroxetine ran out, took him to their primary-care physician who prescribed sertraline 50 mg, increasing this to 100 mg two days before the killings for which CP was charged. The duration of sertraline treatment was three weeks.
After the prescription of sertraline, CP was involved in a number of aggressive incidents at school, the first on record for him, and was reported by family members and church members to be restless and talking unusually volubly. Relatives noted a series of risky behaviours. On the day of the killings, his grandparents had told him that he could not take the school bus following an episode of aggression toward one of the other children on the bus. Later that evening he attended choir practice with his grandparents, who in response to escalating difficulties had warned him he might have to be returned to his father.
The independent forensic report on the case notes CP as saying that that night: “something told me to shoot them”. He had initially reported this to be hallucinations and then said he thought it was his own thoughts. When asked to specifically describe what the experience was like, he said it was “like echoes in my head saying ‘kill, kill’, like someone shouting in a cave”. According to the forensic report, “He reported this began happening after he went to bed…He reported he had never considered harming his grandparents before and this was unlike anything he had previously experienced. He reported that the voices were coming from inside his head and they bothered him so much that he got up. He reported that the voices continued until he killed his grandparents. He reported that he couldn't control himself and reported the echoes stopped after he shot his grandparents. He set fire to the house but could not explain these actions saying the thoughts just popped up”. He then took a vehicle and began driving but reported that he had no idea where he was going and that it all felt like a dream. He recalled asking the police about his grandparents after he was picked up because he was not sure if it had really happened or not.
These events and CP's overall behaviour and history led an independent forensic child psychiatrist to diagnose substance-induced mania and psychotic disorder. The charges of double murder and arson were heard by jury trial in an adult rather than juvenile court. In the process of jury selection, 32 of 75 prospective jurors declared that they or someone related to them were on or had been on an antidepressant. Court TV covered the trial in its entirety. Both prosecution and defence from the outset accepted that CP had shot his grandparents. Media coverage focused heavily on the question of “‘Evil’ or ‘chemically compelled’?”
In February 2005, after a two-week trial, a jury found CP guilty of murder and he was sentenced to 30 years in prison []. Questioned by the media afterwards, “Steven Platt, a 26-year-old accounting clerk for an electrical supply wholesaler, said the group believed that Christopher exhibited side effects from Zoloft but did not feel it was severe enough to let him escape criminal responsibility” []. Summing up some of the points at issue, the judge Daniel Pieper stated: “There is no case in South Carolina that addresses involuntary intoxication by prescription drugs…It seems to turn the whole medical system on its side if you can't rely on the medication your doctor prescribes. It could potentially force you into a situation of lifetime commitment if that drug induces an effect of which you're not aware… There's something disconcerting about that, albeit probably something of a legal nature that is troubling me” [].

510,1564184-1,16846514,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1564184.xml,Gemcitabine in combination with EGF-Receptor antibody (Cetuximab) as a treatment of cholangiocarcinoma: a case report,"A 69 Year old male presented to our clinic with abdominal discomfort, nausea and a weight loss of 18 kg within four months. The overall performance status was significantly reduced (Karnofsky-Index: 70%). A palpable spleen and tenderness of the right lower abdominal quadrant were found during physical examination, whereas no other relevant pathological findings were evident. Initial computed tomography of the abdomen and thorax revealed a hepatic mass and was indicative for peritoneal carcinomatosis. The tumor was located adjacent to the gallbladder and administration of oral contrast medium before computed tomography did not show any luminal tumor of the intestine. Without evidence for intra or extra-hepatic cholestasis, laboratory findings during first clinical presentation showed inflammatory changes (c-reactive protein: 345 mg/l, normal range < 5 mg/l) and elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase serum-levels (5-fold). These findings were suggestive for tumor-associated cholangitis and were treated with wide spectrum intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam).
Subsequent diagnostic mini-laparoscopy as well as hepatic and peritoneal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a CC and proved associated peritoneal carcinomatosis. Therefore, no curative resection was applicable due to extensive tumor disease. Histology from the peritoneal and hepatic biopsy showed an intermediately differentiated adenocarcinoma. As the immune-histochemical staining has been negative for CK20 and intensively positive for CK7, a carcinoma from gastrointestinal origin was excluded [,]. Spin cytology from aspirated ascites showed coherent findings. Finally, a subsequent analysis for EGFR expression confirmed a weak (1+) tissue staining. After histological diagnosis, the initiation of chemotherapy was delayed, as the subsequent clinical course was complicated by obstipation and protracted bowel obstruction-like symptoms, which finally resolved under laxative therapy.
Medical history was remarkable for an insulin dependant diabetes mellitus (type 2) for twenty years, associated diabetic nephropathy and polyneuropathy. Adipositas (BMI: 34.8) and hyperuricaemia completed the pre-existing metabolic syndrome. Essential arterial hypertension and absolute arrhythmia, secondary to atrial flutter, showed an uncomplicated clinical course under medical treatment. The patient received amlodipine, ramiprile and torasemide as antihypertensive treatment. Digitoxin and phenprocoumon was administered for heart rate control and embolic prophylaxis, respectively. Facing the extensive CC, phenprocoumon was discontinued and switched to a therapeutical dose of fractionated low molecular heparin. Insulin (10 IU/day), pravastatin and allopurinol were further co-medications at time of first admission. An analgesic therapy became mandatory, due to tumor-associated pain. Analgesics were titrated to 75 mcg/h fentanyl via a trans-dermal application system (SMAT) and oral metamizol (3 g/day) in combination with amitryptiline (25 mg/day), which led to sufficient pain control. Finally, a subclavian port device was implanted to facilitate supportive parenteral nutrition (1500 kcal/day) facing severe tumor-associated anorexia.
Following informed consent, an experimental chemotherapy based on gemcitabine and anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab) was initiated within the fourth week (25th day) after first clinical presentation. Chemotherapy was administered via central venous catheter. The initiated schedule comprised applications of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 bodysurface) every other week. The combination with cetuximab, starting with a loading dose of 400 mg/m2 and followed by a weekly maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2 bodysurface, was initiated together with the fourth gemcitabine cycle after financial approval for its experimental use. The patient received 20 cycles of chemotherapy for 42 weeks (i.e. 9.7 months) during the reported time period of 10.7 months since first presentation. The cumulative dose of gemcitabine reached 31.0 g/m2 bodysurface and 14.9 g/m2 bodysurface for cetuximab during the reported period.
Haematological toxicities were the most relevant gemcitabine-related side effects observed during chemotherapy, leading to severe leukopenia (CTC, grade 3), neutropenia (CTC, grade 2) and thrombocytopenia (CTC, grade 3). The haematological events required treatment with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim, 300 mcg/day) and transfusion of platelet concentrates, respectively. The patient was hospitalized to manage resulting neutropenic fever (CTC, grade 3) with intravenous antibiotics. Each documented episode of neutropenic fever was promoted by Staphylococcus epiderdimis sepsis, initiated by recurrent catheter-related infections. Thus, the revision of the infected port system abolished further recurrent catheter sepsis. Anorexia (CTC, grade 3), nausea (CTC, grade 3), alopecia (CTC, grade 1) and fatigue (CTC, grade 1) were other documented gemcitabine-related side effects. Toxicities caused by cetuximab were restricted to mild rosacea (CTC, grade 1) of the head and neck region. Other dermatological toxicities due to cetuximab did not develop during treatment. Severe complications under chemotherapy required hospitalization for 5.3 weeks (37 days), during which complete chemotherapy was paused. The second episode of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia has led to a prolonged dose reduction (50 percent) of gemcitabine for three subsequent cycles.
After nine cycles of chemotherapy abdominal CT-imaging showed a partial response, according to RECIST criteria. The hepatic target lesion showed a reduction in diameter of more than 30%. Additional hypervascularized non-target lesions, depicted in the hepatic arterial contrast phase, were no longer detectable after administration of the initial chemotherapy cycles. Peritoneal enhancement, representing peritoneal carcinomatosis, vanished completely after initiation of therapy. (Figure and ) Concordant with the radiological observations Ca 19-9 levels, which were elevated more than fivefold, returned to normal after 16 weeks of treatment. (Figure ) During subsequent radiological follow up, tumor remission was persisting, showing ongoing stable disease for additional 26 weeks of treatment.
Most importantly, the clinical status (Karnofsky-Index: 70–80%) stabilized during chemotherapy and did not show any worsening until the end of follow up. Whereas the first three cycles of gemcitabine did not affect overall performance status significantly, tumor-associated anorexia improved after six cycles of combined gemcitabine and cetuximab. Therefore supplemental alimentation was discontinued, which was administered within the first four months after diagnosis. Also the initial analgesic dose of 75 mcg/h transdermal fentanyl could be reduced by 30% to 50 mcg/h.","[[69.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['abdominal', 'spleen', 'right lower abdominal quadrant', 'abdomen', 'thorax', 'hepatic', 'peritoneal', 'gallbladder', 'luminal', 'intestine', 'intra or extra-hepatic', 'hepatic', 'peritoneal', 'peritoneal', 'peritoneal', 'hepatic', 'gastrointestinal origin', 'tissue', 'bowel', 'arterial', 'atrial', 'heart', 'head', 'neck region', 'abdominal', 'hepatic', 'hepatic arterial', 'Peritoneal', 'peritoneal']","['abdominal discomfort', 'nausea', 'weight loss', 'overall performance status was significantly reduced', 'palpable spleen', 'tenderness of the right lower abdominal quadrant', 'pathological findings', 'hepatic mass', 'peritoneal carcinomatosis', 'tumor', 'luminal tumor of the intestine', 'intra or extra-hepatic cholestasis', 'inflammatory changes', 'tumor-associated cholangitis', 'CC', 'peritoneal carcinomatosis', 'tumor disease', 'adenocarcinoma', 'CK20', 'CK7', 'carcinoma', 'aspirated ascites', 'coherent findings', 'tissue staining', 'obstipation', 'bowel obstruction-like symptoms', 'insulin dependant diabetes mellitus', 'diabetic nephropathy', 'polyneuropathy', 'Adipositas', 'hyperuricaemia', 'metabolic syndrome', 'Essential arterial hypertension', 'absolute arrhythmia', 'atrial flutter', 'CC', 'tumor-associated pain', 'tumor-associated anorexia', 'Haematological toxicities', 'gemcitabine-related side effects', 'leukopenia', 'CTC', 'neutropenia', 'CTC', 'thrombocytopenia', 'CTC', 'haematological events', 'neutropenic fever', 'CTC', 'neutropenic fever', 'Staphylococcus epiderdimis sepsis', 'catheter-related infections', 'infected port system', 'catheter sepsis', 'Anorexia', 'CTC', 'nausea', 'CTC', 'alopecia', 'CTC', 'fatigue', 'CTC', 'gemcitabine-related side effects', 'side effects', 'Toxicities', 'rosacea', 'CTC', 'dermatological toxicities', 'complications', 'leukopenia', 'partial response', 'hepatic target lesion', 'reduction in diameter', 'lesions', 'Peritoneal enhancement', 'peritoneal carcinomatosis', 'tumor remission', 'stable disease', 'worsening', 'tumor-associated anorexia']","['piperacillin/tazobactam', 'amlodipine', 'ramiprile', 'torasemide', 'Digitoxin', 'phenprocoumon', 'phenprocoumon', 'fractionated low molecular heparin', 'Insulin', 'pravastatin', 'allopurinol', 'fentanyl', 'metamizol', 'amitryptiline', 'gemcitabine', 'cetuximab', 'gemcitabine', 'cetuximab', 'gemcitabine', 'gemcitabine', 'cetuximab', 'gemcitabine-related', 'filgrastim', 'gemcitabine-related', 'cetuximab', 'cetuximab', 'gemcitabine', 'gemcitabine', 'gemcitabine', 'cetuximab', 'fentanyl']","['69', '25th']","['Karnofsky-Index', 'physical examination', 'computed tomography of the abdomen and thorax', 'computed tomography', 'laboratory', 'c-reactive protein', '-glutamyl transpeptidase serum', '-glutamyl transpeptidase serum-levels', 'antibiotics', 'mini-laparoscopy', 'hepatic and peritoneal biopsy', 'biopsy', 'curative resection', 'Histology', 'peritoneal and hepatic biopsy', 'immune-histochemical staining', 'Spin cytology', 'EGFR expression', 'histological diagnosis', 'chemotherapy', 'laxative therapy', 'BMI', 'medical treatment', 'antihypertensive treatment', 'heart rate control', 'embolic prophylaxis', 'co-medications', 'analgesic therapy', 'Analgesics', 'pain control', 'subclavian port device was implanted', 'supportive parenteral nutrition', 'chemotherapy', 'anti-EGFR antibody', 'Chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor', 'transfusion of platelet concentrates', 'platelet concentrates', 'antibiotics', 'revision of the infected port system', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'abdominal CT-imaging', 'chemotherapy cycles', 'therapy', 'Ca 19-9 levels', 'treatment', 'radiological', 'treatment', 'Karnofsky-Index', 'chemotherapy', 'supplemental alimentation', 'analgesic']","['four months', 'twenty years']"

Left endoscopic antrotomy was performed. The sinus proved to be filled with polypous, chronically inflamed mucous membrane.

According to her given expected date of confinement, she was 35 weeks and four days of gestation. On admission, she had no history of medical disorders or trauma. Generally, she was very pale, conscious, agitated, hypotensive and with severe tachycardia (Pulse 120/bpm; BP 90/50 mmHg, Temp 37.5°C). Abdominally, marked tenderness and rigidity all over the abdomen was found, fetal heart sounds showed severe bradycardia 100/bpm. Vaginal examination revealed no bleeding and the cervix was closed, firm and posterior. Laboratory studies, included a complete blood cell count, chemistry, coagulation profile, and arterial blood gases, were undertaken. In view of her clinical presentation, as BP was decreasing and the pulse was increasing, the provisional diagnosis was query placental abruption or rupture uterus. Rapid infusion of 2 L of crystalloid was started. Cesarean section was done immediately, there was no signs of placental abruption as the placenta was upper, posterior and fully attached to the uterine wall. She gave birth of a baby boy (2.2 Kg), Apgar score (1,6,8), admitted to the NICO. After closure of the uterus, the pelvis and abdomen were explored. A huge retroperitoneal haematoma was found extending behind the descending colon. The general and vascular surgeons were called, they advised conservative treatment as the haematoma was neither expanding nor pulsating. The abdomen was closed and 2 intra-peritoneal drains were left. During the operation she received 4 units FFP, 2 units blood 4 units of packed cells and remained haemodynamically stable. The patient was kept in recovery room for close monitoring. Within one hour BP dropped again to 100/60 mm Hg, pulse increased to 110/bpm, blood was coming from the drains and the patient was deteriorating. Both surgeons were called again for re-assessment; they decided to re-explore the abdomen. The retroperitoneal haematoma was found to be expanded via the left paracolic gutter, the posterior peritoneum over the haematoma was opened. A voluminous retroperitoneal haematoma (about 3000 ml blood and clot), due to an undiagnosed totally avulsed left kidney, was found. There was severe bleeding from the hilar vessels. The bleeding vessels were clamped and the urologist was called and shared the operating team. A decision of nephrectomy was taken, after a committee, as the left kidney was severely damaged and as a life saving procedure. The urologist tried to feel the other kidney but he failed because of the extensive haematoma. During re-exploration she received, 6 units packed cells, 6 units FFP and IV fluids. After closure of the abdomen the patient was found to be anuric. The urologist preferred to do cystoscopic examination versus right ureteric catheterization but he failed to visualize the right ureteric orifice. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound was done at the theatre and failed to visualize the right kidney. The patient was transferred to ICU, anuric, under sedation on ventilator. She stayed anuric for 2 days in the ICU, after that she was transferred to the postoperative ward. Her postpartum recovery was uneventful apart from progressively increasing kidney function tests. CT was done in the second postoperative day and confirmed the absence of right kidney. She was discharged after 10 days from admission and a haemodialysis twice sitting per week was scheduled for her. The patient now is waiting for compatible kidney transplant. Histopathological report revealed degenerative aneurysmal changes of the renal artery and acute tubular necrosis of the left kidney.","[[40.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['abdominal', 'Abdominally', 'abdomen', 'heart', 'Vaginal', 'cervix', 'arterial', 'placental', 'uterus', 'placental', 'placenta', 'uterine wall', 'uterus', 'pelvis', 'abdomen', 'retroperitoneal', 'descending colon', 'abdomen', 'intra-peritoneal', 'abdomen', 'retroperitoneal', 'left paracolic gutter', 'retroperitoneal', 'left kidney', 'hilar vessels', 'bleeding vessels', 'left kidney', 'kidney', 'abdomen', 'right ureteric', 'right ureteric orifice', 'Abdominal', 'pelvic', 'right kidney', 'right kidney', 'kidney', 'renal artery', 'tubular', 'left kidney', 'kidney']","['gravida 10', 'para 9', 'ill', 'abdominal pain', 'gestation', 'medical disorders', 'trauma', 'pale', 'conscious', 'agitated', 'hypotensive', 'tachycardia', 'tenderness', 'rigidity', 'bradycardia', 'bleeding', 'closed', 'firm', 'placental abruption', 'rupture uterus', 'placental abruption', 'fully attached to the uterine wall', 'gave birth of a baby boy', 'retroperitoneal haematoma', 'haematoma', 'intra-peritoneal drains were left', 'haemodynamically stable', 'blood was coming from the drains', 'deteriorating', 'retroperitoneal haematoma', 'retroperitoneal haematoma', 'blood', 'clot', 'avulsed left kidney', 'bleeding', 'damaged', 'haematoma', 'anuric', 'anuric', 'anuric', 'postpartum recovery was uneventful', 'absence of right kidney', 'degenerative aneurysmal changes of the renal artery', 'tubular necrosis of the left kidney']",['fluids'],"['40', 'emergency room', 'recovery room', 'ICU', 'ICU', 'postoperative ward']","['Pulse', 'BP', 'Temp', 'fetal heart sounds', 'Laboratory studies', 'complete blood cell count', 'chemistry', 'coagulation profile', 'arterial blood gases', 'BP', 'pulse', 'Rapid infusion', 'Cesarean section', 'Apgar score', 'closure of the uterus, the pelvis and abdomen were explored', 'conservative treatment', 'abdomen was closed', 'FFP', 'blood', 'packed cells', 'BP', 'pulse', 're-explore the abdomen', 'posterior peritoneum over the haematoma was opened', 'bleeding vessels were clamped', 'nephrectomy', 'procedure', 're-exploration', 'packed cells', 'FFP', 'closure of the abdomen', 'cystoscopic examination', 'right ureteric catheterization', 'Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound', 'sedation', 'ventilator', 'kidney function tests', 'CT', 'haemodialysis', 'kidney transplant', 'Histopathological']","['since 1 hour', '35 weeks and four days', 'four days', '2 days']"
513,1569821-1,16953890,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1569821.xml,Extensive myocardial infiltration by hemopoietic precursors in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome,"A 64-year-old woman with increased lethargy, generalized weakness, and shortness of breath on exertion was found to have pancytopenia on a routine blood count; hemoglobin 80 g/L, white blood cells 3.2 × 109/L, platelets 98 × 109/L. After bone marrow examination a diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) was made. The symptoms were attributed to anemia and she received 5 units of packed red cells.
Approximately 2 months later, she developed a 4-day course of intermittent chills and sweating but was afebrile when she came to the local emergency department. The CBC at admission demonstrated 6.9 × 109/L white blood cells with left shift and 0.21 × 109/L blasts, 76 g/L hemoglobin and 65 × 109/L platelets. During her hospital stay the white blood cells increased to 16.9 × 109/L with increasing left shift; anemia and thrombocytopenia persisted. There was central bronchial wall thickening and interstitial prominence in the chest radiograph suggestive of an early viral infectious process. The cardiomediastinal silhouette was within normal limits (Figure ). The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was started on oral levofloxacin.
Four days later, the patient became febrile (38.8 degrees) and developed increasing shortness of breath and retrosternal chest pain that radiated to both arms. There were bilateral crepitations and decreased breath sounds. Repeat chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, basal consolidation of the left lower lobe and left ventricular enlargement. There was no evidence of cardiac failure (Figure ). Right bundle branch block (RBBB) with sinus tachycardia was identified on ECG. An echocardiographic study identified a moderate pericardial effusion with no cardiac tamponade; the left ventricular ejection fraction was 66% and there were no regional wall motion abnormalities. The next day, a repeat echocardiographic study identified a 33% ejection fraction with left ventricular global hypokinesia and a moderate sized pericardial effusion without tamponade. The patient was treated for pneumonia, hypotension, acute renal failure, and anemia but developed heart block and cardiorespiratory compromise. Her condition deteriorated rapidly and she died five days post-admission.
Peripheral blood and bone marrow, ante-mortem (Figures , , , ): In the peripheral blood there was dysplasia in the leukocytes (pseudo Pelger-Huet cells and hypogranular neutrophils), platelets (hypogranular platelets and large platelets) and red cells (macrocytic red cells and dimorphic red cells) was associated with a left shift and circulating blasts. The bone marrow was hypercellular with trilineage dysplasia (pseudo Pelger-Huet cells, erythroid precursors with nuclear bridging, irregular nuclear contours, irregular hemoglobinization of the cytoplasm and mononuclear and multinucleated megakaryocytes). There was abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP) in the core biopsy. The bone marrow aspirate differential count (table ) showed increased blasts (18.2%) while the erythroid precursors were less than 50% of the nucleated cells.
Post-mortem examination was limited to heart and lungs at the request of the family. The heart lay free in the pericardial sac, surrounded by 300 mL of straw-colored pericardial effusion. There was fibrinous pericarditis. The free wall of the left ventricle and the interventricular septum had soft and hemorrhagic areas scattered throughout, with no definite transmural focus. The major coronary arteries (right coronary, left anterior descending, and left circumflex arteries) were involved to only a minor degree by old eccentric atherosclerotic plaques (maximum stenosis of 25 to 30%) with no evidence of an acute event (thromboembolus, hemorrhage, rupture). There was bilateral pulmonary edema and left lower lobe congestion and consolidation.
Microscopic examination of the heart (Figures , , , ) revealed a diffuse interstitial infiltrate of immature dysplastic hemopoietic cells involving the myocardium, endocardium and the pericardium. Cells of myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages were present. These infiltrates were associated with single fibre myocyte necrosis as well as larger foci of necrosis. A majority of these cells were immunopositive for myeloperoxidase consisted with myeloid lineage.
Pancytopenia associated with peripheral blood features including dysplastic changes in the granulocytes, <1% blasts and < 1 × 109/L monocytes coupled with multilineage dysplasia and 18.2% blasts in the bone marrow was in keeping with the diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 (RAEB-2) []. Clinical presentation and clinical course of RAEB is typically related to the symptoms of decreased counts of one or more cell lineages and blast count [,]. The symptoms of lethargy, shortness of breath, and generalized weakness in this patient may be attributed to both anemia and cardiac infiltration by malignant cells, although the former is much more common clinically []. Her cardiac symptoms were not due to drugs sometimes used in patients with myelodysplasia, since the patient had not received cytotoxic, immunomodulatory, putative differentiating agent, or hemopoietic growth factor therapy [-].
Although cardiac involvement in leukemic extramedullary spread is relatively common (ranging from 37–44%) [-], clinical signs are found in less than 1% of cases [-] and leukemic cardiac involvement antemortem is usually not suspected []. The most likely reason for this is the subclinical nature of the symptoms and signs in cardiac leukemic infiltration []. This is in keeping with the observation that gross infiltrative disease at the time of initial diagnosis in patients with acute leukemia is rare [,,]. In the patient reported here extramedullary (cardiac) infiltration by dysplastic hemopoietic precursors by itself is not a reason to upgrade the diagnosis to acute leukemia. Extramedullary infiltration at other sites has been reported in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes [,], more frequently in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia compared to RAEB and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia [,]. Although it may herald transformation to acute leukemia [], this transformation may not be observed for some time [,] and sometimes not at all during follow-up [,]. Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor overproduction may lead to autonomous colony formation in the bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome []; this may partially explain proliferation of malignant hemopoietic cells in the heart infiltrated by malignant cells.
Although cardiac infiltration is usually associated with high WBC count (mostly due to blasts) and advanced disease [], the presence of a high circulating white blood cell count is not a necessity for developing cardiac infiltration as infiltration has been shown to be present in aleukemic leukemia [] as well as in patients with very low white cell counts []. The development of cardiac infiltration in our patient with myelodysplasia and pancytopenia would be consistent with this observation keeping with this pheneomenon; the rising white late in the course of the disease was was predominantly due to neutrophilia and left shift and not due to a large blast population.
The effects of hemopoietic cell infiltrate in the heart are varied. Leukemic deposits may form mass lesions [] or thrombi []. Pericardial involvement may lead to pericardial effusion contributing to restrictive myocardial dysfunction [,]. Reports of heart block in extramedullary cardiac leukemic involvement are few [,,]. Heart block has been observed in patients with both very high and very low peripheral blood white cell counts [] and may be reversible after local radiotherapy to the heart despite persistence of leukemic infiltration []. However, infiltration of the conduction system is a potentially serious complication that may be fatal []. Leukemic infiltration is a rare cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy []. An antemortem study of 18 patients with acute leukemia (6 ALL, 12 AML) demonstrated no significant difference from controls in LV systolic function parameters including LV ejection fraction, similar to what was observed in our patient at initial echocardiography []. However, LV diastolic dysfunction has been observed in 38 percent of leukemic patients, independent of age and heart rate. It is likely that cardiac compromise in our patient was due to a combination of restrictive cardiomyopathy due to leukemic infiltration, concomitant anemia, cardiac dilatation, conduction blocks and myocardial necrosis. Myocardial necrosis was most likely due to a combination of, a) ischemic damage secondary to anemia and prolonged hypotension and b) extensive leukemic infiltration. Markedly rapid decrease in ejection fraction from 66% to 33% also suggests the role of ischemia, since leukemic infiltration is not expected to cause this degree of systolic dysfunction over a 24-hour period.
Usual causes of death in patients with myelodysplasia are related to bone marrow failure and transformation to acute leukemia [,,], however, in this patient, death was attributed to cardiac failure. It is likely that the rising white blood cell count during second admission, although predominantly due to neutrophilia and left shift, was associated with early transformation- in view of increased peripheral blood blast percentage – the limited autopsy did not permit evaluation of the bone marrow.
Cardiac involvement in by malignant hemopoietic cells is of more than just academic interest, since cardiac function has been shown to improve following therapy directed against malignant infiltrate [,]. Incorrect diagnosis during life and the fatal outcome highlight the clinical importance of considering myocardial infiltration in patients with myelodysplasia and cardiac symptoms.","[[64.0,

Laboratory investigation revealed iron-deficiency anaemia, with low haemoglobin (Hb) concentration (7.8 g/dl; normal range: 13–17 g/dL), median cellular volume (MCV) level (67.2 fl; normal range: 80–97 fl) and serum ferritin concentration (3.3 ng/mL; normal range: 30–400 ng/dL). Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 and alphafoetoprotein (AFP) were within normal limits. Stool guaiac was positive for occult blood. Colonoscopy demonstrated an exophytic mass in the ascending colon and multiple diverticula in the entire colon, especially in the sigmoid region. Endoscopic biopsies were performed and at histological examination, adenocarcinoma was diagnosed. Chest x-ray was negative for metastatic disease. A week later a right hemicolectomy and regional lymph node dissection were performed. During surgery, liver metastases were detected. Computer tomography (CT) scan carried out after surgery identified 3 liver nodules in segment 4, in segment 8 and in segment 5, measuring 15 cm, 10 cm and 10 cm in their greatest dimension, respectively. The patient was subsequently treated with capecitabine at 1250 mg/m2 orally twice a day for 14 days repeated every 28 days for 8 cycles. Capecitabine was chosen for adjuvant therapy in this case since it has been reported to be as effective as 5-fluorouracil but with milder side effects in stage III colon cancer []. No specific chemotherapeutic agents have been shown to be effective in carcinosarcoma []. Two years after surgical treatment, the patient is alive with liver metastases.
Representative sections of the tumour and all lymph nodes isolated from the surrounding adipose tissue were fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin, embedded in paraffin and routinely processed. From each block, 5 μm-thick sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
For immunohistochemical studies, the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method was used with the following antibodies: cytokeratin 20 (CK20), desmin, vimentin, S-100, c-kit, CD34, sarcomeric actin, smooth muscle actin, osteonectin. The antibodies used are detailed in Table .
For ultrastructural examination, small samples were retrieved from paraffin-embedded material, deparaffinised in xylene, rehydrated in ethanol, post-fixed in osmium tetroxyde (OsO4), dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were counterstained in uranile acetate and lead citrate and observed in a Jeol JEM 1010 (Tokyo, Japan) electron microscope operating at 80 kV.
For the molecular detection of somatic genetic alterations, the p53 gene (exons 4 through 9), the c-kit gene (exons 9, 11, 13 and 17) and the EGFR gene (kinase domain, exons 18 through 21) were evaluated by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) technique (The WAVE™ Nucleic Acid Fragment Analysis System, Transgenomic Inc., Nebraska, USA), followed by direct sequencing when required. K-Ras gene mutation status was assessed by direct sequencing. Distinct formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material from both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components of the tumour was isolated by macrodissection. Genomic DNA was extracted by the phenol-chloroform method. Fifty ng of DNA were used for the specific amplification of all the exons listed above, as previously described [-]. After the polymerization reaction, all PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) products were visualised on a 2% agarose gel; 10 μl of the PCR product were denatured at 95°C and slowly cooled to room temperature to ensure equimolar homo- and heteroduplexes formation prior being loaded for DHPLC analysis. The running methods used are listed in Table . All samples that showed an elution profile different from a wild type control underwent direct sequencing by BigDye® Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit chemistry, purified by DyeEx 2.0 Spin kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and analysed by capillary electrophoresis on Abi Prism 310 (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, California, USA). Sequences obtained were aligned with normal sequences and examined for detection of mutations. For allelic status testing, 10 microsatellite markers on chromosomal arms 9p, 11p, 13q, 17q and 18q were investigated (Rb, D9S171, D11S1336, D13S258, D13S317, D13S631, D17S855, D18S35, D18S51 and D18S585). Specific PCRs with fluorescent primers were conducted followed by loss of heterozygosis (LOH) analysis with GeneScan software (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, California, USA).
The surgical specimen included a 4 cm long ileal segment, a 13.5 cm long colonic segment, and the caecal appendix. At the ileocaecal valve, on the colonic side, an exophytic, centrally ulcerated mass, measuring 7 cm in its greatest dimension, was documented. Twenty-two lymph nodes were isolated from the adipose tissue surrounding the bowel wall.
Microscopically, about 70% of the tumour displayed features of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, invading the subserosa (pT3). The carcinoma was composed of neoplastic epithelial cells, arranged in nests forming glandular structures with areas of central necrosis. Neoplastic epithelial cells exhibited rare mitotic figures, an increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and prominent nucleoli. Approximately 30% of the tumour presented mesenchymal features. The sarcomatous component was completely separated from its carcinomatous counterpart by fibrous septae (Fig. ). In the sarcomatous component, fascicular spindle cells admixed with bizarre large cells and focal osteoid-like matrix deposition were found. Fascicular spindle cells showed a moderately eosinophilic cytoplasm, with slightly enlarged nuclei. Large cells were markedly pleomorphic and exhibited enormously swollen nuclei with irregularly dispersed chromatin, focally surrounding areas of osteoid material deposition in the extracellular matrix. Metastasis of adenocarcinoma (N1) was found in 1 out of 22 lymph nodes detected. According to the TNM classification [], the pathological stage was pT3N1.
The epithelial component was immunoreactive for CK20 in approximately 30% of neoplastic cells, whereas it was negative for vimentin and osteonectin. In the mesenchymal component, spindle cells were diffusely immunoreactive for smooth muscle actin (Fig. ) and partially positive for vimentin, while large cells were focally immunoreactive for osteonectin (Fig. ). Both the epithelial component and the mesenchymal component were negative for S100, desmin, CD34, c-kit and sarcomeric actin.
Ultrastructural examination was performed on both epithelial and mesenchymal areas of differentiation. Epithelial cells were organised in glandular structures encircled by basal membrane and showed typical surface microvilla and basal hemidesmosomes (Fig. ). Spindle cells exhibited myofibroblastic differentiation with peripheral cytoplasmic thin filaments and interspersed focal densities (Fig. ). There was no admixture of the two components.
The molecular screening performed to detect mutations revealed in both tumour components the same mutation R282W in exon 8 of the p53 gene (Figs. , ). No mutation was found in the k-ras gene. Although no mutations could be detected, identical polymorphisms were identified in the carcinomatous as well as in the sarcomatous components in p53 exon 4, in EGFR exons 20 and 21, and in c-kit exon 17. The microsatellite analysis evidenced shared allelic retentions and loss among the epithelial and the mesenchymal neoplastic counteparts. Of the 10 STRs (Short Tandem Repeats) investigated, 7 were considered informative and four of them displayed an identical pattern comparing normal and the two tumoral components. An almost complete loss of the second allele was appreciated for D18S585, D18S35 and D18S51 markers (18q21) in both tumor' parts (Fig. ).
Carcinosarcoma is widely considered a rare, highly aggressive tumour. Carcinosarcoma of the colon was first reported by Weidner et al in 1986 [] and to the best of our knowledge, cases of colon carcinosarcomas and sarcomatoid carcinomas reported in literature are 17 [,][-][-][-][-][-], summarised in Table . Affected patients show an age between 41 and 84 years, with a median age of 66 years and a slight predilection for women. Lymph nodes and distant sites metastases disclose a predominance of the carcinomatous component. Shah et al reported even an increased epithelial component in the spleen metastasis, comparing with the primary colon site []. Only one case with a metastasis from the sarcomatous component was documented [].
Herein we report a carcinosarcoma with distinct epithelial and mesenchymal components, at the morphological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural levels. Moreover, the sarcomatous component was composed of cells reminiscent of smooth muscle differentiation and cells with osteoblastic appearance. Some authors classified as large bowel carcinosarcomas epithelial tumours with areas of sarcomatoid differentiation, weakly immunoreactive for cytokeratins and with no evidence of osteosarcomatous nor chondrosarcomatous differentation [,,,]. According to Aramendi et al., these cases are not properly carcinosarcomas, but should be considered sarcomatoid poorly differentiated carcinomas []. In the present case, the sarcomatous component completely lacked any epithelial signs of differentiation; furthermore, we noted areas of osteosarcomatous differentiation and osteoid material deposition. The topographic distribution was remarkable for the complete separation of the two components. Ultrastructural examination confirmed such distinct separation. Bertram et al. instead reported intermixed epithelial and mesenchymal components []. Other authors have classified as carcinosarcomas or sarcomatoid carcinomas tumours with sarcomatous features immunoreactive for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), but lacking carcinomatous component [,,]. Shoji highlights the difficulty in making the correct diagnosis, since sarcomatous component closely resembles sarcoma, except for cytokeratin-immunoreactivity [].
Treatment, as underlined by Bertram et al., should follow guidelines for common colon adenocarcinomas [] and the poor prognosis associated with this tumour should require a strict follow-up. Remarkably, the patient reported here is still alive, two years after surgical resection of the primary tumour, despite the presence of liver metastases. Therefore we believe that aggressive therapy may be indicated in these tumours.
The histogenesis of carcinosarcoma is still controversial. Morphologically, the presence of distinct carcinomatous and sarcomatous components suggests a different origin (multiclonal hypothesis). The molecular analysis performed in the current case supports the hypothesis of a common cell precursor (monoclonal hypothesis), since the same mutation R282W in exon 8 of the p53 gene as well as the same allelic status, with the loss of 18q21, were identified in both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components.
Studies conducted on carcinosarcomas of nasopharynx [], uterus [,] and breast [], documented a large overlap of cytogenetic and molecular alterations in the two tumour components. Furthermore, Van Rees et al. [] described an uncommon case of adenosquamous carcinoma raised in a Barrett esophagus where the two malignant components showed loss of the same allele at all informative chromosomal markers tested as well as the same missense mutation in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene. All these findings are consistent with our results suggesting the hypothesis of a common progenitor of both epithelial and mesenchymal components. Therefore morphological divergence, even at the extreme levels displayed by carcinosarcomas, necessarily appears late in tumor progression, well after the initial hits that cause cancer.","[[81.0,

Clinically it measured 15 mm. She was treated with conservative breast surgery and level III axillary node clearance. Tumor margins were clear and all lymph nodes were negative. Tamoxifen was commenced at 20 mg OD.
A course of postoperative radiotherapy was arranged due to breast conservation surgery. She received 46 Gy in 23 fractions over 35 days using paired glancing megavoltage fields. This treatment was completed in July 1996 and was followed by a boost to the site of excision of a further 12 Gy in 4 fractions over 7 days using 9MEV electrons. Chemotherapy was discussed but the patient did not want to pursue this option.
She remained in regular follow up with no evidence of local or regional recurrence. In June 2005 during a routine follow up appointment she reported a 2 cm area of purple skin lesion at the lower inner quadrant of the left breast (figure ), with a history of it being there for about 3 months. It was associated with peau d'orange and soft tissue thickening extending from the lower inner quadrant across the midline. Mammography was not performed, as she was too tender. Ultrasound showed no evidence of a lesion deep to the abnormality. Freehand core biopsies were taken of the area. Pathology demonstrated the presence of malignancy in keeping with high-grade angiosarcoma.
Staging investigations including CT chest and abdomen, CXR and bone scan none showed any evidence of metastasis. She had wide surgical excision and reconstruction with a Vertical Rectus Abdominus Myocutaneous flap (VRAM flap). She has completed her first year follow up without any recurrence.
Histological examination following routine processing and staining with haemotoxylin and eosin shows malignant tumor (figure ). Although this tumor is predominantly solid, comprising highly pleomorphic cells (figure ) and areas with spindle cell morphology (figure ) neoplastic vascular channels are also identified (figure ). Immunohistochemical staining for CD31, CD34 and factor viii confirm endothelial differentiation both within the solid tumor component and the recognizable vascular channels. The possible differential diagnoses of carcinoma and malignant melanoma are excluded by the negativity of other stains (MNF and S100 respectively). The histological features are those of high grade angiosarcoma.
Histology from the original breast excision biopsy (figure ) shows a lobular carcinoma, with strong oestrogen receptor positivity. This shows no similarity to the newly arising angiosarcoma.","[[78.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['lobular', 'upper outer part of the left breast', 'breast', 'axillary node', 'Tumor margins', 'lymph nodes', 'breast', 'site of excision', 'skin', 'lower inner quadrant of the left breast', ""peau d'orange"", 'soft tissue', 'lower inner quadrant across the midline', 'chest', 'abdomen', 'bone', 'vascular channels', 'solid tumor component', 'vascular channels', 'breast', 'lobular']","['lobular carcinoma', 'Tumor margins were clear', 'lymph nodes were negative', 'negative', 'local or regional recurrence', 'skin lesion', 'soft tissue thickening', 'too tender', 'lesion', 'lesion deep to the abnormality', 'malignancy', 'angiosarcoma', 'metastasis', 'recurrence', 'malignant tumor', 'tumor', 'areas with spindle cell morphology', 'neoplastic vascular channels', 'endothelial differentiation', 'carcinoma', 'malignant melanoma', 'angiosarcoma', 'lobular carcinoma', 'oestrogen receptor positivity', 'angiosarcoma']",['Tamoxifen'],"['April 1996', '78', 'July 1996', 'June 2005']","['conservative breast surgery', 'level III axillary node clearance', 'radiotherapy', 'breast conservation surgery', 'treatment', 'boost to the site of excision', 'Chemotherapy', 'Mammography', 'Ultrasound', 'Freehand core biopsies', 'Pathology', 'CT chest and abdomen', 'CXR', 'bone scan', 'wide surgical excision and reconstruction with a Vertical Rectus Abdominus Myocutaneous flap (VRAM flap)', 'Histological examination', 'staining with haemotoxylin and eosin', 'Immunohistochemical staining', 'Immunohistochemical staining for CD31, CD34 and factor viii', 'stains', 'MNF', 'S100', 'Histology', 'breast excision biopsy']","['postoperative', 'July 1996']"
516,1570363-1,16948834,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1570363.xml,Genital tuberculosis in a tamoxifen-treated postmenopausal woman with breast cancer and bloody vaginal discharge,"A 61-year-old postmenopausal woman diagnosed in the past with breast cancer presented to her Oncologist for regular follow up. The patient complained of fatigue, weight loss, persistent slight evening pyrexia, a mild lower abdominal pain for the last two months, along with leukorrhea and bloody vaginal discharge for the last three weeks. Five years ago, during the perimenopausal period, she was diagnosed with an infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast. She underwent lumpectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since then she was receiving oral tamoxifen that she was due to stop in one month and had no clinical, laboratory or radiological evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease.
Physical examination revealed mild abdominal distension and an enlarged, tense, and tender uterus. A chest radiograph was negative, while a full blood count, serum electrolytes, and liver function tests were normal. A transvaginal ultrasonogram showed an enlarged uterus with a 7 mm endometrial thickness (normal for age up to 4 mm). Hysteroscopy and endometrial aspiration biopsy performed because of the suspicion of a second primary cancer of the endometrium from the tamoxifen therapy disclosed necrotic debris with an extensive granulomatous reaction, numerous tubercles composed of epithelioid cells, and multinucleated giant cells with no central necrosis. These findings raised the suspicion of FGTB. Hence, samples from the endocervix and the endometrium were obtained with the use of a sterile Cyto Brush for PAP smear, suspended in sterile water, and processed according to standard guidelines [] followed by cultures in solid (Lowenstein-Jensen, BioMerieux, France) and liquid media (BacT/Alert 3D, Organon Teknika, NC). Although acid-fast staining was negative, the liquid culture gave a positive signal after 7 days of incubation. The presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was verified by AccuProbe assay (Gen-Probe, CA) and phenotypic-biochemical analysis. Since the samples submitted for culture from the endocervix and the endometrium were not separated, it is unclear if TB was limited to the endocervix, the endometrium or both.
Tuberculin skin testing was positive (>15 mm), while detailed family history revealed that the patient's mother and sister had died 30 and 10 years ago from TB. The patient had taken close care of both. No other family members had symptoms suspicious of TB. Interestingly, the patient had refused this family history at presentation to her Oncologist. Finally, she admitted the contact history to patients infected with TB only after the results of the cultures were available. In order to rule out pulmonary and renal spread of the disease, imaging and laboratory evaluation with chest radiograph and examination of multiple early morning sputum and urine samples with acid-fast staining and cultures was performed and showed no lung or renal involvement.
Drug susceptibility testing was performed by the proportional methods on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. The isolated strain was resistant to pyrazinamide (200 μg/ml), streptomycin (4 μg/ml), ethionamide (30 μg/ml), rifampicin (20 μg/ml) and pefloxacine (25 μg/ml) and susceptible to isoniazid (0.2 μg/ml), rifampicin (40 μg/ml), ethambutol (2 μg/ml), streptomycin (10 μg/ml) and para-4-aminosalicylic acid (0.5 μg/ml). The patient was treated with a three-drug regimen of isoniazid (300 mg/day), rifampicin (600 mg/day) and ethambutol (1500 mg/day) for nine months. Within a month after the beginning of antituberculosis therapy, the vaginal discharge disappeared along with resolution of the fatigue, a two kilogram weight gain, and complete resolution of the persistent evening pyrexia and the lower abdominal pain.","[[61.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['breast', 'lower abdominal', 'vaginal', 'ductal', 'breast', 'abdominal', 'uterus', 'chest', 'liver', 'transvaginal', 'uterus', 'endometrial', 'endometrial', 'endometrium', 'endocervix', 'endometrium', 'endocervix', 'endometrium', 'endocervix', 'endometrium', 'skin', 'pulmonary', 'renal', 'chest', 'lung', 'renal', 'vaginal', 'lower abdominal']","['postmenopausal', 'breast cancer', 'fatigue', 'weight loss', 'evening pyrexia', 'lower abdominal pain', 'leukorrhea', 'bloody vaginal discharge', 'perimenopausal period', 'infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast', 'metastatic disease', 'abdominal distension', 'enlarged', 'tense', 'tender', 'tender uterus', 'enlarged uterus', 'endometrial thickness', 'primary cancer of the endometrium', 'necrotic debris', 'granulomatous reaction', 'tubercles composed of epithelioid cells', 'multinucleated giant cells', 'central necrosis', 'FGTB', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'TB', 'died', 'TB.', 'symptoms', 'TB.', 'TB', 'spread of the disease', 'involvement', 'vaginal discharge', 'fatigue', 'weight gain', 'evening pyrexia', 'pyrexia', 'lower abdominal pain']","['tamoxifen', 'tamoxifen', 'pyrazinamide', 'streptomycin', 'ethionamide', 'rifampicin', 'pefloxacine', 'isoniazid', 'rifampicin', 'ethambutol', 'streptomycin', 'para-4-aminosalicylic acid', 'isoniazid', 'rifampicin', 'ethambutol']","['61', 'Jensen', '30', '10', 'Jensen']","['lumpectomy', 'adjuvant chemotherapy', 'radiotherapy', 'Physical examination', 'chest radiograph', 'full blood count', 'serum electrolytes', 'liver function tests', 'transvaginal ultrasonogram', 'Hysteroscopy', 'Hysteroscopy', 'endometrial aspiration biopsy', 'cultures', 'acid-fast staining', 'liquid culture', 'AccuProbe assay', 'Gen-Probe', 'CA', 'phenotypic-biochemical analysis', 'culture', 'Tuberculin skin testing', 'cultures', 'imaging', 'laboratory', 'chest radiograph', 'examination', 'sputum', 'urine samples', 'acid-fast staining', 'cultures', 'Drug susceptibility testing', 'three-drug regimen', 'antituberculosis therapy']","['evening', 'last two months', 'last three weeks', 'last three weeks', 'Five years ago', 'one month', '30 and 10 years ago', '10 years ago', 'evening', 'evening']"

The complaints had started one year before with a right sided feeling of pressure in the oral cavity and the neck. In 1966, 38 years before the patient presented to our department, he had been treated for a squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil in the territory of the former Soviet Union. At that time, the then 13-year-old boy underwent radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy with a cumulative radiation dose of 101 Gray. Although the patient was only 13 years old at the time when the diagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil was made, the presented documents left no doubt about the initial histological diagnosis. When the 51-year-old patient presented to our department in 2004, the otorhinolaryngological examination showed a smooth bounded neoformation in the region of the right-sided tonsillar fossa and soft palate with a diameter of about 2.5 cm (Fig. ). The tumor's palpation was dense. Computed tomography (CT) of the oropharynx confirmed the neoformation to be smooth bounded and well separated from the surrounding tissue (Fig. ). Computed tomography and ultrasonic examination of the neck did not reveal enlarged cervical lymph nodes that might have indicated lymphogenic metastatic spread. No indication for hematogenous metastatic spread was found on plain x-rays of the chest, ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen and positron emission tomography imaging studies.
An endoscopic examination of the larynx and hypopharynx was performed in general anesthesia and revealed these regions to be without pathological findings. Tumor-resection was then carried out by a transoral approach in combination with a mapping of the oropharyngeal mucous membrane. Histological examination of the tumor revealed spindle cells with marked polymorphism implicating a storiform growthpattern (Fig. ). Via immunohistochemistry focal expression of α-actin and S100 could be detected (Fig. ). The proliferation-index was high (70 %) (Fig. ). Upon these morphologic and immunohistochemical findings a leiomosacroma of the oropharynx was diagnosed. The tumor was completely removed by surgical resection and histological examination revealed the resection margins to be free of tumor cells. Two months postoperatively an endoscopic control-investigation with biopsy collection was carried out for evaluation of microscopic tumor relapse. Histological examination revealed marginal tumor-extension in the region of the left-sided soft palate. Re-operation was carried out by laser-surgery of the left-sided soft palate and histological examination revealed no tumor-remnants to be left in situ. The course of disease and treatment was then supervised by clinical and radiological follow-up control-investigations at regular 3 months intervals. Unfortunately, a biopsy taken from the middle of the soft palate in June 2005 again revealed microscopic signs of tumor-relapse. At that time the patient was free of symptoms and did not show a clinical correlate of tumor-recurrence. Surgical resection of these findings had to be performed two more times and histological investigations finally revealed an R0-resection status. Up to now, the patient did not undergo chemotherapy or radiotherapy of the radiogenic-induced leiomyosarcoma. Close clinical follow-up control-examinations with biopsies of the former tumor region will now be performed. In case of new tumor-relapse radical surgical resection and defect reconstruction by a free radial forearm flap will be the treatment of choice.","[[51.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['oropharyngeal', 'right tonsillar region', 'oral cavity', 'neck', 'left tonsil', 'radical', 'left tonsil', 'region of the right-sided tonsillar fossa', 'right-sided tonsillar fossa', 'soft palate', 'oropharynx', 'surrounding tissue', 'neck', 'cervical lymph nodes', 'chest', 'abdomen', 'larynx', 'hypopharynx', 'oropharyngeal mucous membrane', 'spindle cells', 'oropharynx', 'region of the left-sided soft palate', 'left-sided soft palate', 'left in situ', 'middle of the soft palate', 'former tumor region', 'radial forearm']","['oropharyngeal pain of the right tonsillar region', 'right sided feeling of pressure', 'squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil', 'squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil', 'bounded neoformation', ""tumor's palpation"", 'neoformation', 'enlarged cervical lymph nodes', 'lymphogenic metastatic spread', 'hematogenous metastatic spread', 'pathological findings', 'Tumor', 'tumor', 'polymorphism', 'storiform growthpattern', 'leiomosacroma of the oropharynx', 'resection margins to be free of tumor cells', 'tumor', 'tumor cells', 'microscopic tumor relapse', 'marginal tumor', 'tumor-remnants', 'disease', 'microscopic signs of tumor', 'symptoms', 'tumor', 'R0-resection status', 'radiogenic-induced leiomyosarcoma', 'leiomyosarcoma', 'tumor']",[],"['March 2004', '51', ""outpatient's department"", '1966', '13', '13', '51', '2004', 'June 2005']","['radical surgery', 'adjuvant radiotherapy', 'histological', 'otorhinolaryngological examination', 'Computed tomography (CT) of the oropharynx', 'Computed tomography', 'ultrasonic examination of the neck', 'plain x-rays of the chest', 'ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen', 'positron emission tomography imaging studies', 'endoscopic examination of the larynx and hypopharynx', 'general anesthesia', 'Tumor-resection', 'Histological examination', 'Histological examination of the tumor', 'proliferation-index', 'morphologic', 'immunohistochemical', 'tumor was completely removed by surgical resection', 'histological examination', 'endoscopic control-investigation', 'biopsy collection', 'Histological examination', 'Re-operation', 'laser-surgery of the left-sided soft palate', 'histological examination', 'treatment', 'biopsy', 'Surgical resection', 'histological', 'chemotherapy', 'radiotherapy', 'examinations', 'biopsies of the former tumor region', 'radical surgical resection', 'defect reconstruction by a free radial forearm flap']","['one year before', '38 years before', 'At that time', 'Two months', 'Two months', 'postoperatively', 'postoperatively', 'June 2005', 'At that time']"

The patients history revealed, that she had previously been treated several times for odynophagia with cervical tumescence within the last two month. Symptoms and swelling disappeared temporally after the antibiotic treatments. However, the cervical mass rapidly reappeared after the end of the treatment. Otolaryngological examination showed no particularity, beside a firm lateral cervical mass. A cervical CT scan (Fig ) revealed a deep subcutaneous collection, suggesting the presence of an cervical abscess. Potential infectious origins such as the tonsils, the salivary glands, teeth or the facial skin were calm. Despite an intravenous antibiotic treatment with decrease of the cervical mass, an ultrasound control 10 days later showed a persistent subcutaneous liquid collection. We then opted for incision and drainage of this collection. The drainage and cleaning of the abscess cavity unearthed a blade of grass within the purulent discharge (Fig ).

She had mild essential hypertension well controlled on diltiazem, did not smoke, and had no other medical complaint. She reported intermittent oral use of aspirin, 81 mg/d. In 1966, she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy ""when both ovaries were removed"". At the time of our evaluation, the patient used supplemental estrogen occasionally but was uncertain when this commenced. Her only other surgery was an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed in 1996.
The patient's BMI was 26. Vital signs and physical exam were normal although a heme positive stool was noted. Abdominal CT showed no significant abnormality, although pelvic CT revealed a 7 cm partially calcified mass at the upper pelvic inlet, indistinguishable from bowel [Figure ]. Ultrasound of this lesion confirmed a 74 × 45 × 49 mm heterogeneous (partially echogenic) mass in the upper right pelvis.
Serum electrolytes were unremarkable except for BUN and Cr at 20 mg/dl and 1.1 mg/dl, respectively. Hemoglobin was 11.8 g/dl. Serum hCG, CEA, and CA-125 were all normal.
A 12 mm umbilical port was placed along with two accessory ports (both 5 mm caliber), one each at the left upper and lower quadrants. Extensive abdominal adhesions were encountered and lysed with blunt dissection and harmonic scalpel. Eventually an approximately 7 cm smooth, white glistening mass could be seen in the right aspect of the pelvis [Figure ]. The mass was attached laterally to the right pelvic sidewall; these connections were secured with 10 mm endosurgical clips and then divided to free the tumor. Survey of abdomen and pelvis revealed no other gross abnormality. Estimated blood loss was ~50 ml and the patient was discharged home the same afternoon in excellent condition.
Formalin-fixed tumor sections embedded in paraffin were exposed to 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0), followed by incubation with 1:50 dilution of monoclonal mouse anti-vimentin (M0725, DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA, USA) using 20 min heat-induced epitope retrieval in DakoCytomation Target Retrieval solution (S3308) × 30 min incubation at room temperature with primary antibody.

520,1570479-1,16961927,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1570479.xml,Immunohistochemical analysis of an ectopic endometriosis in the uterine round ligament,"A 24-year-old female presented a thumb-sized subcutaneous tumor mass in the right side of the pubic region for two years. Because she felt that the tumor size and the pain were gradually increasing, she consulted us for medical care. She had never been pregnant or experienced dysmenorrhea.
Manipulation in the right groin region showed that the mass was located just above the right edge of the pubic tubercle and was a 2 × 3 cm subcutaneous tumor with a slightly rough surface, unclear borderline, and mild tenderness. While no adhesion to the skin and only slight adhesion to the subcutaneous fat tissue were observed, the tumor was firmly attached to the floor without mobility. No remarkable skin region was observed. The laboratory data showed no signs of inflammation with WBC 6400/μl and CRP 0.1 and only slight anemia with Hb 11.8 g/dl. Image analysis of a pelvic CT revealed an irregular subcutaneous mass just above the right edge of the pubic tubercle with the same X-ray absorbance density as that of the muscle. The radiographic diagnosis was that of an inflammatory tumor. Consequently, as the preoperative diagnosis, we considered an inflammatory reaction of a lymph node or a dermoid cyst.
During the operation, we easily approached the mass through an incision on the medial side of the right groin region. The mass could be manually released from its adhesion to the subcutaneous fat tissue, but was firmly attached to the uterine round ligament with a poorly demarcated borderline. Therefore, we removed the tumor with a part of the uterine round ligament attached. Neither an inguinal hernia nor a sac was observed. From the macroscopic view, fat tissue was attached to the surface of the tumor. The cross section presented a whitish-yellow color with an irregular round shape; the indistinct boundary adhered to the surrounding fat tissue. Small spots containing brownish mucus were observed. The H&E staining of the removed tissue showed several small hollow glands scattered inside the tumor with a stromal structure. The hollow glands were lined with columnar epithelial layers and surrounded by proliferated stromal cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that antibodies against CA125 (Fig. ), estrogen receptor (Fig. ), progesterone receptor (Fig. ), CD10 (Fig. ), and COX-2 (Fig. ) stained positively, but no staining of the CA19-9 antibody was observed. Although five antibodies that we chose had positive staining in the endometrial tissue, there were several differences in the degree of stainability among them. The CA125 antibody stained weakly, mainly in the inner and outer surfaces of the cytoplasm in the glandular endothelial cells, without staining the nuclei of the endothelial and stromal cells. The estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and COX-2 antibodies stained both in the stromal and endothelial cells. However, estrogen and progesterone receptor antibodies stained positively only in the nucleus and not the cytoplasm. The estrogen receptor antibody stained more positively in the endothelial cells than in the stromal cells, while the progesterone receptor antibody stained strongly and more positively in the stromal cells than in that of the endothelial cells. COX-2 had stained stronger in the cytoplasm and the nuclei of the endothelial cells than in that of the stromal cells. CD10 stained strongly positive in only the cytoplasm of the stromal cells. These findings indicated that the tumor that had adhered to the uterine round ligament had originated from the endometrial tissue.
After the operation, we consulted an obstetrician and a gynecologist. Neither uterine adenomyosis nor pelvic endometriosis was detected using manipulation, ultrasound examination, and MRI scan. The serum CA125 level was 19.9 U/ml, which is within the normal range. No recurrence of the tumor was observed one year after the operation.","[[24.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['subcutaneous', 'right side of the pubic region', 'right groin', 'right groin region', 'right edge of the pubic tubercle', 'subcutaneous', 'skin', 'subcutaneous fat tissue', 'skin region', 'pelvic', 'subcutaneous', 'right edge of the pubic tubercle', 'muscle', 'lymph node', 'medial side of the right groin region', 'adhesion to the subcutaneous fat tissue', 'uterine round ligament', 'inguinal', 'tissue', 'surface of the tumor', 'tissue', 'hollow glands', 'inside the tumor', 'stromal structure', 'hollow glands', 'columnar', 'endometrial tissue', 'glandular endothelial cells', 'nuclei of the endothelial and stromal cells', 'endothelial', 'stromal cells', 'estrogen receptor', 'progesterone receptor', 'stromal', 'endothelial cells', 'nucleus', 'cytoplasm', 'endothelial cells', 'stromal cells', 'stromal cells', 'endothelial cells', 'cytoplasm', 'nuclei of the endothelial cells', 'stromal cells', 'cytoplasm of the stromal cells', 'uterine round ligament', 'endometrial tissue', 'uterine', 'pelvic']","['subcutaneous tumor mass', 'tumor size', 'pain', 'pregnant', 'dysmenorrhea', 'Manipulation', 'mass', 'subcutaneous tumor', 'tenderness', 'adhesion', 'adhesion', 'tumor', 'mobility', 'remarkable skin region', 'inflammation', 'anemia', 'subcutaneous mass', 'inflammatory tumor', 'inflammatory reaction of a lymph node', 'dermoid cyst', 'mass', 'mass', 'tumor', 'inguinal hernia', 'sac', 'fat tissue', 'tumor', 'whitish-yellow color', 'irregular round shape', 'brownish mucus', 'hollow glands scattered inside the tumor', 'stromal structure', 'hollow glands were lined with columnar epithelial layers', 'proliferated stromal cells', 'staining of the CA19-9 antibody', 'positive staining', 'degree of stainability', 'cytoplasm', 'staining', 'tumor', 'uterine adenomyosis', 'pelvic endometriosis', 'tumor']",[],['24'],"['medical care', 'Manipulation in the right groin region', 'laboratory data', 'WBC', 'CRP', 'Hb', 'pelvic CT', 'X-ray', 'radiographic', 'mass through an incision on the medial side of the right groin region', 'mass could be manually released from its adhesion to the subcutaneous fat tissue, but was firmly attached to the uterine round ligament with a poorly demarcated borderline', 'removed the tumor', 'removed the tumor with a part of the uterine round ligament attached', 'cross section', 'H&E staining of the removed tissue', 'Immunohistochemical', 'antibodies against CA125', 'estrogen receptor', 'progesterone receptor', 'CD10', 'COX-2', 'antibodies', 'CA125 antibody', 'estrogen receptor', 'progesterone receptor', 'COX-2 antibodies', 'estrogen and progesterone receptor antibodies', 'estrogen receptor antibody', 'progesterone receptor antibody', 'COX-2', 'CD10', 'operation', 'ultrasound examination', 'MRI scan', 'serum CA125 level']","['two years', 'preoperative', 'preoperative', 'one year after the operation']"
521,1574295-1,16953883,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1574295.xml,Excessive weight gain after remission of depression in a schizophrenic patient treated with risperidone: case report,"A Caucasian 33-year-old married woman had recurrent delusions of persecution for a period of four years. Diagnosis of schizophrenia was established according to DSM-IV-TR. The severity of her psychotic symptoms was assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Family history was negative for schizophrenia and affective disorder, as well as for obesity and diabetes mellitus. At the beginning of treatment (BPRS score = 62) 6 mg/day of risperidone and 15 mg/day of clorazepate were administered; her body mass index (BMI) at the time was 29.4 (height 165 cm, weight 80 kg, baseline prolactin level = 4.5 ng/ml). After five weeks of risperidone treatment prolactin level was 18.1 ng/ml.
At the end of the first year a significant improvement in her psychotic symptoms was observed (BPRS score = 29; prolactin level = 16.1 ng/ml), but also a modest weight gain (5 kg, BMI reached 31.2). During the second year, she was fired from her job, spent more time at home and developed depressive symptomatology; 40 mg/day of fluoxetine was gradually added to her treatment regimen for about 9 months. During this time, she gained another 3 kg (BMI = 32.3; prolactin level = 13.4 ng/ml). After the remission of depression, fluoxetine was discontinued and she experienced carbohydrate cravings and ""binge eating"" episodes, especially during the evening. In the middle of the third year of treatment, although risperidone was gradually reduced to 2 mg/day without signs of relapse (BPRS score = 27), a dramatic increase in body weight was observed (weight 140 kg, BMI = 51.5; prolactin level = 10.7 ng/ml). All the attempts she made to reduce her weight by consulting a dietician failed. Since it was after the remission of depressive symptomatology and the discontinuation of fluoxetine that she began gaining excessive weight, fluoxetine (20 mg/day) was re-administered for few weeks but without any reduction in weight gain. This suggests that fluoxetine is not related to the patient's weight gain.
Six months later, she developed polydipsia and polyuria. Diabetes was diagnosed (her fasting blood glucose level was 170 mg/dl); thus 1700 mg/day metformin hydrochloride (an oral hypoglycaemic agent []) was prescribed, and after one month fasting blood glucose level was stabilized within the normal range. At the same time, in collaboration with an endocrinologist, 360 mg/day orlistat- a lipase inhibitor [] – was administered. Her body weight was reduced to 120 kg (BMI = 44.1; prolactin level = 8.7 ng/ml) within a period of six months. During the fourth year of treatment, she was hospitalized for a six-week period in an attempt to promote further weight loss. On admission, it was decided to add 200 mg/day topiramate to her regimen, since it has been reported that topiramate is an anticonvulsant with mood stabilizing and weight loss properties []. This helped her to lose a further 10 kg in a six-month period (BMI = 40.4; prolactin levels = 7.2 ng/ml).
The patient never had any abnormalities regarding thyroid function or her menstrual cycle (the levels of reproductive hormones were within normal range) during the four years of treatment. Prolactin levels were not elevated throughout the treatment with risperidone (range of prolactin levels in our patient under risperidone treatment: 7.2–18.1 ng/ml, normal prolactin levels: 2.5–26.5 ng/ml).

He was asymptomatic until the fall of 1999 when he started complaining of recurrent small bowel obstruction and weight loss. He had undergone multiple investigations and was thought to have underlying Crohn's disease. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of his abdomen in January 2000 demonstrated a large abdominal mass. A laparoscopy was performed for tissue diagnosis of a possible lymphoma. However, at the time of laparoscopy, a large gelatinous mass was found and the diagnosis of PMP was confirmed by histopathology. Debulking surgery with small bowel resections was performed following this diagnosis at the Royal University Hospital of Saskatchewan. Since then he remained well and was reviewed regularly in the outpatient clinic. Four years later (2003), the patient began experiencing obstructive symptoms again due to recurrent disease and he had a further extensive debulking surgery in January 2004. This was followed a year later by another cytoreductive surgery with small bowel resection in 2005. He is currently doing well at a 3 months post-operative follow-up visit.
The specimens from 2000 consisted of a portion of small bowel with several gelatinous, ""mucinous"" masses attached to the peritoneal surface of the serosa of the bowel wall accompanied by the presence of lobulated polypoid gelatinous tissue (Figure ). The specimens from 2004 and 2005 had a similar gross appearance. Histologically, however, the tumor showed significant progression over the years from a predominantly hypocellular, benign looking single layer of bland epithelium in extracellular pools of mucin in year 2000 (Figure ) to a mild increase in epithelial proliferation in 2004 to a hypercellular lesion associated with cytological atypia and numerous free ""cell clusters"" floating in the extracellular mucin pools and infiltrating the submucosa of the small bowel (Figure ) representing the PMCA variant with a documented past history of ruptured appendiceal mucinous neoplasm 23 years ago with no material available for current pathological review.","[[42.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['appendiceal', 'small bowel', 'abdomen', 'abdominal', 'tissue', 'small bowel', 'portion of small bowel', 'small bowel', 'peritoneal surface of the serosa of the bowel wall', 'gelatinous tissue', 'bland epithelium', 'epithelium', 'extracellular pools of mucin', 'epithelial', 'extracellular mucin pools', 'submucosa of the small bowel', 'PMCA', 'appendiceal']","['appendiceal mucinous neoplasm', 'asymptomatic', 'small bowel obstruction', 'weight loss', ""Crohn's disease"", 'abdominal mass', 'lymphoma', 'gelatinous mass', 'PMP', 'remained well', 'obstructive symptoms', 'disease', 'gelatinous', 'masses', 'lobulated polypoid gelatinous tissue', 'polypoid gelatinous tissue', 'tumor', 'single layer of bland epithelium', 'epithelial proliferation', 'hypercellular lesion', 'cytological atypia', 'free ""cell clusters"" floating in the extracellular mucin pools', 'infiltrating the submucosa of the small bowel', 'PMCA variant', 'ruptured appendiceal mucinous neoplasm', 'appendiceal mucinous neoplasm']",[],"['42', '23', 'fall', '1999', 'January 2000', 'Royal University Hospital', 'Saskatchewan', 'outpatient clinic', '2003', 'January 2004', '2005', '2000', '2004', '2005', '2000', '2004']","['appendiceal mucinous neoplasm that was removed', 'computed tomographic (CT) scan of his abdomen', 'laparoscopy', 'laparoscopy', 'laparoscopy', 'histopathology', 'Debulking surgery', 'small bowel resections', 'extensive debulking surgery', 'cytoreductive surgery', 'small bowel resection', 'Histologically', 'pathological']","['23 years ago', 'until the fall of 1999', 'January 2000', 'Four years later', 'January 2004', 'a year later', 'a year later', 'over the years', 'year 2000', '23 years ago', '23 years ago']"

He was investigated for his anemia and found by ultrasound to have multiple cystic structures within the peritoneal cavity. The CT scan confirmed the presence of multiple peritoneal masses associated with a large amount of intra-abdominal ascites (Figure ). At laparoscopy the abdominal cavity was filled with mucin. Biopsy and histopathological examination of the peritoneal mass confirmed the presence of PMP. Cytoreductive surgery inclusive of a right hemicolectomy was performed, followed by intra-peritoneal chemotherapy. The patient had been doing well for 4 years. Then, he complained of increased abdominal girth and coughing, and a CT scan showed recurrence of extensive amount of multiloculated material throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Therefore, the second debulking surgery was performed on September 1999. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged in a stable condition. In June 2002, he had the third debulking surgery for recurrent disease. In February 2003 he died from a myocardial infarction – an unrelated cause.
The gross appearance of the PMP was similar to the previously described case. A diagnosis of PMP originating from a mucinous neoplasm of low malignant potential (M-LMP) originating in the appendix from the hemicolectomy specimen of 1995 was confirmed microscopically. The lesion had prominent papillary architecture with mild to moderate nuclear atypia (Figure ). Foci of pseudomyxoma extraperitonei were also observed in sections of the skin.

Colonoscopy showed a large obstructing tumour in the descending colon, and a hemicolectomy was performed. Histology showed an inflammatory reaction, possibly caused by a fungal or parasitic infection, but no definite identification of an organism was made. Postoperatively his complaints disappeared, but after a few weeks he developed abdominal discomfort in his right upper abdomen, and six weeks postoperatively a CT scan revealed a large mass with a diameter of 6 cm central in the right liver lobe. Treatment with metronidazole, directed against an amoebic liver abscess, was unsuccessful. A subsequent four-week course with fluconazole resulted in a small decrease of the liver abscess, without clinical improvement. He developed a marked eosinophilia (27.7%). A liver biopsy was performed and the patient was referred to a university hospital.
A repeated CT scan showed a large mass with a diameter of 9 cm central in the liver, with extension to the right liver lobe (figure ). Review of the slides from the colonic mass and the liver biopsy showed similar features, with extensive necrosis and a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate containing histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells and numerous eosinophils. In Grocott stained sections, many unusually large hyphae could be recognized which were surrounded by strongly eosinophilic material in haematoxylin and eosin stained sections (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon) (figure ).
On the basis of this morphology, a presumptive diagnosis of infection with Basidiobolus spp. was made. A percutaneous cholangiodrain was placed to treat the cholestasis caused by the hepatic mass. A few days later, the patient developed a septic shock, probably of hepatic origin. Blood cultures yielded Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The presumed basidiobolomycosis was treated with amphotericin B intravenously, because the preferred therapy, intravenous itraconazole, was contra-indicated because of severe renal insufficiency. A few days after initiation of the antifungal therapy the patient died of multiple organ failure.

She complained of inguinal mass increasing in size for the 4 months preceding admission. She had a past history of an appendectomy for acute appendicitis 16 years previous to admission. No abnormalities were found in her complete blood and biochemistry profiles. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19-9), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) were all within normal limits, but CA125 was elevated to 360 U/ml at hospitalization. Ultrasonography, CT-scan and MRI demonstrated not only a right inguinal tumor, but also showed large pelvic tumors (Fig. &). The uterus was myomatous, but no evident tumor mass was identified elsewhere by whole body CT, MRI and scintigraphy. Endoscopic examinations of the esophagus, gastrointestinal and colorectal tracts did not reveal any sign of malignant tumor. The tumor growth pattern was rather expansive into the adjacent urinary bladder, uterus and rectum. She had several asymptomatic tiny gallbladder stones. She underwent complete tumor resection of the right inguinal tumors with salpingo-oophorectomy and partial resection of the rectal wall at the recto-sigmoid junction on July 1st, 1999.
CT on the 23rd postoperative day demonstrated new small asymptomatic inguinal tumors adjacent to the left external iliac artery. The diameter of those tumors was 15 mm and 12 mm, respectively. Those tumors were extirpated completely on July 29, 1999.
The right inguinal tumor, approximately 4.5 × 5 × 4 cm in diameter, was relatively well circumscribed by the right inguinal ligament, and right external iliac artery and vein, which are supplying and draining tumor blood flow. After extirpation of the inguinal tumors, the intra-pelvic tumors were removed completely by total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy and a partial resection of the rectum at the rectosigmoid junction (Fig. &). There was no direct invasion of the tumor into the urinary bladder and there was no evidence of remaining tumor in the abdominal cavity.
Grossly, the right inguinal tumor was elliptical and well circumscribed, measuring 42 × 25 × 12 mm in size. The cut surface of the solid tumor was swollen and reddish-white, with hemorrhagic and necrotic foci (Fig. ). Histologically, the tumor was encapsulated by dense fibrous tissue. The configurations of the individual tumor cells were cuboidal or polygonal and growing in a micropapillary pattern. The tumor cells had marked eosinophilic cytoplasm and moderately atypical nuclei. Many psammoma bodies [] were recognized and these findings facilitated the diagnosis of metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma (Fig. ). Almost all of the ovarian tissue had been replaced by a fibrothecoma without carcinoma cells, but tumor cells invaded from out side of the ovary (Fig. ). There were 4 leiomyomas within the uterus, but no cancer cells were recognized anywhere in the uterus. On the rectum wall, carcinoma cells infiltrated from the serosal side to the submucosal layer; however, no cancer cells had reached the mucosal layer (Fig. ).
Her postoperative course was uneventful, except for the early detection of the left inguinal node metastasis by CT on the 23rd postoperative day. This tumor was extirpated promptly and postoperative imaging procedures confirmed that no tumor remained anywhere in the body. Pathologic examinations revealed lymph node metastasis from a papillary serous adenocarcinoma (Fig. ). Preoperatively, daily oral administration of UFT (450 mg/day) Cimetidine (H2 receptor antagonist; 600 mg/day) and PSK (3 g/day) was started. We used Cimetidine not only as an anti-ulcer drug, but also as an immunomodulator or biological response modifier with the hope of eradicating possible microscopic residual cancer cells [-]. PSK was used as an immunomodulator against possible remaining adenocarcinoma cells somewhere in the body of this patient [,]. In order to increase the anti-tumor effect as well as decrease the toxicity, we tried intravenous single-day continuous infusion of low dose combination chemotherapy through a port implanted on the right upper chest wall with an access catheter (Groshong®) to the superior vena cava by way of the right subclavian vein. A portable elastomeric infusion system filled with 50 ml saline dissolution of Mitomycin C (MMC; 6 mg) and Adriamycin (ADM; l0mg) was applied every other week at an outpatient clinic. Three months after we changed from UFT to 5'-FDUR (600 mg/day) because MMC may be more effective with 5'-FDUR (due to stronger inductive activity of thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase) in tumor tissues [,].
The implanted port and access catheter were removed two years later. The serum tumor markers CA-125, CEA and CA19-9 were checked every month and image diagnostic screening by CT and US were carried out every three months during 4 postoperative years, however, no suggestive signs of relapse had been found anywhere in the body. However, from 4.5 years after the last surgery, the serum level of CA-125 had gradually elevated to 140.5 U/ml and the CT scans demonstrated newly developed asymptomatic single tumor growth (25 × 20 mm) on the right deep inguinal node (Fig. ), though no evident tumor was found anywhere else in the body. Complete tumor removal was carried out and the serum CA125 decreased to within the normal range (Fig. ). Pathologic examination revealed that papillary serous adenocarcinoma cells were growing in the lymph node in a micropapillary pattern and many psammoma bodies were recognized (Fig. ).

Pathologic staging revealed a Duke's stage C tumor or C1 according to the Astler-Coller classification. A decision was made to administer adjuvant chemotherapy using the FOLFOX-4 regimen (5-FU, 400 mg/m2 bolus infusion on days 1, 2 followed by 5-FU, 600 mg/m2 as a continuous infusion for 22 hours on days 1, 2, leucovorin 200 mg/m2 as a 2 hour infusion prior to 5-FU on days 1, 2 and L-OHP 85 mg/m2 on day 1, every 2 weeks). He was programmed to receive a total of 6 monthly cycles. Treatment was well tolerated until the 4th cycle, at the beginning of which the patient's hematologic profile and renal function were normal (Hb: 13,8 g/dl, HCT: 43%, WBC: 4,9 × 109cells/L, platelets: 162 × 103 cells/μg, creatinine: 1,1 mg/dl, BUN: 35 mg/dl).
On the first day of therapy, and after L-OHP infusion was completed, the patient noticed urine discoloration and immediate urine analysis demonstrated hematuria with hemoglobinuria. During the next day, the patient's complete blood count exhibited findings consistent with acute hemolysis and thrombocytopenia (Hb: 12 g/dl, Hct: 36%, WBC: 4,78 × 109 cells/L and platelets: 50 × 103 cells/μl). A hemolytic reaction was indicated by elevated LDH and indirect bilirubin indices (1383 U/l and 3,34 mg%, respectively). The patient also exhibited signs of acute anuric renal failure (urea: 77 mg%, serum creatinine: 3,1 mg% and uric acid: 9,5 mg%). Peripheral smear analysis demonstrated fragmented RBCs.
Chemotherapy was immediately discontinued and the patient was managed conservatively with monitored IV hydration and loop diuretics, high dose corticosteroids and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) infusions on a daily basis.
The development of hemolysis was further substantiated with next day's laboratory results. LDH remained elevated at 819 U/l. Coagulation parameters were normal, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen and INR were 31,1 sec, 412 mg/dl and 1.05, respectively. D-dimmers were 9,1 μg/ml. The patient was not G6-PD deficient (G6-PD: 11.0 U/g Hb). Direct and indirect agglutination reactions remained negative providing no indication of immune mediated hemolysis. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values reached a minimum of 11.8 g/dl and 34.8% respectively, four days after the infusion of L-OHP. At that point, LDH was 499 U/l and BUN and creatinine were 149 mg/dl and 5,6 mg/dl, respectively.
The patient gradually recovered and the results of successive hematological and biochemical tests confirmed the improvement of his condition. Fifteen days after the onset of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia laboratory values were returning to normal: Hb: 12,1 g/dl, Hct: 38,2%, platelets: 151 × 103 cells/μl, LDH: 255 U/l, creatinine: 1,5 mg/dl, BUN: 78 mg/dl. A month later, all hematologic values and the urine analysis had returned to normal. The patient refused the continuation of chemotherapy. On follow-up, one year after the hemolytic episode, the patient remained disease free and asymptomatic, with no evidence of recurrence of hemolysis or thrombocytopenia.

The lesion had been present for eight weeks and had not improved despite a six week course of antibiotics from his general practitioner. The lesion had increased in size over the last two weeks and at one point the patient noticed it had bled slightly whilst he was shaving. There had been no other discharge.
During the two weeks before presentation the patient had been feeling generally unwell with fatigue and lethargy. He also reported weight loss of about 5 kg over the last month.
On further questioning he described some left sided dull, 'dragging' abdominal pain and associated back pain. He denied any change in his bowel habit and had no haematuria or other urinary symptoms. He had no past medical history and was not on any medications. He was a non-smoker.
On examination the patient was lethargic with a prominent lesion on his chin 2 cm in diameter. The lesion was erythematous, tender, tense and was similar to the appearance of an abscess. He was afebrile.
On examination of the abdomen he was found to have a number of purpuric spots over the upper torso and hepatosplenomegaly.
Investigations showed normal full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests and chest X-ray. His C-reactive protein was elevated at 155.
In view of his weight loss and hepatosplenomegaly he was admitted under the medical team for further investigation with a suspicion of lymphoreticular malignancy.
The surgical team were asked to review regarding the ""abscess"" on the patient's chin. However, due to the pending investigations a decision was made to wait for the results before contemplating incision and drainage.
The patient had a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis which diagnosed a left renal carcinoma 12 cm in diameter arising from the anterior cortex, but no thrombus or tumour was identified in the left renal vein. The patient was then referred to the urology team.
The urology team arranged a chest CT scan and a bone scan which were normal and subsequently performed left radical nephrectomy and biopsy of his chin lesion.
The histology of his left kidney showed clear cell renal carcinoma, Stage 3, with tumour invading the left renal vein at the kidney hilum (G3 pT3b N0 M1).
Malignant cells were found in the chin biopsy histology, which were consistent with metastatic carcinoma.
The patient was referred to the oncologists for further treatment. He underwent subcutaneous interferon injections at a dose of 5 mega units three times per week for a total of 4 months. He also underwent radiotherapy to the site of the lesion on his chin, followed by resection of the lump. One year later the patient developed some pain in his iliac crest and right posterior ribs for which he underwent palliative radiotherapy although bone scan and X-rays did not show any evidence of metastasis.
It is now two and a half years since diagnosis and the patient remains disease free, having had a recent follow up CT scan which showed no evidence of recurrence.","[[36.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['chin', 'abdominal', 'back', 'bowel', 'urinary', 'chin', 'abdomen', 'upper torso', 'liver', 'chest', 'chin', 'abdomen', 'pelvis', 'left renal', 'anterior cortex', 'left renal vein', 'chest', 'bone', 'left radical', 'chin', 'left kidney', 'renal', 'left renal vein', 'kidney hilum', 'chin', 'site of the lesion', 'site of the lesion on his chin', 'iliac crest', 'right posterior ribs', 'bone']","['abscess', 'lesion', 'lesion', 'bled', 'discharge', 'feeling generally unwell', 'fatigue', 'lethargy', 'weight loss', 'abdominal pain', 'back pain', 'change in his bowel habit', 'haematuria', 'urinary symptoms', 'non-smoker', 'lethargic', 'lesion', 'lesion', 'abscess', 'afebrile', 'purpuric spots', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'weight loss', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'lymphoreticular malignancy', 'abscess', 'left renal carcinoma', 'thrombus', 'tumour', 'chin lesion', 'clear cell renal carcinoma', 'tumour', 'Malignant cells', 'metastatic carcinoma', 'lump', 'pain', 'metastasis', 'diagnosis', 'disease', 'recurrence']",[],"['36', 'emergency department', 'urology']","['antibiotics', 'medications', 'full blood count', 'urea', 'electrolytes', 'liver function tests', 'chest X-ray', 'C-reactive protein', 'investigations', 'incision', 'incision and drainage', 'computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis', 'chest CT scan', 'bone scan', 'left radical nephrectomy', 'biopsy', 'biopsy of his chin lesion', 'histology of his left kidney', 'chin biopsy histology', 'treatment', 'interferon injections', 'radiotherapy', 'resection of the lump', 'palliative radiotherapy', 'radiotherapy', 'bone scan', 'X-rays', 'CT scan']","['eight weeks', 'over the last two weeks', 'two weeks', 'two weeks before presentation', 'over the last month', 'One year later', 'two and a half years']"

He presented with a three month history of increasing apathy, gait difficulties and memory dysfunction. On examination he showed normal vital signs. Neurological examination revealed ataxic gait, memory impairment, reduced attention and slow verbal response. A HIV-1 antibody test was positive and his CD4-cell count was 50 ×10e6 cells/l. A brain MRI scan revealed no intracranial pathology except for areas of increased signal changes in T2 MRI sequences in periventricular white matter. Following MRI scan a lumbar puncture and additional blood tests were performed. Routine laboratory tests were normal except for an elevated sedimentation rate (76 mm/h). Tests and cultures in CSF and blood for bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and protozoal infections, including PCR tests for JC-virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and toxoplasmosis in CSF, antigen test for cryptococci in CSF, and antibody test for syphilis in CSF and blood, were negative. CSF PCR tests for diagnostic purposes were run as soon as possible after sampling. CSF cytology was normal. Thus, brain MRI scan and CSF assessment showed no evidence of other infections or malignancies. CSF and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CSF cell counts, and CD4 cell counts are presented in figure . After additional neurological and psychiatric tests, performed by an experienced neurologist, a diagnosis of HIV dementia (MSK stage 3)[,] was made.

He showed a gradual neurocognitive improvement that was paralleled by a decline in plasma and CSF HIV-1 RNA levels as well as levels of CSF NFL, Tau, GFAP, neopterin, TAU, albumin ratio, and IgG index (figure ). CSF levels of S-100 protein and NSE were below the upper limit of normal before treatment initiation.

Barium enema and colonoscopy revealed an ulcerative tumor in the ascending colon, which was diagnosed as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma on biopsy. Physical examination showed no remarkable abnormalities. Neither hepatomegaly nor splenomegaly were apparent. Serum hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody were negative, and she had no history of alcohol intake or blood transfusion. Laboratory data on admission including liver function tests were unremarkable. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and α-fetoprotein (AFP) were within normal ranges. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic, 1.5-cm diameter mass in the left hepatic lobe (S3). Computed tomography (CT) revealed a low-density area in the same area, the interior of which enhanced equally. The outline of the mass was particularly enhanced in equilibrium phase (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a slightly low-intensity lesion on T1-weighted images; this was high-Intensity on T2-weighted images (Fig. ). Furthermore, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) uptake was not detected on T2-weighted images. Consequently, as metastatic liver tumor could not be definitively excluded, the patient underwent right hemicolectomy and S3 partial hepatectomy on 1 November 2004.
An ulcerated tumor with sharply demarcation was present in the ascending colon and histopathological examination revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. No lymph node metastasis was detected. Macroscopically, cut section of the resected liver showed a well-circumscribed, encapsulated, yellowish-white mass in S3 of the liver. It measured 1.5 cm in diameter (Fig. ). The tumor appeared relatively soft and elastic and was composed of many lymphoid follicles with large germinal centers containing small polymorphic lymphocytes (Fig. ). Many plasma cells surrounded mature lymphoid aggregates. Furthermore, remarkable lymphoid infiltration with germinal center formation was seen in the portal area around the nodule. However, the hepatic parenchyma distant from this nodule was normal and lymphoid infiltration was not detected in the portal area. No evidence of adenocarcinoma metastasis and no cytologic atypia of the germinal centers or interfollicular areas were detected. Immunohistochemical studies revealed the germinal centers to be composed of CD-20-positive and Bcl-2-negative lymphocytes. Furthermore, lymphocytes surrounding the germinal centers and interfollicular areas were positive for CD-3 and Bcl-2. Plasma cells were positive for both κ and λ light chains at an equal frequency (data not shown). These findings revealed the polyclonal origins of the infiltrating lymphocytes. Consequently, this nodular lesion was diagnosed as RLH of the liver.

of Multiple Sexually Transmitted Infections","A 24-year-old primigravida with an unknown last menstrual
period presented to the emergency room with a 3-month
history of lower abdominal and lower back pain that radiated
into her right thigh. The pain occurred two to three
times daily, lasting 5 minutes with each episode and worsening
during the few days prior to presentation. During the
three previous months the patient described irregular vaginal bleeding and watery vaginal discharge. 
She was evaluated two months previously at another hospital and was diagnosed as
having a “cyst.” She was discharged with a narcotic prescription
that she noted had improved her pain, but did not relieve it.
Her medical history revealed no prior surgeries or any
history of assisted reproduction. Coitarche began at 14 years
of age and she noted a minimum of 15 previous sexual partners.
Hospital medical records listed positive toxicology
screen results for illegal drugs on multiple emergency room
visits. During the previous 6 years, culture and serology results
documented four prior separate infections with Chlamydia
trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, herpes simplex virus
2, and Treponema pallidum, respectively. The patient reported
that she completed treatment for all four infections. Current
testing for C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae by DNA
probe was negative for both species. Serum testing for rapid
plasma reagin (RPR) was also negative. The patient did not
demonstrate any clinical sequelae of herpes simplex virus
and thus testing for this STI was not performed on the current
admission.
On physical exam, the patient was afebrile, and her vital
signs were stable. Abdominal palpation elicited tenderness in 
the right lower quadrant. Pelvic examination revealed blood
in the vagina, a closed cervical os, uterine tenderness, and a
palpable right adnexal mass. Rectovaginal exam concurred
with the pelvic exam and stool guaiac testing for occult blood
was negative.
Diagnostic testing showed a quantitative serum β-HCG
titer of 263 mIU/mL, a hematocrit of 38%, and a serum progesterone
level of 2.2 ng/mL. Additionally, ultrasonographic
examination displayed a 10 × 10 × 8 cm right adnexal mass
containing a nonviable twin pregnancy with each fetal
crown-rump length corresponding to a gestational age of 9.3
weeks. A separating linear echo was seen in the mass between
the two fetuses ().
An exploratory laparotomy revealed a hemoperitoneum
containing 300 mL and a 10 cm right-sided pelvic mass incorporating
the right fallopian tube and ovary. Small intestine
and the appendix were adherent by fibrous adhesions to
the mass. The contralateral ovary and fallopian tube had numerous
adhesions distorting their normal anatomy. A right
salpingoophorectomy, an appendectomy, and an extensive
lysis of adhesions were performed. The patient's postoperative
course was uncomplicated.
Pathological evaluation of the surgical specimen showed
a twin pregnancy within the fallopian tube (). During
more detailed histopathologic examination, the finding
of a dividing membrane established the pregnancy to be
monochorionic diamnionic, and measurement of the twin
fetuses estimated their gestational age at 7 weeks.","[[24.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['lower abdominal', 'lower back', 'right thigh', 'vaginal', 'vaginal', 'Abdominal', 'right lower quadrant', 'Pelvic', 'vagina', 'cervical os', 'uterine', 'right adnexal', 'Rectovaginal', 'pelvic', 'right adnexal', 'between\nthe two fetuses', 'two fetuses', 'hemoperitoneum', 'right-sided pelvic', 'right fallopian tube', 'ovary', 'Small intestine', 'appendix', 'contralateral ovary', 'fallopian tube', 'fallopian tube']","['primigravida', 'last menstrual\nperiod', 'pain', 'pain', 'vaginal bleeding', 'vaginal discharge', 'pain', 'assisted reproduction', 'Coitarche', 'infections', 'Chlamydia\ntrachomatis', 'Neisseria gonorrhoeae', 'herpes simplex virus\n2', 'Treponema', 'Treponema pallidum', 'infections', 'herpes simplex virus', 'afebrile', 'Abdominal palpation', 'tenderness', 'blood', 'closed cervical os', 'uterine tenderness', 'right adnexal mass', 'occult blood', 'right adnexal mass', 'twin pregnancy', 'fetal\ncrown-rump length', 'gestational age', 'separating linear echo', 'mass between\nthe two fetuses', 'hemoperitoneum\ncontaining 300 mL', 'right-sided pelvic mass', 'adherent by fibrous adhesions to\nthe mass', 'adhesions distorting their normal anatomy', 'adhesions', 'postoperative\ncourse was uncomplicated', 'twin pregnancy', 'twin pregnancy within the fallopian tube', 'dividing membrane', 'pregnancy', 'twin\nfetuses', 'gestational age']",[],"['24', 'emergency room', '14', 'emergency room']","['narcotic', 'surgeries', 'toxicology\nscreen', 'culture', 'serology', 'treatment', 'C trachomatis', 'N gonorrhoeae', 'DNA\nprobe', 'Serum testing for rapid\nplasma reagin (RPR)', 'testing for this STI', 'physical exam', 'vital\nsigns', 'Rectovaginal exam', 'pelvic exam', 'stool guaiac testing', 'Diagnostic testing', 'hematocrit', 'serum progesterone\nlevel', 'ultrasonographic\nexamination', 'exploratory laparotomy', 'right\nsalpingoophorectomy', 'appendectomy', 'extensive\nlysis of adhesions', 'Pathological evaluation of the surgical specimen', 'histopathologic examination']","['3-month', 'few days prior', 'three previous months', 'three previous months', 'previous 6 years', 'previous 6 years', 'current\nadmission', '9.3\nweeks', '7 weeks']"

24-hour duration was admitted to our hospital. Her gynecologic
history was unremarkable having undergone an eventful menopause.
She had no history of postmenopausal bleeding or increased vaginal
discharge. On the physical examination, her abdomen was very
tender, distended, and showed muscle rigidity. Rebound tenderness
was absent. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. Her blood pressure was
110/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 114 beats/min, and axillary temperature
was 36.9°C. Laboratory studies demonstrated a white cell
count of 5100/mm3 with 92.3% neutrophilia and hemoglobin of 13 g/dL. A plain chest X-ray film showed free air under the diaphragm on both sides. The abdominal X-ray
revealed no evidence of intestinal obstruction. Computed tomography scan of abdomen
reported the presence of fluid within the abdominal cavity.
Emergency explorative laparotomy was performed under the diagnosis
of perforation of the gastrointestinal tract. The investigation of
the gastrointestinal tract and gallbladder failed to reveal a
perforation. The uterus was found to have two perforations,
approximately 1 cm in diameter each, both in the uterine
fundus, and purulent material exuding from the uterine cavity was
identified. The uterus was soft and slightly enlarged. Both
parametriums were thickened and inflammatory changes were present.
The fallopian tubes and the ovaries were normal. A total abdominal
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed.
Culture of the pus grew Escherichia coli and
Bacteroides fragilis. Histological examination revealed
pyometra with no evidence of malignancy.
She was observed in the intensive care unit with strict management of
respiration and circulation for postoperative three days. On the
third postoperative day, she was transferred to the gynecology unit.
Under the antibiotherapy with cefepime and metronidazole, her
condition improved postoperatively. However, on the tenth
postoperative day, wound dehiscence occurred and secondary wound
closure was performed. No other complications have occurred, and as

in Pregnancy Presented as Ludwig's Angina","A 24-year old black female, G4P3, at 29 weeks gestation, was
presented to a local hospital complaining of facial swelling
(). The patient's only significant medical
history included history of anemia and sickle cell trait. She
described that her pregnancy had been proceeding without
difficulty, except for a three-day history of lower left quadrant
tooth pain, and a one-day history of fever and chills. On
presentation, her vital signs were the following: temperature
38.5°C, blood pressure 115/44, pulse 118/min,
respiratory rate 18/min, oxygen saturation on room air
96%, and white cell count of 16800/μL. Her clinical
presentation included large soft tissue swelling under her
mandible, extending bilaterally to the angles of the mandible and
inferiorly approximately down to her hyoid bone. Because of her
severe impending airway deterioration, she was flown by helicopter
to a tertiary medical center for definitive care. In the Emergency
Room of the University of Florida Shands Hospital, the diagnosis
of Ludwig's angina was made. It was difficult to perform an
adequate oral exam secondary to pain, swelling, and severe trismus
() which allowed her to open her mouth to
only 15 mm (average range 40–45 mm). The patient was
having difficulty maintaining her own salivary secretions because
of dysphagea but denied dyspnea. Since in similar situations
patients can desaturate very quickly, even though her oxygen
saturation was recorded to be 96% on room air, she was given
supplemental oxygen and a pulse oxymeter was placed on her right
index finger because of possible impending quick respiratory
difficulties. Of note, although not used, an emergent
cricothyrotomy kit was available at the patient's bedside at all
times. The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS)
formally consulted the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology
(Ob/Gyn) and Anesthesiology. Understanding that in administering
medications and/or undergoing any surgical treatment in pregnancy,
one must consider the risks and the benefits both to the mother
and the unborn, it was determined that the benefits of proceeding
with emergent and immediate surgical intervention outweighed the
risks. An emergent CT-scan showed fluid collections in the left
lateral pharyngeal space () extending to the
level of the valleculae. Securing an airway via an awake
fiberoptic nasal intubation was risky: a fiberoptic tube inserted
into the pharynx might puncture an abscess and cause pus
aspiration or swallowing. Therefore, an awake tracheostomy was
performed using a 60-nonfenestrated Schiley endotracheal tube. At
that time general anesthesia was administered and the patient was
placed in slight left lateral decubitus position to decrease
uterine aortocaval compression pressure. After usual sterile
preparation, lidocaine with epinephrine was infiltrated for local
anesthesia. An incision was made at the submental and bilateral
submandibular areas and blunt dissection to the lingual inferior
border of the mandible was carried out. Through the submental
incision, the blunt dissection continued through the mylohyoid
muscle to the sublingual areas to access all abscesses. Tooth
number 17 (lower left third molar) was then extracted since it was
believed that this grossly carious and partially impacted tooth
was the primary source for the infection. Upon removal, purulence
was expressed through the extraction socket. Five additional
grossly carious teeth were then extracted. Intraoral blunt
dissection to gain access into the lateral pharyngeal space
followed for drainage of another pus collection. Numerous Penrose
drains and red rubber catheter drains were left in place to
maintain drainage of pus and facilitate daily irrigation
(). Upon admission to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit, the Department of Ob/Gyn continued following up on the
patient by frequent monitoring of the fetal heart rate. The
patient was extubated after 6 days and remained in the hospital
until discharge the following day. On discharge, the patient's
progress was monitored by the Departments of OMFS and Ob/Gyn.","[[24.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['facial', 'lower left quadrant\ntooth', 'soft tissue', 'under her\nmandible', 'angles of the mandible', 'hyoid bone', 'airway', 'oral', 'mouth', 'salivary', 'right\nindex finger', 'respiratory', 'Oral', 'Maxillofacial', 'left\nlateral pharyngeal space', 'level of the valleculae', 'airway', 'nasal', 'pharynx', 'uterine aortocaval', 'submental', 'bilateral\nsubmandibular', 'bilateral\nsubmandibular areas', 'lingual inferior\nborder of the mandible', 'submental', 'mylohyoid\nmuscle to the sublingual areas', 'sublingual areas', 'Tooth\nnumber 17', 'tooth', 'extraction socket', 'teeth', 'lateral pharyngeal space', 'heart']","['G4P3', 'gestation', 'facial swelling', 'anemia', 'sickle cell trait', 'pregnancy', 'difficulty', 'lower left quadrant\ntooth pain', 'fever', 'chills', 'soft tissue swelling', 'airway deterioration', ""Ludwig's angina"", 'pain', 'swelling', 'trismus', 'difficulty maintaining her own salivary secretions', 'dysphagea', 'dyspnea', 'desaturate', 'respiratory\ndifficulties', 'pregnancy', 'fluid collections', 'puncture an abscess', 'pus\naspiration', 'swallowing', 'abscesses', 'carious', 'impacted tooth', 'infection', 'purulence', 'carious teeth', 'pus collection', 'Numerous Penrose\ndrains and red rubber catheter drains were left in place', 'drainage of pus', 'pus']","['lidocaine', 'epinephrine']","['24-year', 'University of Florida Shands Hospital', 'Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology', 'Surgical Intensive', 'Departments']","['vital signs', 'temperature', 'blood pressure', 'pulse', 'respiratory rate', 'oxygen saturation', 'white cell count', 'definitive care', 'oral exam', 'oxygen\nsaturation', 'supplemental oxygen', 'pulse oxymeter', 'pulse oxymeter was placed on her right\nindex finger', 'Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery', 'OMFS', 'medications', 'surgical treatment', 'surgical intervention', 'CT-scan', 'awake\nfiberoptic nasal intubation', 'fiberoptic tube inserted\ninto the pharynx', 'awake tracheostomy was\nperformed using a 60-nonfenestrated Schiley endotracheal tube', 'general anesthesia', 'local\nanesthesia', 'incision', 'incision was made at the submental and bilateral\nsubmandibular areas', 'blunt dissection to the lingual inferior\nborder of the mandible', 'submental\nincision', 'blunt dissection continued through the mylohyoid\nmuscle to the sublingual areas to access all abscesses', 'Tooth\nnumber 17 (lower left third molar) was then extracted', 'removal', 'Five additional\ngrossly carious teeth were then extracted', 'Intraoral blunt\ndissection to gain access into the lateral pharyngeal space\nfollowed for drainage of another pus collection', 'irrigation', 'fetal heart rate', 'extubated']","['29 weeks', 'three-day', 'one-day', 'one-day', 'after 6 days']"

She was a diabetic patient and she had no history of sexually transmitted
disease. She had 3 pregnancies and all of her deliveries were normal vaginal deliveries. On physical examination, she looked acutely ill: her body temperature was 38.1°C, pulse rate was 126 beats/min, and blood pressure was 140/70 mmHg. Her
abdomen was soft and was not distended. General tenderness with muscular guarding was recognized.
The results of laboratory studies on admission were as follows: white blood cell count: 18700/mL; red blood cell count: 3.4 × 106 /mL; hemoglobin: 10 g/dL; albumin: 2.4 mg/dL. Ultrasonography demonstrated a large amount of ascites in Morison
pouch. Computed tomography (CT) with an intravenous injection of contrast material visualized a calcified uterine body and fluid and ascites without free air. She was diagnosed as having diffuse peritonitis due to a perforated gastrointestinal tract. After
obtaining adequate informed consent, laparotomy was performed on the basis of a diagnosis of perforation of the gastrointestinal tract but revealed a perforated pyometra. At laparotomy, about 900 mL of pus was found in the peritoneal cavity. There were no abnormal findings in the alimentary tract, liver, or gallbladder. A total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were carried out. A culture of the pus was negative. A histological examination of the resected specimen revealed pyometra.

Flexible bronchoscopy was normal and fine needle aspiration cytology revealed a squamous cell carcinoma. Physical examination and routine laboratory data were unremarkable. Echocardiography was normal and FVC and FEV1 were 2.84 L and 2.45 L respectively. Chest CT scanning revealed no mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Additionally, brain and upper abdominal CTs scanning, as well as Technetium Tc 99 m bone scintigraphy, were all normal. The patient underwent a left lower lobectomy through a lateral thoracotomy and a rather peripheral tumour measuring 4 × 3 cm was found. No nodal involvement was observed macroscopically and this was confirmed with frozen sections of nodal sampling obtained from sites 5, 9, 10 and 11. Biopsy of the tumour proved to be a pT2N0, well differentiated, squamous cell carcinoma. Double lumen endotracheal tube and high thoracic epidural analgesia catheter for pain management were routinely used. No blood or blood products were transfused. The patient was extubated immediately postoperatively and the routine chest X-ray at the recovery room was reported normal with good expansion of the upper lobe with no residual pneumothorax (Fig. ). Early postoperative course was uneventful. However, 8 hours later SpO2 pulse oximetry was noted to decline gradually, without any remarkable respiratory deterioration. Repeated chest radiography showed a left upper lobe consolidation (Fig. ). Urgent bronchoscopy revealed occlusion of the lower left main bronchus; neither the left lower bronchial stump could be seen, nor the left upper bronchus could be entered. With a high index of suspicion of lobar torsion, the patient underwent urgent reoperation. Once the thoracic cavity was entered, the upper lobe was found to be ischemic and atelectatic with its diaphragmatic surface facing in an anterosuperior orientation. Just before clamping the hilum, the lobe was unfortunately re-orientated taking its proper position and immediately regained its physiological colour. The hilum was quickly clamped en-block. A completion pneumonectomy was easily carried out. At the end of the procedure, the patient developed a right pupil dilatation and it became obvious that a massive cerebral embolism had occurred. A subsequent brain angio CT scanning revealed total obstruction of the right middle cerebral artery, presumably due to emboli from the occluded pulmonary vein. The patient died at the intensive care unit 26 days later.","[[62.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['left lower lobe peripheral', 'Chest', 'mediastinal', 'brain', 'upper abdominal', 'bone', 'left lower lobectomy', 'nodal', 'sites 5, 9, 10 and 11', 'lumen', 'high thoracic epidural', 'chest', 'upper lobe', 'respiratory', 'chest', 'left upper lobe', 'lower left main bronchus', 'left lower bronchial', 'left lower bronchial stump', 'left upper bronchus', 'lobar', 'thoracic cavity', 'upper lobe', 'diaphragmatic surface', 'hilum', 'lobe', 'hilum', 'right pupil', 'cerebral', 'brain', 'right middle cerebral artery', 'pulmonary vein']","['left lower lobe peripheral mass', 'malignancy', 'squamous cell carcinoma', 'mediastinal lymphadenopathy', 'peripheral tumour', 'nodal involvement', 'tumour', 'squamous cell carcinoma', 'good expansion of the upper lobe', 'pneumothorax', 'uneventful', 'respiratory deterioration', 'left upper lobe consolidation', 'occlusion of the lower left main bronchus', 'left lower bronchial stump', 'lobar torsion', 'ischemic', 'atelectatic', 'diaphragmatic surface facing in an anterosuperior orientation', 're-orientated', 'regained its physiological colour', 'right pupil dilatation', 'cerebral embolism', 'total obstruction of the right middle cerebral artery', 'obstruction of the right middle cerebral artery', 'emboli', 'occluded pulmonary vein', 'died']",[],"['62', 'recovery room', 'intensive care unit']","['Flexible bronchoscopy', 'fine needle aspiration cytology', 'Physical examination', 'laboratory data', 'Echocardiography', 'FVC', 'FEV1', 'Chest CT scanning', 'CTs scanning', 'bone scintigraphy', 'left lower lobectomy through a lateral thoracotomy', 'frozen sections of nodal sampling', 'Biopsy of the tumour', 'Double lumen endotracheal tube', 'high thoracic epidural analgesia catheter', 'pain management', 'blood or blood products were transfused', 'blood products', 'extubated', 'chest X-ray', 'SpO2 pulse oximetry', 'chest radiography', 'bronchoscopy', 'reoperation', 'clamping the hilum', 'hilum was quickly clamped en-block', 'completion pneumonectomy', 'procedure', 'brain angio CT scanning']","['postoperatively', 'postoperative', '8 hours later']"

Previous angiography demonstrated a 50% proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery obstruction with a 99% occlusion to the mid and distal portions, a 50% proximal circumflex lesion and a 90% distal right coronary artery (RCA) obstruction with poor vessels distal to the occlusion. Subsequent to that angiogram, percutaneous interventions (PCI) were performed to all three vessels, with bare metal stents being placed in the circumflex and LAD arteries and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) being performed on the RCA. A more recent angiogram performed four months prior to admission demonstrated an unsuccessful PTCA of the RCA and occlusion of the distal LAD. The circumflex vessel had minimal disease. A large anterioapical aneurysm was demonstrated by the ventriculogram performed at that time (Figure ).
Upon arrival to the emergency department, she required intubation for the management of her pulmonary edema. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated decreased left ventricular (LV) function with an ejection fraction estimated at thirty percent. An extensive 8 by 10 centimeter anterioapical aneurysm was visualized. No mitral regurgitation was present and thrombus was not seen within the ventricle or aneurysm. After stabilization, she was transferred to our institution for ongoing care and surgical consideration.
Part history was remarkable for severe COPD (FEV1 25% predicted), atrial fibrillation and ileus.

He had clinical signs of foot drop, with 0/5 muscle strength during plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion. His Achilles reflex was absent. Two-point discrimination was absent over the anterior and lateral calf and foot, with anesthesia present in the great toe, plantar fascia, heel, and calf. Anesthesia was also present in the plantar fascia of the left foot as well, with sensory Paresthesia present on the dorsum of the left foot and great toe. He was able to feel digital pressure in the superior portion of the anterior tibialis, but could not distinguish sharp and light touches. He was not being pharmacologically managed for his diabetes, and did not take any prescription medications. He reported taking only a tablespoon of red wine vinegar once daily. The patient had a mesomorphic build, and had no prior history of low back pain in the last year. In March of 2004, the patient claims that he fell in his front yard while gardening. Upon falling, he claims to have heard a loud ""pop"" in his lower back, but did not feel any back pain afterward. About one week after falling, he began feeling tingling and weakness in his right leg and foot. His primary care physician referred him for a lumbar spine MRI, needle electromyography, and nerve conduction velocity testing of the lower extremities.
Results of the electrodiagnostic testing showed a right L4 and L5 radiculopathy, and a lumbar plexopathy. The lumbar spine MRI report concluded L4 and L5 posterolateral disc herniations, with compression on the anterior elements. Table shows the results of the initial EMG study. Nerve conduction velocity of the right common peroneal nerve showed no response. The right posterior tibial nerve showed a prolonged distal latency with normal amplitude and low conduction velocity. The left common peroneal nerve showed normal latency with low amplitude and low conduction velocity of 37 meters per second (mps). The right sural nerve showed low amplitude with normal latency. The H-reflexes showed prolonged latency bilaterally.
The patient was referred for physical therapy, where he was fitted for an ankle-foot orthosis to maintain a dorsiflexed foot position. His physical therapy routine consisted of ambulatory exercises to modify his gait to the orthosis, ankle and foot range-of-motion exercises with therapist assistance, and strengthening exercises for the right calf and gluteal regions.
After three months with no apparent improvement, the patient voluntarily discontinued care against medical advice and reported to the author's office. His initial self-rated disability was 43%, as measured by a Functional Rating Index, found to have an acceptable level of reliability and validity []. He did not report any pain in his leg, and scored a 0/10 on a numeric pain rating scale.

Physical examination and transthoracic echocardiographic study did not disclose any abnormality. Baseline ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QRS intervals and no evidence of preexcitation. Antiarrhythmic drugs (propranolol and verapamil) were discontinued two days before the procedure. Baseline intervals in sinus rhythm were as follows: sinus cycle length=690 msec, AH=74 msec, HV=37 msec, QRS=90 msec, PR=133 msec. The minimal pacing cycle length maintaining 1:1 antegrade conduction (AVWP) was 320 msec and the minimal pacing cycle length maintaining 1:1 retrograde conduction (VAWP) was 400 msec. Single extrastimulus testing in the right atrium and the right ventricular apex leaded to a sustained narrow complex tachycardia. The arrhythmia was a short PR- long RP tachycardia with following characteristics: cycle length=376 msec, AH=141 msec, HV=42 msec, VA=200 msec, HA (HRA) =236 msec, HA (His) =243 msec and eccentric atrial activation during the arrhythmia (). The arrhythmia was easily reproducible with stable hemodynamic.
A ventricular extrastimulus delivered at RV septum in the inflow region synchronous with His activation during the arrhythmia neither advanced nor delayed the subsequent atrial activation. Earlier ventricular premature beat at the RV septum terminated the arrhythmia (the His was not refractory) without conduction to the atrium. Right ventricular apical pacing at a cycle length just shorter than the tachycardia cycle length showed the same retrograde atrial activation sequence as during the arrhythmia.
Subsequently, the right atrioventricular annulus was mapped in the tachycardia and the shortest VA interval was noted at the posterolateral of tricuspid annulus. The radiofrequency current was delivered to this site at the ventricular aspect of tricuspid annulus and resulted in termination of the arrhythmia within 5 seconds. The successful ablation site had a VA interval of 109 msec ().
Following this ablation, programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation failed to induce any arrhythmia and retrograde atrial activity sequence during burst ventricular pacing was concentric. Comparing retrograde atrial activity sequence before ablation with retrograde atrial activity sequence after ablation in the same pacing cycle length showed a significant decrease in VA interval after ablation of the accessory pathway ().

A wide excision was performed with two subsequent re-excisions performed in 2001. At that time she received a split-thickness skin graft and a left inguinal sentinel node biopsy which was negative for malignancy. Punch biopsies were also obtained from multiple tan-brown lesions on both legs. These biopsies showed both typical and atypical melanocytic hyperplasia along with compound and dermal nevi. In 2002, more biopsies of the left lower leg were performed, revealing squamous cell hyperplasia. In February of 2005, she presented to us with a left lower leg skin lesion in the same area as the prior melanoma. The lesion was excised and submitted for pathologic evaluation.
The specimen was a skin ellipse measuring 1.5 × 0.7 cm with an excisional depth of 0.7 cm. Centrally located on the external surface of the skin was a dark brown, discolored macular area with irregular borders measuring 0.1 × 0.1 cm. The lesion did not appear to involve the margins of the specimen, which was entirely submitted for formalin processing.
5-um sections from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue were used for routine light microscopic study. The sections showed deep dermal and subcutaneous nested proliferations of spindle and epithelioid cells arranged in a wedge-shaped pattern with the base in parallel with the reticular dermis andthe apex oriented toward the epidermis (Fig. ). These nests diffusely penetrated and infiltrated the surrounding tissues (Figure ). A junctional component was present, but scant. Abundant melanophages along with some pigment incontinence were present. The tumor cells were characterized by severe cytologic atypia and pleomorphism (Figure ) with occasional nuclear vacuoles and large pseudoinclusions (Figures , ).

542,1590043-1,16995951,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1590043.xml,A rare case of renal oncocytoma associated with erythrocytosis: case report,"A 41-year-old man presented in March 2005 to the internist due to frequent headaches and plethoric face. The CBC results showed a hematocrit of 65.1%. The number of red cells was elevated: 7,32 × 106/mm3. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was within normal levels: 88,9 fl. Oxygen saturation was 99%. The patient was a non-smoker. Hemoglobin was 21.7 g/dl, with all other hematological, biochemical and urine examinations being normal, apart from a small cholesterol (232 mg/dl) and GPT (72 U/L) level elevation. The patient was taking no medications and his medical and surgical history was clear.
Findings of the abdominal ultrasound examination were normal, apart from a solid mass on the lower pole of the right kidney, measuring 8.1 × 6.1 cm, with calcifications. The left kidney was normal. On subsequent CT and MRI examination this mass was enhancing. It measured 6 × 6 × 7 cm and the differential diagnosis included oncocytoma and renal cell carcinoma. There was evidence of a tumor pseudocapsule with similar uptake to that of the normal renal parenchyma and a central part showing homogeneously diminished contrast uptake. No central scar was detected. Furthermore, the mass appeared to distort the lower pole calyces of the right kidney. No renal vein invasion or lymph node enlargement was noted. Erythropoietin level was 17.4 mIU/ml (normal range: 9–26 mIU/ml).
Subsequently, after phlebotomy (twice) to prevent perioperative thrombotic complications, the patient was subjected to open partial nephrectomy via a flank approach. This decision was based on the fact that the patient was young and had a relatively higher probability to develop chronic renal insufficiency had he been subjected to radical nephrectomy. Another reason was the favorable peripheral location of the tumor and some recent evidence that tumors>4 cm can be treated by partial nephrectomy []. Macroscopically, the tumor demonstrated a brownish color. It was solid, well circumscribed and showed no areas of necrosis. A central scar was apparent on macroscopic examination. Microscopically, the tumor showed the morphological and immunohistochemical characters of oncocytoma (vimentin (-), CK7 (-), CD10 (+)).
The hematocrit levels dropped to normal levels in the perioperative period (probably due to phlebotomy and blood loss during the operation). Because of the need to closely follow his postoperative status, the patient was discharged from the hospital on the 11th postoperative day after an uneventful recovery period. On follow-up examination 1, 3 and 6 months later the hematocrit remained normal (42 to 43%, hemoglobin 14–14.5 g/dl) and after 9 months the hematocrit was 42.5%. Follow-up MRI at 9 months was normal and erythropoietin levels dropped to 14.5 mIU/ml one year after the operation.","[[41.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['face', 'abdominal', 'lower pole of the right kidney', 'left kidney', 'renal', 'renal parenchyma', 'lower pole calyces of the right kidney', 'renal vein', 'lymph node', 'flank', 'renal']","['headaches', 'plethoric face', 'non-smoker', 'solid mass', 'mass', 'calcifications', 'left kidney was normal', 'mass', 'oncocytoma', 'renal cell carcinoma', 'tumor pseudocapsule', 'normal renal parenchyma', 'contrast uptake', 'central scar', 'mass', 'renal vein invasion', 'lymph node enlargement', 'thrombotic complications', 'renal insufficiency', 'tumor', 'tumors', 'tumor', 'well circumscribed', 'necrosis', 'central scar', 'tumor', 'morphological and immunohistochemical characters of oncocytoma', 'hematocrit levels dropped to normal levels', 'blood loss']",[],"['41', 'March 2005', '11th']","['CBC', 'hematocrit', 'number of red cells', 'mean corpuscular volume', 'MCV', 'Oxygen saturation', 'Hemoglobin', 'hematological', 'biochemical', 'urine examinations', 'cholesterol', 'GPT', 'medications', 'abdominal ultrasound examination', 'CT', 'MRI', 'Erythropoietin level', 'phlebotomy', 'open partial nephrectomy', 'open partial nephrectomy via a flank approach', 'radical nephrectomy', 'partial nephrectomy', 'Macroscopically', 'macroscopic examination', 'Microscopically', 'vimentin', 'CK7', 'CD10', 'phlebotomy', 'operation', 'examination', 'hematocrit', 'hemoglobin', 'hematocrit', 'MRI', 'erythropoietin levels']","['perioperative', 'perioperative period', '1, 3 and 6 months', '9 months', 'one year after the operation']"

The patient initially underwent colonic transposition as a reconstruction followed by a delayed jejunal transposition due to the development of a 12 cm upper oesophageal corrosive stricture.
History and clinical examination revealed no history of further carcinoma; upper endoscopy and radiological examination revealed residual 8 cm upper oesophageal stricture and right recurrent laryngeal palsy.
The surgical access was through a previous pharyngectomy scar in the line of the right sternomastoid muscle with the raising of sub-platysmal flaps. Dissection continued to reveal the thyrocervical trunk and inferior thyroid artery with the excision of the previously fibrosed jejunal graft and the preparation of good vascular supply to the proximal jejunum. During which a generous cuff of muscosa was preserved with good exposure of the right piriform fossa and the remaining 8 cm gap from the pirifom fossa to the oesophagus.
An upper midline laparotomy was performed with local adhesionolysis. The second loop of the jejunum was identified and harvested on good arcade. The pedicle was ligated and remaining jejunal continiuity established and abdomen closed.
The free flap was transposed to the neck with posterior serosal layers to the proximal and distal ends in an iso-peristaltic fashion. A micro-vascular technique was used to create an end to end arterial anastomosis to the transverse cervical artery and an end to side venous anastomosis to the internal jugular vein.
Once good flow was confirmed (by microendoscopy) with satisfactory peristalsis and mucosal reaction the flap was further inset with proximal and distal fish mouthing techniques
An operating room Storz Hopkins II Forward oblique 30° microendoscope (4 mm diameter and 18 cm long) attached via a stroz fibre optic cable was connected to a three chip ""Olympus"" camera and video monitor. Photographs were taken using a ""Sony"" video photo-printer.
After suction clearance, the tip of the micro-endoscope was firmly applied to the area of interest to obtain an occlusive contact and then moved for dynamic assessment of the graft's vasculature and blood flow. Both the mucosal and serosal surfaces were examined at 10 randomly chosen sites to show qualitative blood flow in the graft. The examination was reproducible between operators. The depth of field was altered on the microendoscope to visualize the sub mucosal (Figure ) and sub serosal capillary networks (Figure ). Further direct microendoscopic monitoring of the mucosal surface was possible in the postoperative period.
Using this method we were able to directly visualise the flow of blood through the sub-mucosal capillary networks of the transferred free jejunal graft (Figures and ). This was further confirmed by direct intra-operative visualisation of the blood flow through the vasculature of the graft's serosal surface (Figure ). This method was used successfully to assess the viability of the flap.
Blood flow was seen to be pulsatile, with individual erythrocytes visible in the capillaries. The best view was obtained when the scope was focussed directly on the capillary rather than the graft surface (Figures and ). The view of the unstained mucosal surface was bland apart from the fine capillary loops which were seen to fill with each pulsatile event; two consecutive stills were taken to show the capillary loops filling with blood (Figure and ). Approximately three capillary loops were visible per high power view (×150). Between each pulse of blood flow the mucosal capillary loops were seen to collapse and reduce in visibility.
The microendoscopic examination of the serosal surface revealed much larger calibre vessels with obvious blood flow (Figure ). The serosal vessels were much easier to visualise and did not collapse between pulses although blood flow through them was seen to be pulsatile.
Microendoscopy was used intraoperatively in a few seconds to assess actual small capillary blood flow in addition to direct observation of the pedicle and edge bleeding. The flow of the erythrocytes can be observed and a time gated image analysis may allow an objective assessment of blood flow. The observations can occur in a real-time and continuous manner during the operation. Perhaps later differentiation of arterial or venous dominant occlusion may be possible through the assessment of oxygen carriage through flow colorimetry. Poor persistent blood flow may be an indication for early surgical intervention.","[[30.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['gastro-intestinal tract', 'colonic', 'jejunal', 'upper oesophageal', 'upper oesophageal', 'laryngeal', 'line of the right sternomastoid muscle', 'sub-platysmal flaps', 'thyrocervical trunk', 'inferior thyroid artery', 'jejunal', 'proximal jejunum', 'cuff of muscosa', 'right piriform fossa', 'pirifom fossa to the oesophagus', 'second loop of the jejunum', 'pedicle', 'jejunal', 'abdomen', 'neck', 'posterior serosal layers to the proximal and distal ends', 'arterial', 'transverse cervical artery', 'venous', 'internal jugular vein', 'mucosal', 'area of interest', 'vasculature', 'mucosal', 'serosal surfaces', '10 randomly chosen sites', 'sub mucosal', 'sub serosal capillary networks', 'mucosal surface', 'sub-mucosal capillary networks of the transferred free jejunal graft', ""vasculature of the graft's serosal surface"", 'capillaries', 'capillary', 'unstained mucosal surface', 'fine capillary loops', 'capillary', 'capillary loops', 'capillary loops', 'mucosal capillary loops', 'capillary loops', 'serosal surface', 'vessels', 'serosal vessels', 'capillary', 'pedicle', 'edge', 'arterial', 'venous']","['carcinoma', 'upper oesophageal corrosive stricture', 'carcinoma', 'upper oesophageal stricture', 'laryngeal palsy', 'surgical access', 'pharyngectomy scar', 'raising of sub-platysmal flaps', 'fibrosed jejunal graft', 'preparation of good vascular supply', 'generous cuff of muscosa was preserved', 'good exposure of the right piriform fossa', 'remaining 8 cm gap from the pirifom fossa to the oesophagus', 'jejunal continiuity', 'good flow', 'peristalsis', 'mucosal reaction', 'qualitative blood flow in the graft', 'flow of blood', 'blood flow', 'viability of the flap', 'Blood flow', 'erythrocytes', 'bland', 'fill with each pulsatile event', 'pulsatile event', 'capillary loops filling with blood', 'Between each pulse of blood flow', 'collapse', 'reduce in visibility', 'calibre vessels', 'blood flow', 'serosal vessels were much easier to visualise', 'collapse between pulses', 'blood flow through them was seen to be pulsatile', 'capillary blood flow', 'bleeding', 'flow of the erythrocytes', 'dominant occlusion', 'Poor persistent blood flow']",[],['30'],"['surgical interventions in the gastro-intestinal tract', 'colonic transposition', 'jejunal transposition', 'upper endoscopy', 'radiological examination', 'surgical access was through a previous pharyngectomy scar in the line of the right sternomastoid muscle with the raising of sub-platysmal flaps', 'Dissection continued to reveal the thyrocervical trunk and inferior thyroid artery', 'excision of the previously fibrosed jejunal graft', 'upper midline laparotomy', 'local adhesionolysis', 'second loop of the jejunum was identified and harvested on good arcade', 'pedicle was ligated', 'abdomen closed', 'free flap was transposed to the neck with posterior serosal layers to the proximal and distal ends in an iso-peristaltic fashion', 'micro-vascular technique was used to create an end to end arterial anastomosis to the transverse cervical artery and an end to side venous anastomosis to the internal jugular vein', 'microendoscopy', 'flap was further inset with proximal and distal fish mouthing techniques', 'suction clearance', 'tip of the micro-endoscope was firmly applied to the area of interest to obtain an occlusive contact', 'examination', 'microendoscopic monitoring of the mucosal surface', 'microendoscopic examination', 'microendoscopic examination of the serosal surface', 'Microendoscopy', 'time gated image analysis', 'blood flow', 'oxygen carriage through flow colorimetry', 'surgical intervention']","['postoperative period', 'intra-operative', 'intraoperatively']"

Initial examination revealed visual acuity in the right eye – 6/9, in the left – finger counting. Conjunctival chemosis was present in the left eye, posterior synechiae and a cloudy vitreous with no fundal view.
Ocular ultrasound and vitreal biopsy (no growth) enabled a diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis to be made.

She was referred to hospital with presumed ischaemic cardiac pain. On arrival in hospital she had a normal electrocardiograph and chest radiograph, however the pain was unremitting. With the exception of hypertension, physical examination was unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiogram indicated the presence of a dissection flap in the ascending aorta, which was subsequently confirmed with contrast enhanced computerised tomography (CT) of the chest (figure ). The full extent of the dissection was from the aortic valve to just beyond the left subclavian artery, and the peri-aortic haematoma appeared to be compressing the right pulmonary artery.
Following admission to our institution the patient was transferred to the operating theatre emergently and underwent aortic valve replacement (21 mm Perimount Magna, Edwards Lifesciences, CA, USA) and interposition graft replacement of the ascending aorta (30 mm Haemashield, Boston Scientific, MA, USA), reinforced with felt strips. This was done without circulatory arrest, with the aortic remnant wrapped around the graft. Weaning off bypass was difficult due to high venous and low systemic arterial filling pressures, and the main pulmonary artery (PA) was noticed to be very tense. A trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) suggested the presence of thrombus within the main PA. The main PA was opened and revealed no intraluminal thrombus. However there was a mass compressing the PA posteriorly. This compression was overcome by widening the PA using a bovine pericardium patch (GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK), the subsequent appearance on TEE being much improved. The patient was successfully weaned off bypass and transferred to the intensive care unit. However, twelve hours post-operatively the patient became increasingly hypoxic with a respiratory acidosis, and haemodynamically unstable requiring increasing levels of inotropic support. These features were suggestive of an acute pulmonary embolus. A contrast enhanced CT scan of the chest showed an occlusion of the right PA (figure ), similar to what was seen intra-operatively with TEE. However the poor clinical status of the patient precluded any consideration of surgical thrombectomy or stent placement within the PA. The patient eventually died 24 hours post surgery.
The post mortem examination confirmed that the aortic valve, interposition graft, and PA patch were correctly placed.

There was no family history of colorectal neoplasia. There was an attendant history of perianal discharge for the previous 2 years and the patient volunteered that he had been seen in the United Kingdom and told that he had a perianal fistula in 1999. Clinical examination was unremarkable apart from the perianal area where a perianal fistula was evident which appeared to be low trans-sphincteric in nature. It was firm and indurated. A barium enema which had been performed outside the hospital showed an annular stenosing lesion of the rectosigmoid. Preoperative CT scan confirmed the colonic lesion but was otherwise unremarkable. In view of the presentation he was taken to the operating theatre after full bowel preparation for elective sigmoid colectomy and wide fistula excision.
Histology of the colon showed a moderate to well differentiated adenocarcinoma with extensive mucinous components and none out of 10 lymph nodes resected was involved with tumour. (Stage IIA American Joint Committee Cancer) The resection margins of the tumour were clear. The fistula also showed a similar histology (Figure ) with clear resection margins, involving the lower internal and external anal sphincter muscles associated with free floating dissociated tumour cells lying within lakes of mucin evident some distance from the epithelial lining. (Figure ) The postoperative course of the patient was unremarkable and he has since undergone sandwich chemoradiotherapy utilizing 3 cycles of 5-Fluorouracil (425 mg/m2) and leucovorin (20 mg/m2) before and after 4500 cGy external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the perineum and inguinal portals.

Two weeks prior to admission she had been on a holiday in southwest Africa. After three days in the hot climate there, she developed tiredness and fatigue with profuse vomiting. In hospital, routine bloods showed low sodium less than 100 mmol/l and raised potassium at 5.9 mmol/l. Other routine blood parameters were normal and random cortisol was low at 136 nmol/l.
Using intravenous normal saline, she was started on gradual sodium replacement aiming at 8 mmol/l correction per day with daily electrolyte monitoring. The sodium improved to 130 mmol/l over 5 days. Over the next week she developed dysarthria and ataxia with rigidity and tremor. MRI showed faint symmetrical change laterally in the basal ganglia that were not felt to be significant.
With a deteriorating condition and no clear diagnosis, she was flown back to the UK as an emergency for assessment at our tertiary neurological centre.
She had been diagnosed with coeliac disease at the age of 14 and maintained close dietary control. Two months prior to her holiday, she was found to have hypothyroidism and had been started on thyroxine 25 mcg once a day. There was no other past medical or surgical history.
On examination she was slim and under-nourished with a noticeable tan. She was afebrile and pulse and blood pressure were normal. Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examinations were normal. Glasgow coma scale was 14/15. She was unable to speak, but was responding to questions with grunting and communicating with great difficulty using a finger-board.
The cranial nerves and fundus were normal. Tone was uniformly increased with cogwheel rigidity and tremor. Remaining neurological examination was normal.
The blood tests were normal on admission including the hepatic and renal functions. Sodium was 135 and potassium 3.9.
Thyroid functions were normal and thyroid peroxidase antibody was negative. The serum cortisol was low at 83 nmol/l and glucose was normal. A synacthen test was diagnostic of Addison's disease and her adrenal antibodies were positive. So, Addison's disease, exacerbated by dehydration and vomiting, had been the cause for her hyponatraemia.
Chest Xray, ECG and CT Scan of brain were normal.
At this stage, a metabolic insult to the brain due to osmotic shift during correction of hyponatraemia was thought of clinically and an MRI scan was requested.
MRI following transfer showed symmetrical hyperintensity on the T2-weighted images within the caudate and putamen (Fig ) and in FLAIR T2 images (Fig ). There were absolutely no changes within the pons in T2-weighted images (Fig ). These changes did not show marked progression in comparison with the MR done soon after the metabolic insult. There were no changes within the globus pallidus, cerebellum or within cerebral white matter.
She was treated with hydrocortisone 200 mg tds intravenously and thyroxine 100 mcg daily. Fludrocortisone was subsequently added. Her neurological symptoms were controlled with Baclofen 20 mg bd and LevoDopa/carbidopa 100/25 mg tds. She improved markedly and levodopa therapy was no longer required after day 10. Baclofen was also withdrawn and she returned to work within 2 months.

He was followed-up with annual head and orbital CT scans for 15 years with no signs of loco-regional recurrence. Five years after discharge from follow-up, he presented with a 3-month history of right upper quadrant pain, radiating to his back, associated with shortness of breath and reduced exercise tolerance.
Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly and right upper quadrant tenderness, but no stigmata of chronic liver disease. Head and neck examination revealed no sign of local recurrence. LFT, inflammatory markers, coagulation profile, CEA, CA 19-9, and AFP were all normal. An abdominal ultrasound (USS) examination and subsequent chest and abdominal CT scan showed a large 15 × 17 × 20 cm heterogeneous mass with a central area of low attenuation suggesting necrosis involving segments 4 to 8 of the liver (Figure ), partially occluding the right portal vein. No lung or bone metastases were identified.
The patient was otherwise fit with no other significant past medical history. After discussion at our multidisciplinary meeting the patient was offered surgery. At operation, the tumour was found to infiltrate the right hemi diaphragm, which was locally excised en bloc with the extended right hemihepatectomy. The postoperative course was unremarkable and he was discharged 7 days after surgery.

She was treated with external beam radiotherapy to 60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks in accordance to ICRU-50. Two lateral parallel opposed fields were used to treat the nasopharynx and upper neck. The lower neck was irradiated with a direct anterior field with a central cord shield and a lower border just below clavicular heads. The junction of the upper and lower field was at the level of hyoid bone. It was followed by a 10 Gy Iridium-192 brachytherapy boost to the nasopharynx. Treatment was completed in May 1994. She remained well with no further recurrence of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma but developed xerostomia and mild fibrosis of the lower neck.
She re-presented in December 1999 with a mass in the left supraclavicular fossa and numbness in the arm, but no motor weakness. The mass was located within the area previously irradiated to 60 Gy. Her disease was staged with our standard protocol at the time with MRI of the neck and shoulder, CT of the chest and functional imaging using thallium-201 scintigraphy []. MRI showed a 3 cm × 5 cm mass involving the brachial plexus (Figure ). Open biopsy confirmed pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma.
The management of her case was discussed in our multi-disciplinary meeting. The agreed treatment plan was preoperative radiotherapy followed by en bloc resection. She received an accelerated hyperfractionated course of radiotherapy 48 Gy in 40 fractions (ICRU-50), treating twice a day over four weeks. The radiation field incorporated the brachial plexus and used 6 MV photons in an anterior-weighted, opposed oblique arrangement avoiding the spinal cord. Radiotherapy was completed in February 2000. Restaging investigations showed that the lesion had become more cystic on MRI, but its size had not changed. The degree of thallium-201 scintigraphy uptake had not changed significantly either. The patient proceeded on to surgery four weeks later.
Surgery in March 2000 consisted of en bloc resection of the tumor along with the left sternomastoid and superior and middle trunks of the brachial plexus. Clavicular osteotomy was necessary to allow dissection of the tumor from the subclavian vessels. Sural nerve grafts were used to restore continuity of nerve supply from C5 and C6 to the suprascapular, musculocutaneous and axillary nerves. A latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap was raised to close the defect in the neck. The middle third of the clavicle that had been reflected downwards was replaced and secured with a plate and screws.
Histological examination of the surgical specimen showed evidence of radiotherapy, with large areas of necrosis and hemorrhage seen both macroscopically and microscopically. Comparison was made between the operative specimen and the pre-irradiation biopsy; necrosis was not seen in the pre-irradiation specimen (Figures and ). Surgical excision appeared complete.
Immediate postoperative recovery was uncomplicated. The patient retained good function in her hand but was left with a flail shoulder and no power in elbow flexion. She thus underwent cable grafting of the musculocutaneous nerve in October 2000, with gradual return of elbow function following this procedure.
The patient presented again in December 2001 with pain in the shoulder. X-ray confirmed that there had been non-union of the osteopaenic clavicle, the plate having detached from the lateral end of the clavicle. She returned to theatre and had a bone graft and internal fixation (Figure ). Following this procedure, pain settled and she continues to have good use of her arm, although shoulder movement remains minimal.
The patient remains well five years after combined therapy for the PRS, with no evidence of recurrence of either her nasopharyngeal carcinoma or the PRS. The patient had no lymphoedema, neurovascular, severe fibrosis or other significant late effect as a result of re-irradiation.","[[59.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['nasopharyngeal', 'Two lateral parallel opposed fields', 'nasopharynx', 'upper neck', 'lower neck', 'central cord shield', 'lower border just below clavicular heads', 'junction of the upper and lower field', 'level of hyoid bone', 'nasopharynx', 'nasopharyngeal', 'lower neck', 'left supraclavicular fossa', 'arm', 'within the area', 'neck', 'shoulder', 'chest', 'brachial plexus', 'brachial plexus', 'spinal cord', 'left sternomastoid', 'superior and middle trunks of the brachial plexus', 'Clavicular', 'subclavian vessels', 'Sural nerve', 'C5 and C6', 'suprascapular', 'musculocutaneous', 'axillary nerves', 'latissimus dorsi myocutaneous', 'neck', 'middle third of the clavicle', 'hand', 'shoulder', 'elbow', 'musculocutaneous nerve', 'elbow', 'shoulder', 'osteopaenic clavicle', 'lateral end of the clavicle', 'bone', 'arm', 'shoulder', 'nasopharyngeal', 'neurovascular']","['nasopharyngeal carcinoma', 'remained well', 'nasopharyngeal carcinoma', 'xerostomia', 'fibrosis of the lower neck', 'mass', 'numbness', 'motor weakness', 'mass', 'disease', 'mass', 'pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma', 'lesion', 'size had not changed', 'changed significantly', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'radiotherapy', 'necrosis', 'hemorrhage', 'necrosis', 'Immediate postoperative recovery was uncomplicated', 'retained good function', 'flail shoulder', 'power', 'power in elbow flexion', 'elbow function', 'pain', 'non-union of the osteopaenic clavicle', 'plate having detached from the lateral end of the clavicle', 'pain', 'good use of her arm', 'shoulder movement remains minimal', 'remains well', 'PRS', 'nasopharyngeal carcinoma', 'PRS', 'lymphoedema', 'fibrosis', 'late effect']",[],"['59', 'centre', '1994', 'ICRU', 'May 1994', 'December 1999', 'February 2000', 'March 2000', 'October 2000', 'December 2001']","['external beam radiotherapy', 'lower neck was irradiated with a direct anterior field with a central cord shield and a lower border just below clavicular heads', 'Iridium-192 brachytherapy boost', 'Treatment', 'irradiated', 'MRI of the neck and shoulder', 'CT of the chest', 'functional imaging using thallium-201 scintigraphy', 'MRI', 'Open biopsy', 'radiotherapy', 'en bloc resection', 'accelerated hyperfractionated course of radiotherapy', 'radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy', 'MRI', 'degree of thallium-201 scintigraphy uptake', 'surgery', 'Surgery', 'en bloc resection of the tumor along with the left sternomastoid and superior and middle trunks of the brachial plexus', 'Clavicular osteotomy', 'dissection of the tumor from the subclavian vessels', 'Sural nerve grafts were used to restore continuity of nerve supply from C5 and C6 to the suprascapular, musculocutaneous and axillary nerves', 'latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap was raised to close the defect in the neck', 'middle third of the clavicle that had been reflected downwards was replaced and secured with a plate and screws', 'Histological examination', 'pre-irradiation biopsy', 'Surgical excision', 'cable grafting of the musculocutaneous nerve', 'procedure', 'X-ray', 'bone graft and internal fixation', 'procedure', 'combined therapy', 're-irradiation']","['May 1994', 'December 1999', 'December 1999', 'preoperative', 'February 2000', 'four weeks later', 'March 2000', 'October 2000', 'December 2001', 'five years']"

The pitchfork was observed to be contaminated with cow manure and hay. The knee was washed with soap and water. The following morning the knee was swollen and the boy was treated with orally administered antibiotics.
The mobility of the knee progressively decreased, and four days later the child was admitted to the hospital. Bacterial cultures of joint fluid yielded Bacillus and Enterococcus species. After a brief course of intravenous antibiotic therapy, the boy was discharged to continue orally administered antibiotics. At home, he developed increasing knee pain with inability to walk. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) obtained at transfer to our institution was consistent with infection involving the synovium, the medial femoral condyle and adjacent articular cartilage. Intravenous antibacterial therapy was instituted with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin.
Twenty seven days after the initial pitchfork injury, the patient was returned to the operating room because of persistent leg and knee swelling as well as increasing elevation of inflammatory markers with an ESR of >100 and a CRP of 6.5. An MRI revealed apparent osteomyelitis of the medial femoral condyle. New bone cultures were obtained which grew what was initially identified as a dermatophyte. Orally administered terbinafine, 125 mg (6.7 mg/kg) daily, was initiated, and the patient began to improve clinically. His CRP declined to a nadir of 1.8 with absence of fever and better movement of his leg. However, 45 days following the initial injury and 14 days after wound closure, an elevation in the CRP to 2.6, as well as an increase of purulent drainage from the knee prompted another surgical exploration of the distal femur and the addition of intravenous Ambisome, 90 mg (4.8 mg/kg) daily. At surgery, progressive bone loss was noted as well as necrosis of knee cartilage. Fungal organisms with irregular branching hyphae were noted throughout the excised cartilage, and fungus was recovered in culture two weeks later.
Meanwhile, the fungal agent that had been isolated previously was forwarded to the Fungus Testing Laboratory at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio for identification and susceptibility testing and accessioned into their stock collection as UTHSC 05-3365. There, the organism was identified as Myceliophthora thermophila, based upon observation of: 1) tan to brown powdery colonies with ill-defined margins when grown on potato flakes agar at 42°C; 2) more luxuriant growth at elevated temperatures of 35°C and 42°C than at 26°C; 3) septate vegetative hyphae with conidial production from ampulliform swellings; and 4) obovoid (inverted egg shaped) or pyriform (pear-shaped) conidia measuring 4.5–11.0 × 3.0–4.5 μm that were hyaline and smooth when immature, becoming darker and roughened at maturity (Figure ). Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M38-A document for filamentous fungi []. Although standardized susceptibility breakpoints have not been established for this organism, the isolate appeared resistant to a variety of standard antifungal agents (Table ). Based upon these susceptibilities, voriconazole (4 mg/kg/12 hrs after a loading dose of 6 mg/kg/12 hrs for 24 hours) was added to the patient's antifungal regimen, and Ambisome was discontinued. Subsequently, the patient underwent numerous debridement procedures with gradual improvement in clinical picture and CRP. A series of progressive increases in voriconazole dosage was required based upon periodic pharmacokinetic studies to achieve appropriate blood levels (Table ).
After his CRP had normalized, the patient was discharged home receiving voriconazole, 250 mg (13.4 mg/kg) orally, every 12 hours, and terbinafine 125 mg (6.7 mg/kg) orally once daily. Anti-fungal therapy is to be continued for a total of one year.

Barium swallow showed an extrinsic compression of the lower thoracic esophagus. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, which revealed a large submucosal mass in the lower thoracic esophagus without mucosal irregularity. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed a large homogeneous tumor in the esophageal muscular layer, measuring about 5 × 6 cm, without paraesophageal lymph nodes and projecting into the right pleural cavity (Figure ). Routine laboratory and clinical findings were normal.
The patient was intubated with a double lumen tube for one-lung ventilation and was positioned in the left lateral decubitus position. Three thoracic trocars were introduced (Figure ). The camera port (10-mm) was placed at the ninth intercostal space, mid-axillary line. Two 5-mm trocars were introduced at the fifth intercostal space, anterior axillary line and the seventh intercostal space, posterior axillary line for using a ""grasper"" or coagulating device. The left lung was retracted to expose the lower thoracic esophagus. A simple hook was used to divide the mediastinal pleura overlying the esophagus. The lesion was then enucleated by careful dissection.
Intraoperative endoscopy with air insufflation was performed to confirm esophageal integrity (Figure ). The esophageal muscle was re-approximated with interrupted 3/0 Dexon. The specimen was removed within an endobag through the camera port. A 28 Fr chest tube was inserted through the camera port for postoperative drainage. The operative time was 2 hours and intraoperative blood loss was minimal.
Barium swallow at day 3 after surgery revealed no leakage and the patient was started on a liquid diet on day 4.

By inference, she was infected with P.falciparum either alone or mixed with another Plasmodium species. She self-prescribed oral artemether, obtaining the drug from the NGOs pharmacy. She did not recall the dose of artemether, but she reported full compliance with the five days course contained in the package. She improved on this treatment, but four days after stopping artemether, she developed fever again and had a positive malaria blood smear (species and parasitaemia unknown) consistent with a recrudescence of her primary infection. She was retreated with the same five days regimen with good effect. Some three and a half weeks later, she suffered a recurrence of fever associated with a positive malaria smear (species and parasitaemia unknown) suggesting either a recrudescence of her initial infection or a new infection. PCR genotyping was unavailable to differentiate her recurrent illness.

He took weekly mefloquine as prophylaxis and reported good compliance. However, he developed an acute febrile illness that was diagnosed as malaria by blood smear. He was unaware of the Plasmodium species but, considering the local malaria epidemiology, it was almost certainly P. falciparum. A local physician treated him with oral artesunate for three days and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, as a single dose of three tablets, with good effect. He did not recall the dose of artesunate but it was probably either 50 mg bid or 100 mg bid on the first day followed by 50 mg twice a day, consistent with the artesunate formulations likely to be available locally. However, 14 days after as the last dose of artesunate, he presented in Geneva with fever and his blood slide was positive for P.falciparum with an asexual parasitaemia of 190,000/μL, consistent with a probable recrudescence of his primary illness rather than a new infection (PCR unavailable). He was cured with the six doses regimen of artemether/lumefantrine.
In summary, these three non-immune expatriate workers suffered of probable falciparum malaria treatment failure after initial diagnosis and artemisinin-based treatment in Africa. It must be emphasized that the initial diagnosis could not be ascertained as malaria blood slides were not available for quality control. Considering the great variability in quality of diagnostic procedures in African laboratories, local diagnosis of malaria may not always be accurate.
All patients reported having completed their treatment without episode of vomiting. The early timings of their recurrent malaria are consistent with recrudescence, but in the absence of PCR genotyping the possibility of early reinfections cannot be definitively excluded. Similarly, in the absence of defined plasmatic drug levels, none of these patients' recurrences meets the WHO definition of drug resistance []. Sub-optimal drug dosing is the likely explanation for the treatment failures in all three patients. Patient 1 took artemether for an inadequate duration (five days only) and suffered recurrent malaria four days after completing her treatment. Patient 2 failed with the four dose regimen of artemether/lumefantrine, an expected finding in non-immunes []. Patient 3 had probably taken insufficient artesunate during the first three days. His total dose was probably either 400 mg (200 mg day 1, 100 mg days 2 & 3) or 300 (100 mg/d) mg. These doses translate to a mean of 1.9 and 1.4 mg/kg daily, respectively, and are less than half of the current recommendation of 4 mg/kg (~300 mg for a 70 kg man) of artesunate daily when used in combination. However, the failure to clear parasites following an adult dose of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (S/P) is consistent with S/P resistance.

555,1601950-1,17020609,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1601950.xml,Bilateral spontaneous hemotympanum: Case report,"A 72-year-old male presented in the emergency ward with acute deterioration of hearing, which occurred during the past 24 hours. In the patient's past medical history aortic valve replacement in May 2004, 1 year before presentation was reported. Since then he had been administered on a regular basis coumarinic anticoagulants. His INR (International Normalized Ratio) levels were routinely checked every month and until presentation INR levels between 3.4 and 4.0 were maintained. The latest INR value obtained 2 weeks before the acute deterioration of hearing was 3.6.
Otolaryngologic clinical evaluation, including microscopy of the ear, revealed the presence of bilateral hemotympanum (Fig. ). The tympanic membrane was intact but immobile during the Valsalva maneuver. Other findings were unremarkable and clinical examination proved absence of any other abnormal bleeding on the skin and mucosae. The patient did not mention any abnormal bleeding or bruising in the past. Additionally, the patient's history was clear from chronic middle ear problems or any underlying systemic disorder associated with defective hemostasis and from recent activities related with barotrauma, such as diving, air travel or Valsalva maneuvers. Also, he did not report systemic use of salicylates or any other drugs which could possibly interfere with coagulation, other than the coumarinic anticoagulants. However, the patient mentioned an overdose of nimesulid 2 days ago, for an unrelated reason.
An audiogram was obtained, which showed symmetrical moderately severe mixed hearing loss bilaterally, with the conductive component predominating. The air-bone gap for the right ear was 45 dB at 0.25 kHz, 35 dB at 0.5 kHz, 40 dB at 1 kHz, 35 dB at 2 kHz and 25 dB at 4 kHz. The corresponding values for the left ear were 40 dB, 35 dB, 35 dB, 35 dB and 20 dB. Tympanometry revealed flat tympanograms (type B) bilaterally and absence of acoustic reflexes both ipsi- and contralaterally. A computerized tomography (CT) scan was ordered, which showed the presence of fluid in the mastoid and middle ear bilaterally (Fig. ).
Treatment was conservative. A course of antibiotics taken orally was administered for 10 days, in conjunction with anticongestants. Additionally, we advised temporary interruption of the anticoagulant therapy. The patient had a follow-up otolaryngologic examination after 3 weeks, during which we found that the tympanic membranes were mobile and normal in appearance. Audiometric evaluation showed that hearing had returned to previous levels and acoustic immittance measures were normal. After consultation with the patient's cardiologist, coumarinic anticoagulants were administered again, but in lower doses to maintain INR levels between 2.0 and 3.0. The patient has been followed-up for 6 months at our clinic, and his state is steady, without any new symptoms or signs of bleeding.
Hemotympanum may be easily diagnosed by otoscopy, appearing as partial or total occupancy of the tympanic membrane by bright red, or purple – dark blue colour. The bright red colour of the tympanic membrane is hypothesized to be secondary to oxygen-rich blood owed to recent hemorrhage, whereas the dark colour may originate from oxygen-poor blood from a middle ear effusion or basilar skull fracture []. The tympanic cavity derives a rich arterial supply from a number of superficial vessels originating from the external carotid artery [], which may bleed under certain circumstances.
Hemotympanum may be produced by various causes. Thus, it is important to obtain a detailed medical history from the patient in order to detect the underlying pathology, so that this disorder may be treated properly. The most commonly reported cause of hemotympanum is head trauma []. A fracture of the temporal bone, usually resulting from blunt head injury, can produce hemotympanum and hearing loss that can be either conductive, sensorineural or mixed. The conductive element is usually owed to the presence of blood, which may fill the tympanic cavity. Hearing is restored as soon as the blood is absorbed. However, in cases of persistent hearing loss, ossicular disruption may be present.
Occasionally, hemotympanum secondary to therapeutic nasal packing or spontaneous epistaxis was reported [,]. Eustachian tube dysfunction is hypothesized to be the cause of this disorder on both occasions, with peritubal lymphatic stasis the most probable pathogenetic mechanism []. In cases of epistaxis without nasal packing, retrograde reflux of blood through a patulous Eustachian tube may be implicated [].
Several other rare causes of hemotympanum should be also considered. In advanced tuberculosis blood may penetrate into the middle ear during haemoptysis []. Barotrauma of the middle ear is another possible cause of hemotympanum. The most common causes of barotrauma today are from the use of the Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA), air travel, and from hyperbaric oxygen chambers. Edmonds from the Australian Diving Medical Center [], devised a grading system for middle ear barotrauma, based on the otoscopic appearance of the tympanic membrane. The grading scale is from Grade 0, when a patient experiences symptoms of middle ear barotrauma but no physical findings are present, to Grade V, when a perforation of the tympanic membrane is apparent. Hemotympanum, evidenced by blueness and bulging of the tympanic membrane, represents Grade IV in this scale.
In patients who are on anticoagulants or suffer from leukaemia, spontaneous bleeding within the temporal bone may also occur []. In our patient regular uptake of anticoagulants was most probably the cause of spontaneous bilateral hemotympanum. To our knowledge such a case has never been reported in the literature so far. Uptake of nimesulide might be an aggravating factor for the clinical manifestation of this condition. Antiinflammatory drugs are known to interfere with blood coagulation. Although evidence is still inconclusive, it appears that nimesulide may inhibit platelet aggregation and, additionally, may inhibit thromboxane A2 formation by platelets at low concentration []. It has been reported that although nimesulide does not usually affect the response to coumarin anticoagulants, a few patients may show some increase in anticoagulant effect [].
In all cases, differential diagnosis between secondary and idiopathic hemotympanum should be made. The latter is associated with the presence of cholesterol granuloma derived from granulomatosus mastoiditis and is characterized by purple colour of the tympanic membrane []. Cholesterol granuloma can be diagnosed by MRI, as it has a characteristic appearance in T1- and T2- weighed images. Main et al. [] have produced successfully cholesterol granuloma in monkeys under persistent obstruction of the Eustachian tube.
Treatment of hemotympanum should be, initially, conservative. Myringotomy and insertion of a ventilation tube is indicated for treatment when the condition persists after one month []. In these cases, the presence of a glomus tumor, either involving the jugular bulb (glomus jugulare) or confined to the middle ear or mastoid (glomus tympanicum), should be considered []. Clinical detection of this disorder is often difficult, and usually, contrast-enhanced CT scans in conjunction with angiography are needed.
In our patient treatment was conservative. Additionally, we ordered termination of the anticoagulant administration for a short period of time and prescribed a course of antibiotics and nasal anticongestants until the absorption of blood. Resolution was observed after 3 weeks, so that adjunctive therapeutic measures were not necessary.","[[72.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['aortic valve', 'ear', 'tympanic membrane', 'skin', 'mucosae', 'middle ear', 'air-bone', 'right ear', 'left ear', 'mastoid', 'middle ear', 'tympanic membranes', 'tympanic membrane', 'tympanic membrane', 'middle ear', 'basilar skull', 'tympanic cavity', 'arterial', 'number of superficial vessels', 'external carotid artery', 'head', 'temporal bone', 'head', 'tympanic cavity', 'ossicular', 'nasal', 'Eustachian tube', 'peritubal lymphatic', 'nasal', 'patulous Eustachian tube', 'middle ear', 'middle ear', 'middle ear', 'tympanic membrane', 'middle ear', 'tympanic membrane', 'tympanic membrane', 'temporal bone', 'tympanic membrane', 'Eustachian tube', 'glomus', 'jugular bulb', 'glomus jugulare', 'middle ear', 'mastoid', 'glomus tympanicum', 'nasal']","['deterioration of hearing', 'bilateral hemotympanum', 'immobile', 'unremarkable', 'abnormal bleeding', 'abnormal bleeding', 'bleeding', 'bruising', 'middle ear problems', 'systemic disorder', 'defective hemostasis', 'barotrauma', 'systemic use of salicylates or any other drugs', 'interfere with coagulation', 'overdose of nimesulid', 'mixed hearing loss bilaterally', 'conductive component predominating', 'flat tympanograms (type B) bilaterally', 'acoustic reflexes', 'fluid', 'mobile', 'normal in appearance', 'hearing had returned to previous levels', 'state is steady', 'symptoms', 'bleeding', 'Hemotympanum', 'partial or total occupancy of the tympanic membrane', 'bright red colour of the tympanic membrane', 'oxygen-rich blood', 'hemorrhage', 'dark colour', 'oxygen-poor blood', 'middle ear effusion', 'basilar skull fracture', 'rich arterial supply', 'bleed', 'Hemotympanum', 'disorder', 'hemotympanum', 'head trauma', 'fracture of the temporal bone', 'blunt head injury', 'hemotympanum', 'hearing loss', 'conductive element', 'presence of blood', 'fill the tympanic cavity', 'Hearing is restored', 'blood is absorbed', 'hearing loss', 'ossicular disruption', 'hemotympanum', 'therapeutic nasal packing', 'epistaxis', 'Eustachian tube dysfunction', 'disorder', 'peritubal lymphatic stasis', 'pathogenetic mechanism', 'epistaxis', 'retrograde reflux of blood', 'hemotympanum', 'tuberculosis blood', 'haemoptysis', 'Barotrauma of the middle ear', 'hemotympanum', 'barotrauma', 'middle ear barotrauma', 'middle ear barotrauma', 'perforation of the tympanic membrane', 'Hemotympanum', 'blueness', 'bulging', 'leukaemia', 'spontaneous bleeding', 'bleeding', 'regular uptake of anticoagulants', 'bilateral hemotympanum', 'Uptake of nimesulide', 'interfere with blood coagulation', 'inhibit platelet aggregation', 'inhibit thromboxane A2 formation by platelets at low concentration', 'affect the response to coumarin anticoagulants', 'increase in anticoagulant effect', 'idiopathic hemotympanum', 'cholesterol granuloma', 'granulomatosus mastoiditis', 'purple colour of the tympanic membrane', 'Cholesterol granuloma', 'cholesterol granuloma', 'obstruction of the Eustachian tube', 'condition persists', 'glomus tumor', 'disorder', 'absorption of blood']","['nimesulid', 'nimesulide', 'nimesulide']","['72', 'emergency ward', 'May 2004', 'Australian Diving Medical Center']","['aortic valve replacement', 'coumarinic anticoagulants', 'INR (International Normalized Ratio) levels', 'INR levels', 'INR', 'microscopy of the ear', 'clinical examination', 'coumarinic anticoagulants', 'audiogram', 'air-bone gap', 'Tympanometry', 'computerized tomography (CT) scan', 'Treatment', 'antibiotics', 'anticongestants', 'anticoagulant therapy', 'otolaryngologic examination', 'Audiometric evaluation', 'acoustic immittance measures', 'coumarinic anticoagulants', 'INR levels', 'otoscopy', 'nasal packing', 'nasal packing', 'anticoagulants', 'anticoagulants', 'Antiinflammatory drugs', 'MRI', 'Treatment of hemotympanum', 'Myringotomy', 'insertion of a ventilation tube', 'treatment', 'contrast-enhanced CT scans', 'angiography', 'treatment', 'anticoagulant', 'antibiotics', 'nasal anticongestants', 'adjunctive therapeutic measures']","['past 24 hours', 'May 2004,', 'in the past', 'in the past', '2 days ago', 'after 3 weeks', 'after one month']"

She had excision of a right chest wall malignant melanoma Clark's level IV (1.18 mm maximum thickness) eight years prior. There were no palpable axillary nodes at that time. Mammogram, ultrasound and fine needle aspiration cytology of the breast lump confirmed breast cancer. Core biopsy of the right axillary lymph node showed high grade malignancy including pigmented cells, possibly originating from the malignant melanoma.

Examination revealed tachycardia, a loud pansystolic murmur along left sternal edge and bilateral basal crackles. Chest x-ray suggested pulmonary oedema. ECG demonstrated ST elevation in leads 1, AVL, V1–V5. He was thrombolysed with streptokinase. Transthoracic echo revealed an apicoanterior VSD with a significant shunt and akinesia of the anterior left ventricular wall. Coronary angiography demonstrated normal left main stem, occlusion of LAD just beyond the first septal and first diagonal (figs and ), and normally distributed and disease free circumflex and right coronary arteries. RCA was a normal sized vessel which supplied PDA which fell short of the apex. Circumflex artery, too, was a normal sized vessel with an average sized OM branch. The first diagonal was a good sized vessel which reached almost ¾ of the way down to apex. He was diagnosed to have anteroseptal myocardial infarction secondary to an occluded LAD, and a large anteroapical VSD. An IABP was introduced percutaneously. He continued to deteriorate clinically and became anuric and went into shock. On emergency median sternotomy on 7/6/99, the operative findings included hemopericardium, large anteroapical infarct of LV and anterior surface of RV, free wall rupture of infarcted RV wall just below RVOT and large 3 cm VSD in the anterior septum. Under CP bypass, moderate hypothermia and antegrade cardioplegic arrest, left ventriculotomy was made lateral to the diagonal branch of LAD. The septal myocardium surrounding the VSD was necrotic and mushy. The VSD was closed using a Teflon patch using interrupted pledgetted sutures placed well beyond the unhealthy septal myocardium surrounding the VSD in the inferior half and incorporating the superior half in sutures used for LV closure, which was done in two layers using Teflon bolsters on either side of ventriculotomy. The ruptured infarcted area of RV was incorporated in the suture line with the suture for ventriculotomy closure coming out well beyond the macroscopically identifiable right limit of RV infarction. All sutures in septum, left ventricle and right ventricle were placed through grossly uninfarcted myocardium. The distal half of the diagonal branch had to be incorporated in the ventriculotomy repair as it was involved in the infarcted myocardium. Bypass was discontinued easily in sinus rhythm on a small dose of ionotropes and IABP. Postoperative echo on 8/6/99 showed no residual VSD. He made satisfactory progress and was transferred to the ward on 6th postop day and went home on 17/6/99, 10 days following his surgery.
He represented on 14/7/99, 5 weeks after his previous VSD repair, from which he had been making satisfactory progress at home, with a 3 day history of progressively worsening shortness of breath. Clinical picture was that of pulmonary edema. TTE showed large VSD with 3:1 L-R shunt and moderate left ventricular function. He was taken to theatre and IABP introduced percutaneously through right groin. Femorofemoral bypass was instituted through left groin and patient cooled to 17°C. Secondary median sternotomy was made and heart dissected out with considerable difficulty. Aorta was not cross clamped and the previous ventriculotomy was reopened with the heart in VF. There was a recurrent VSD occupying a position inferoposterior to the Teflon patch with a serpiginous extension of septal infarct inferiorly and posteriorly over a wide area well beyond what was seen at the first operation, extending almost to the inlet of the trabecular septum. This was repaired using a much larger Teflon patch, anchoring the superior margin of the patch to the inferior margin of the previous patch and stitching the inferior margin well beyond the infarcted septum. This effectively excluded the entire area of the infarcted septum well beyond the VSD. The anterior wall of right ventricle in its left half was scarred and thinned out. Ventriculotomy was closed in two layers patient rewarmed, and bypass discontinued after heart defibrillated spontaneously into sinus rhythm. Postoperative echo on 21/07/99 showed a small L-R shunt and significantly impaired biventricular function. Despite this patient made a surprisingly quick recovery and was transferred to the ward on day 4 and home on 30/07/99.
On 06/08/99 he represented to the Accident and Emergency with a 4 cm subcutaneous swelling in the lower part of the sternal wound. This was incised, a small amount of pus drained which was sent for bacterial culture and the wound managed with daily dressings. On 11/08/99 when he was making preparations for his discharge, he suddenly collapsed after a bout of exsanguinating haemorrhage from the lower part of his sternal wound. He was resuscitated and transferred to theatre while bleeding was partially controlled by hand pressure. Femorofemoral bypass was instituted and the sternum reopened with an oscillating saw and heart dissected out. There was a 3 cm by 3 cm rupture of the right ventricular free wall about 5 cm inferior to the pulmonary valve and 5 cm to the right of the previous ventriculotomy repair. This was repaired directly using Teflon bolstered interrupted mattress sutures, on bypass, without cross clamp and with the heart beating. Bypass was discontinued easily and patient made satisfactory postop recovery. A TTE revealed dyskinetic anterior wall with moderate function elsewhere and no residual VSD and he was discharged home on 20/08/99.
Except for a grumbling sternal wound for which he underwent removal of top three sternal wires, patient remained symptomatically well and led a healthy outdoor life for the next more than a year. On 01/11/00, 14 months after his last admission, however, a CT scan showed a large left ventricular aneurysm, involving the entire anterior and apical surface of left ventricle and including the previous ventriculotomy repair. This had partially eroded through left anterior chest wall and was lying under left pectoralis minor. An MR scan on 02/11/00 revealed a large left ventricular aneurysm extending from diaphragm to the level of pulmonary bifurcation with extension of aneurysm through intercostal space into left pectoralis minor. There was an area of fluid collection under the pectoralis minor which probably was altered blood secondary to a contained rupture of the aneurysm. (Figs and ). A left ventriculogram on 23/11/00 confirmed a large left ventricular aneurysm involving more than half of the total left ventricular cavity with moderate residual function, but with no evidence of active leak from the aneurysm (Fig ). It was not clear if LV aneurysmectomy would leave sufficient LV mass to sustain life in view of the sheer proportion of LV involved in aneurysmal change. Heart transplantation was clearly not an option in light of sternal infection and multiple previous surgeries.
On 26/12/00, however, he presented with a tense pulsatile mass in the third left intercostal space extending to a sinus under mid sternum (Fig ) followed later by slow bloody discharge from the sternum (Fig ). Faced with the prospect of exsanguinating haemorrhage from the chest wall eroding aneurysm, it was elected to surgically intervene. The sternal skin was incised, the left pectoralis major was reflected upto mid axillary line and the left ventricular aneurysm eroding through the third intercostal space was exposed (Fig ). Femorofemoral bypass was instituted and secondary median sternotomy performed. Heart was dissected out with difficulty and patient cooled to 18°C. The aneurysm involved almost the entire anterior and apical surfaces of left ventricle and included the previous ventriculotomy repair. The aneurysm was completely excised, the Teflon of the previous ventriculotomy repair and the clots within the aneurysm removed and the new left ventricle reconstituted employing linear closure using long strips of Teflon on either side of ventriculotomy. Aortic cross clamp or circulatory arrest was not necessary. Patient made good recovery and was weaned off ventilation, ionotropes and IABP over the next 3 days. Excised ventricular aneurysmal tissue grew coagulase negative staph and staph epidermidis for which he received for the next 4 weeks followed by oral flucloxacillin for next 2 weeks. On 02/01/01, a repeat MR scan showed significantly improved LV, no residual aneurysm and no residual VSD. He was discharged home on 02/01/01.
He remained well till 25/02/01 when he presented with 2 day history of shortness of breath, cough and haemoptysis. Examination revealed an inflamed and tender swelling in the lower sternal area. MR scan on 26/02/01 demonstrated a large anterior mediastinal collection (Fig ). It was not clear from the films if there was any communication between either ventricle and anterior mediastinal clot or indeed the tracheobronchial tree. Meanwhile on 01/03/01, the subcutaneous swelling progressively increased in size and was close to bursting. It was felt this was once again an impending rupture of heart and therefore, the regional transplantation team was contacted who felt heart transplantation would be inappropriate. The patient was keen to have something done and he was transferred to theatre on 01/03/01.
The subcutaneous swelling over the lower sternum was aspirated and this was frank blood. Femorofemoral bypass was established through left groin and patient cooled to 28°C. Left anterolateral thoracotomy was made through 4th space to avoid going through the sternum the 5th time. The whole of the anterior mediastinum and the upper third of right hemithorax were filled with clot. After the fresh clot was evacuated from the mediastinum, we were pleasantly surprised to find that heart was pristine clear with healthy previous suture line and nothing to suggest rupture. Instead after sucking out clots from right hemithorax, it was clear there was ongoing fresh bleeding from the apex of right lung. Visualisation of this was not possible from left thoracotomy and therefore sternum was reopened the 5th time. There was a large vascular adhesion at the apex of the right lung that had torn and both the pleural and parenchymal ends were bleeding actively. There was an associated tear in the upper lobe of lung with a substantial air leak. The vascular adhesions were secured, bleeding controlled and lung tear controlled with difficulty with sutures and glue. Bypass was discontinued easily but the sternum looked quite unhealthy with substantial loss of bone and multiple fractures and I closed it with heavy ethibond in preparation for what I felt would be an inevitable plastic repair in future.
Patient made a good haemodynamic recovery but expectedly the sternum did not heal and there was a persistent air leak from the right pleural drain. On 16/03/01, he was returned to theatre. Radical debridement of most of necrotic sternum and 3rd to 7th costal cartilages was done. The patient was turned on the side and a large 10 cm × 27 cm musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap was raised including a patch of lumbar fascia. Flap was passed under skin into sternal region. The flap was inserted into the resultant sternal space, lumber fascia used to close off the abdominal cavity and a muscle tongue directed into the apex of right pleural cavity to seal off the still persistent air leak. Patient was re-explored for bleeding underneath the patch on the same evening and haemostasis secured from an arterial spurter from the bleeding bone. Postop course was complicated by persistent air leak which eventually stopped on 18/04/01. Thereafter he made good recovery and was discharged home on 19/04/01 on long term antibiotics. His postoperative MR scan showed no residual VSD, no LV or RV aneurysm and a healthy latissimus myoplasty (Fig )
Patient remains well and has required no hospitalisations or operations since. His antibiotics were stopped on 04/03/02. He is seen in outpatient clinic at 6 monthly intervals and leads a purposeful life and remains asymptomatic with a well healed sternal scar (Fig ).","[[58.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['chest', 'left sternal

Within 2 hours of assessment, the cellulitis was noted to have spread outside the boundaries marked on admission. He was hypotensive, tachycardic, febrile and noted to have an elevated white cell count.
On examination of the area there was diffuse oedema of the skin with marked erythema and heat in the area of skin from the right loin to groin across to midline. Subcutaneous crepitus was present. A lateral abdominal X-Ray revealed free gas within the subcutaneous tissues (Fig. ).
A presumed diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis was made and the patient commenced on intravenous antibiotics, resuscitated with intravenous fluids, and taken immediately to the operating theatre.
Extensive debridement of the affected cutaneous, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle was performed and pus noted to extend to the right loin area. Histology and bacteriology confirmed a diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis, with a β-haemolytic group streptococcus cultured. Exploration revealed a retroperitoneal abscess arising as a result of a perforation of a caecal carcinoma. The caecum was resected and a right hemicolectomy performed, with a large defect resulting in the anterior abdominal wall from the extensive debridement (Fig. ).
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for inotropic support and management of sepsis, and 2 days later proceeded to have a rectus femoris myocutaneous flap fashioned to close the defect in the abdominal wall. He made a good post-operative recovery, with adequate skin closure on the abdominal wall (Fig. ), and was discharged from hospital 8 weeks post-operatively.

CT-Scan of the abdomen showed a solitary 5 × 5 cm mass in segment VII of the liver. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed features consistent with HCC. AFP level at the time was normal 2.23 ng/ml (normal < 5.6 ng/ml). She traveled abroad (outside Kuwait), underwent resection of the tumor and returned back to Kuwait. A brief report stated that the tumor was resected from segment VII with about 1.5 cm safety margin with an uneventful postoperative course. Histopathology of the original tumor proved to be a well differentiated HCC with clear margins and no vascular invasion.
Upon return to Kuwait, she was under the care of the hepatologist who treating her chronic hepatitis with Pegelated Interferon and Ribaverin for 6 months. Unfortunately she remained HCV positive.
In Oct. 2004, three years following her original surgery, she was referred to the Liver Unit, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Hospital with an abdominal wall mass of one-year duration. On physical examination an obvious 7 × 5 cm smooth oval mass was seen in the right upper quadrant at the lateral border of her previous right subcostal scar. Clinically the mass seemed to be within the abdominal wall and the skin over it was free. CT scan of the abdomen showed a round well defined enhancing soft tissue density mass measuring 11 × 5 × 5 cm within the anterior abdominal wall with no intra-abdominal extension or skin infiltration (Figure ). The liver was free except from signs of previous surgery in segment VII. Tumor markers were: AFP 6.23 ng/ml (normal < 5.6 ng/ml), CEA 1.5 ng/ml (normal < 6.9 ng/ml) and CA19-9 15.9 (normal < 43 ng/dl). FNAC from this mass, was consistent with metastatic HCC (Figure ). En-bloc resection of the mass (including the mass, overlying skin, abdominal wall muscles and peritoneum) was performed under general anesthesia with primary closure. Histopathology of the removed specimen confirmed implantation of HCC in the abdominal muscles with free surgical margin and no peritoneal penetration (Figure ). The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on the 7th postoperative day.

560,1617111-1,17034632,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1617111.xml,Acute ischemic heart disease and interventional cardiology: a time for pause,"A 75-year-old woman presented at a regional hospital with a 2-hour history of increasing chest discomfort. The electrocardiogram (ECG)showed 3-mm ST-segment elevation in inferior leads. The patient was given aspirin and heparin and transferred 30 miles by ambulance to a tertiary center for primary angioplasty. Coronary angiography was begun 2.5 hours later and showed single-vessel disease, a 70% right coronary artery ostial stenosis with TIMI-3 flow. Angioplasty was performed with insertion of three stents with an intravenous infusion of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blocker, abciximab. The patient was re-transferred the next day and recovered uneventfully.
This case raises the issues of unseemly treatment delays on outcomes and the rationale for intervention when apparent reperfusion (TIMI-3 flow) has occurred.
The widely accepted notion that primary angioplasty (PA) is superior to thrombolysis is based on the recent meta-analysis of 23 randomized trials by Keeley et al showing a 2% mortality advantage for angioplasty (7% versus 9%, p = 0.0002) []. However, the overall conclusion of this meta-analysis may be questioned as older trials, using less efficient thrombolytic strategies, and one large trial (SHOCK) not comparing thrombolysis to PA were included. Thus, when the 11 trials using rapidly administered, but not bolus, fibrin-specific agents are considered separately, a significant advantage for angioplasty is either modestly present (p = 0.018) [] or no longer so (1.1 lives saved/100 patients treated, 95% CI [minus]0.3/100 to 2.6/100) [], depending on the analytical methods. When statistical significance hinges on model assumptions, it suggests that evidence of superiority for any reperfusion approach is fragile.
Time is a critical determinant of survival with any reperfusion strategy [,]. Each hour of delay to thrombolysis is associated with a loss of at least 1.6 lives/100 treated, and possibly many more if the 'golden' first hour after symptom onset is missed [,]. Concordant with these observations, prehospital thrombolysis with a 58-minute reduction in treatment time has been shown to confer a 1.7% absolute reduction in mortality compared with in-hospital thrombolysis []. A meta regression analysis from the 23 thrombolysis/PA trials has shown loss of the survival benefit for angioplasty when 'door-to-balloon' time exceeds 'door-to-needle' time for thrombolysis by 60 minutes []. Very recent large registry data confirm significant step-ups in mortality for each 30-minute increase in door-to-balloon time beyond 90 minutes []. Thus, a coherent body of knowledge underpins the importance of time until treatment and its corollary that in certain situations thrombolysis may be just as effective, than PA, or even more so. This corollary has been further underscored by a recent trial demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with prehospital thrombolysis and judicious recourse to so-called rescue angioplasty compared with PA [,].
Questions remain as to the practicality or applicability of published results favorable to PA. The mean delay to balloon inflation in the clinical trials was only 40 minutes but in the real world, delays are far longer and it is not established that similar clinical results may be attained [-]. Also, the mortality in the thrombolytic arms of these studies was higher (8–14%) than that noted in contemporary registry and trial data of thrombolytic therapy (5–6%) [,,]. Outcomes with PA depend on volume of activity [,] and whether the procedure is performed during or off normal working hours [], limitations that have not been shown to apply to thrombolysis []. While recently updated STEMI guidelines [] acknowledge that no single reperfusion strategy is appropriate for all patients and emphasize that the timely use of some reperfusion therapy is likely more important than the choice of therapy, these judicious considerations are not reflected in the current climate of enthusiasm with interventional cardiology.
The other two outcomes regarding which PA is claimed to be superior are strokes and myocardial reinfarctions. While there are about three more incapacitating hemorrhagic strokes per 1000 in patients treated with thrombolysis than in those treated with PA, there are about 20 excess major bleeds with angioplasty [,]. Bleeding can be more than an inconvenience; it has very recently been found to be independently associated with greater mortality in patients with ACS, both at 30 days and at 6 months. [] Quantification of reinfarction benefit is confounded by ascertainment bias, differing cardiac enzyme criteria depending on whether reinfarction is spontaneous or PCI-related, unbalanced use of a second antiplatelet agent (generally clopidogrel) that reduces reinfarction [,], and the problematic consideration of ST-segment re-elevation in the immediate hours following the initiation of thrombolytic therapy. Although these latter events tend to be counted as reinfarctions, the complications that are mostly unique to primary PCI (no reflow, dissection, distal embolization, and side-branch occlusion) [] and that might be considered iatrogenic reinfarctions are not systematically recorded in the trials. These limitations underline the uncertainty regarding the pertinence of the reinfarction end point in these comparative trials.
Thus, while a small benefit of PA over optimal fibrin-specific thrombolysis is suggested, uncertainty still clouds this issue and both options remain acceptable. The addition of clopidogrel to thrombolysis is likely to improve the performance of the latter relative to PA [,]. A recent regression analysis based on the randomized clinical trials suggests no benefit of PA over thrombolysis when the mortality risk of STEMI is < 4.5% and possible harm with treatment delay []. Therefore, discriminating clinicians might reserve the recourse to PA for patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) at particular risk (patients with heart failure or hemodynamic instability or high bleeding risk from thrombolysis) [,,]. The importance of avoiding excessive delays with hospital transfers and off-hours angioplasty that may compromise patient outcomes compared with prompt on-site thrombolysis cannot be overemphasized.

561,1617111-2,17034632,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1617111.xml,Acute ischemic heart disease and interventional cardiology: a time for pause,"Twenty-four hours after thrombolysis of a Q-wave inferior MI, a 71-year old man had 5 minutes of mild chest discomfort followed by spontaneous resolution. There were no associated hemodynamic or dynamic electrocardiographic abnormalities noted. An angiogram was ordered and performed the next day. The patient had single-vessel disease with an occluded right coronary artery that was successfully reopened with 2 stents inserted under an infusion of eptifibatide, a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blocker. There was normal TIMI-3 flow. The contrast ventriculogram showed inferior akinesia with an ejection fraction over 50%. The patient did well subsequently. An echocardiogram a year later showed unchanged inferior akinesia.
This case raises the issues of whether invasive intervention is indicated for recurrent mild, self-limited symptoms following MI and whether delayed opening of an occluded coronary artery after MI is beneficial, relative to the expenses and risks, given our current understanding of myocardial viability.
Even when the initial approach in STEMI is thrombolysis, the threshold for invasive intervention is becoming ever lower, more as a function of the improved safety of the procedure than proof of improved outcomes. Another common example is the patient sent for 'rescue' angioplasty after thrombolysis because of residual chest pain, despite ST-segment resolution. Persistent but diminishing chest discomfort is common following presentation with acute MI and we believe that it tends not to be distinguished from new or ongoing ischemia. Nor is it appreciated how symptoms may be amplified by the attitude and behavior of the treating team. The 'rescue' coronary angiogram will undoubtedly reveal a culprit lesion that will be stented even if flow is already satisfactory on angiographic imaging, and frequently even if the stenosis is no longer significant. The threshold for this intervention can be expected to fall further as fears of restenosis diminish with drug-eluting stents. The satisfaction with the result–often displayed to the patient in the catheterization laboratory by video rerun–will have a powerful therapeutic effect on residual symptoms. The still photographs often included in the patient chart will serve as a stimulus to clinicians for further rapid referrals.
Another not uncommon example of 'rescue' angioplasty is the asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patient referred for PCI because of persistent ST-elevation of variable degree, although the time window for any reasonable expectation of myocardial salvage is well past. Poor microvascular perfusion may well persist despite successful stenting, platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockade, and even TIMI-3 flow [], suggesting that 'no-reflow' was the problem in the first place and was unchanged by the intervention. Inadequate myocardial perfusion despite reestablished epicardial artery flow, a phenomenon that is ischemic-time-dependent (26), in addition to a low potential for myocardial salvage after a few hours of persistent ischemia, may account for absence of consistent and marked benefit of 'rescue' angioplasty in recent studies [-].
In our experience, another group frequently referred for cardiac catheterization and PCI is post-MI patients who perform a very adequate exercise test, indicative of low risk, without ischemic symptoms, but whose ECG shows ST-depression, compatible with residual myocardial ischemia. However, several large studies, notably in the GISSI thrombolytic cohort, have shown that the sole presence of an asymptomatic ECG-positive exercise test following MI predicts neither mortality nor reinfarction [,]. Even the more recent DANAMI-1 study [], with its inherent biases in favor of aggressive intervention (suboptimal medical therapy and inappropriate randomization of high-risk patients), showed only relatively small benefit from intervention in this context [].
The final example of overuse of invasive intervention in STEMI is the routine recourse to angiography following thrombolysis, resulting in anatomy-driven revascularization of significant and, increasingly, of borderline and noncritical lesions []. The belief that coronary angiography is the most secure and definitive means of risk stratification and that most of these patients will need angiography in any case, is being espoused by growing numbers of clinicians, contributing to the surge of PCI following an ACS. This strong faith in and increasing clinical dependence on 'defining the coronary anatomy' is paradoxical, given evidence that 1) coronary anatomy is an unreliable indicator and predictor of symptoms, the functional significance of lesions, and the risk of new or recurrent acute coronary instability; 2) left ventricular function is much more prognostically important than coronary anatomy; and 3) the prognostic capability of noninvasive physiological stratification using the ECG exercise test or stress nuclear perfusion imaging or echocardiography is well established.
Older studies showing that there was no advantage to systematic invasive cardiac management after MI are considered no longer relevant in the modern era []. The recent GRACIA study randomized 500 patients with acute STEMI and concluded that a systematic invasive approach is better than an ischemia-guided approach []. The primary combined end point of death, reinfarction, and revascularization at 12 months occurred in 21% of the group whose treatment was ischemia-guided, versus 9% of the group whose treatment was invasive (relative risk 0.44, 95% CI 0.28–0.70) and was essentially driven by the revascularization rate. However, in a classic example of self-fulfilling methodology, the revascularization procedures that were done during the initial hospital stay did not count in the primary end point. Had these procedures been included in the analysis, the inference drawn from the study would have been completely different, since more than twice as many combined events of death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization would then be tallied in the group whose treatment was invasive as in the group whose treatment was ischemia-guided [].
An additional argument marshaled in support of this approach is the open-artery hypothesis: the notion that beyond any consideration of myocardial salvage or symptomatic ischemia, there are long-term advantages to reopening an occluded or severely narrowed infarct-related coronary artery []. While this belief has been expressed for over a decade, there are as yet no prospective randomized trial data in its support. In fact, the only such study found paradoxically worse left ventricular remodeling in patients who underwent revascularization []. The ongoing NIH-sponsored Open Artery Trial will help clarify this question [].
Thus, the previous restrained attitude that based invasive cardiac referral after MI on well-defined high-risk clinical criteria is being abandoned. Despite the paucity of data to support it and with little apparent concern for its economic and logistic implications, there are increasing calls to recognize systematic invasive cardiac management as the ideal option [], one which has now become enshrined in the latest European Society of Cardiology guidelines on PCI as a class-1, level-of-evidence-A recommendation, with the dictum that if primary PCI cannot be performed, one should 'lyse now, stent later' [].","[[71.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['chest', 'single-vessel', 'right coronary artery', 'coronary artery', 'myocardial', 'chest', 'chest', 'coronary', 'myocardial', 'microvascular', 'myocardial', 'epicardial artery', 'cardiac', 'myocardial', 'coronary anatomy', 'coronary', 'coronary anatomy', 'coronary', 'left ventricular', 'coronary anatomy', 'cardiac', 'myocardial', 'artery', 'myocardial', 'coronary artery', 'left ventricular', 'Artery', 'cardiac', 'cardiac']","['Q-wave inferior MI', 'chest discomfort', 'hemodynamic or dynamic electrocardiographic abnormalities', 'single-vessel disease', 'occluded right coronary artery', 'normal TIMI-3 flow', 'inferior akinesia', 'did well', 'inferior akinesia', 'symptoms', 'MI', 'occluded coronary artery', 'MI', 'myocardial viability', 'STEMI', 'chest pain', 'ST-segment resolution', 'chest discomfort', 'MI', 'ischemia', 'symptoms', 'culprit lesion', 'flow is already satisfactory', 'stenosis', 'restenosis diminish', 'symptoms', 'symptomatic', 'ST-elevation', 'microvascular perfusion', 'platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockade', 'reflow', 'myocardial perfusion', 'epicardial artery flow', 'phenomenon', 'ischemia', 'indicative of low risk', 'ischemic symptoms', 'ST-depression', 'myocardial ischemia', 'GISSI thrombolytic cohort', 'asymptomatic', 'MI', 'mortality', 'reinfarction', 'STEMI', 'lesions', 'ACS', 'unreliable indicator', 'predictor of symptoms', 'lesions', 'coronary instability', 'left ventricular function is much more prognostically important than coronary anatomy', 'MI', 'STEMI', 'death', 'reinfarction', 'ischemia-guided', 'invasive', 'revascularization rate', 'death', 'myocardial infarction', 'ischemia-guided', 'ischemia', 'left ventricular remodeling', 'MI']",['eptifibatide'],['71-year'],"['thrombolysis of a Q-wave inferior MI', 'angiogram', 'reopened with 2 stents inserted under an infusion of eptifibatide', 'platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blocker', 'contrast ventriculogram', 'ejection fraction', 'echocardiogram', 'invasive intervention', 'delayed opening of an occluded coronary artery', 'thrombolysis', 'invasive intervention', ""rescue' angioplasty"", 'thrombolysis', 'coronary angiogram', 'stented', 'angiographic imaging', 'drug-eluting stents', ""rescue' angioplasty"", 'PCI', 'myocardial salvage', 'stenting', 'TIMI', 'intervention', 'myocardial salvage', 'angioplasty', 'cardiac catheterization', 'PCI', 'exercise test', 'ECG', 'ECG-positive', 'DANAMI-1 study', 'invasive intervention', 'angiography', 'thrombolysis', 'revascularization', 'coronary angiography', 'angiography', 'PCI', 'ECG exercise test', 'stress nuclear perfusion imaging', 'echocardiography', 'systematic invasive cardiac management', 'invasive cardiac management', 'GRACIA study', 'revascularization', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'revascularization', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'myocardial salvage', 'reopening', 'reopening an occluded or severely narrowed infarct-related coronary artery', 'revascularization', 'invasive cardiac', 'invasive cardiac management', 'PCI', 'primary PCI', 'lyse', 'stent']","['Twenty-four hours', '5 minutes', 'a year later']"

The ECG showed 1–2-mm inferior T-wave inversion. Treatment was initiated with nitrates, aspirin, and heparin. A few hours later, cardiac troponin became positive and a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor was started as well as clopidogrel. Cardiac catheterization was requested at the nearest tertiary center, 100 miles away. The next day, with no recurrent symptoms, the patient was transferred. Angiography showed an occluded third marginal circumflex artery, stenosis of the distal left anterior descending artery estimated at 80%, and stenosis of the distal right coronary artery estimated at 70%. Angioplasty was performed, with insertion of two stents in the reopened marginal artery, three stents in the left anterior descending artery, and one stent in the distal right coronary artery. The subsequent radiological report evaluated the pre-PCI distal left anterior descending artery stenosis to be 40–50% and the pre-PCI distal right stenosis to be 50%.
This case raises the questions of whether we are overtreating patients and overestimating their coronary lesion severity.
In parallel with the preeminence achieved by interventional cardiology in the management of STEMI, the pendulum has now swung in favor of the invasive strategy for patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI, much impelled by the recent FRISC-2 and TACTICS trials [,]. Earlier studies [,] suggesting that there is no advantage or even that there is a worse outcome with a systematically invasive strategy are now deemed irrelevant. The previous management strategy of reserving coronary angiography and revascularization for patients who were refractory to adequate medical therapy or were hemodynamically unstable or manifested evidence of low-threshold ischemia or signs of severe coronary artery disease on noninvasive testing is now considered too restrictive. What is the strength of evidence for this change?
The FRISC-2 study [,] randomized 2457 patients to either an invasive strategy with routine coronary angiography (and revascularization depending on the coronary artery anatomy) or initial noninvasive management. At one year, results favored the invasively treated group both in terms of death (2.2% versus 3.9%, p = 0.016) and death or recurrent MI (10.4% versus 14.1%, p = 0.005). A criticism of this study has been that its design disadvantaged the initially noninvasive (or 'conservative') arm because the clinical threshold for crossing over to the systematically invasive arm was too high. Patients had to have incapacitating symptoms or do very poorly on an exercise test (at least 3 mm ST-segment depression or limiting angina at low workload) to qualify for crossover. This is a higher threshold than most clinicians would normally tolerate and may have exposed these patients to avoidable risk. Indeed, this crossover threshold has been shown to miss about 50% of patients with severe coronary artery disease found by more conventional standards []. This finding underscores the limitations of the term 'conservative strategy', if the strategy is not anchored to clinically appropriate criteria for recourse to invasive cardiac procedures. Overly stringent criteria for crossover ensure a finding of superiority for a systematic invasive strategy, while overly unselective criteria lead to futile comparisons between strategies that end up resembling each other.
The TACTICS trial [] also concluded that an early invasive strategy is superior, although the results found in this trial are quite modest relative to the impact it has had on the generalization of invasive cardiac management (Figure ). The invasive strategy did not significantly reduce mortality, and the reduction in the combined end point of death or MI was of only borderline statistical significance at 6 months (7.3% in the invasive arm versus 9.5% in the conservative arm, p = 0.049). Limitations, including the previously described detection bias for MI [] and unbalancing of adjunctive therapies following randomization (less platelet IIb/IIIa blockade during cross-over PCI in the conservative arm than in the invasive arm and more oral antiplatelet therapy in the invasive arm) cloud any interpretation of superiority. In support of these criticisms, the more recent RITA 3 trial [] found no significant difference in the occurrence of death or MI with an invasive versus a conservative approach in patients with ACS at one year (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.67–1.25). Only the softer end point of 'refractory angina' was reduced with an invasive strategy.
Notwithstanding the fragility of the above evidence in its favor, the recently updated ACC/AHA Guidelines now call strongly (Class I, Level of Evidence A) for an early invasive strategy in patients with unstable angina/NSTEMI who have any 'high-risk indicators' []. The need for early cardiac catheterization with likely revascularization is undisputed for refractory ischemia, arrhythmic or hemodynamic instability, ischemic heart failure, or evidence of severe disease on noninvasive testing. However, other postulated high-risk features such as PCI within 6 months or prior bypass surgery are intuitively questionable and suffer from a lack of evidence, because these patients have often been excluded from the major clinical trials. And while new ST-segment depression and/or raised cardiac troponin do indicate patients at higher risk, why is an initially conservative approach necessarily eschewed? Most such patients in fact do well, as suggested by the low positive predictive value (10–15%) of raised troponin for the end point of death or MI []. Consequently, the quasi-automatic recourse to invasive interventions and expensive drugs for all patients with ACS and raised troponin may be questioned. It is surprising that a major decision of clinical management now increasingly tends to be driven by the single reading of one blood test, without considering the patient's entire–and dynamic–clinical picture.
A very recent meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials (9212 patients) comparing routine and selective catheterization strategies in non-ST elevation ACS actually showed significantly increased mortality during hospitalization in the routine invasive arm and no significant overall mortality difference (odds ratio (OR) routine versus selective 0.92; 95% CI 0.77–1.09, p = 0.33) []. There was an absolute 2.1% fewer nonfatal MIs (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.65–0.88, p < 0.001), and an absolute 2.8% less severe angina (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.68–0.87, p < 0.001) with the routinely invasive strategy []. Statistical significance notwithstanding, these small clinical differences are further attenuated by the methodological limitations of TACTICS and FRISC-2 previously discussed. Therefore, we believe the evidence in favor of a systematic invasive strategy is not compelling.
This position is reinforced by two very recently published studies. The first is the long-term (3–5 years) follow-up of the RITA 3 trial []. It shows a rate of death or MI of 16.6% with systematically invasive treatment and 20.0% with conservative treatment (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61–0.99, p = 0.044). Although this would seem to support a blanket invasive approach, the small degree of benefit, an annualized rate difference of less than 1%, with a wide, barely statistically significant confidence interval, suggests that this evidence is not conclusive. Moreover, when the patients were stratified by baseline risk, only those in the eighth highest risk group appeared to benefit. This study can therefore be interpreted as an incentive precisely to treat all patients with ACS invasively but rather to identify the minority that would truly benefit from invasive management. The second study, the ICTUS trial [] of 1200 troponin-positive NSTEMI patients receiving the most contemporary medical and invasive management strategies, found no significant difference at one year in the combined end point of death, nonfatal MI, and rehospitalization for anginal symptoms between a systematic early invasive and a conservative strategy (1.07, 95% CI 0.87–1.33, p = 0.33). The mortality rate was the same and MI (applying the same definition to both groups) was actually more frequent in the group given systematically invasive treatment (15% versus 10%, p = 0.005). These findings were essentially unchanged when the definitions for the MI end point of the previous studies were applied.","[[49.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['chest', 'cardiac', 'Cardiac', 'third marginal circumflex artery', 'distal left anterior descending artery', 'distal right coronary artery', 'marginal artery', 'left anterior descending artery', 'distal right coronary artery', 'distal left anterior descending artery', 'coronary', 'coronary', 'coronary artery', 'coronary', 'coronary artery', 'arm', 'arm', 'coronary artery', 'cardiac', 'cardiac', 'invasive arm', 'arm', 'conservative arm', 'platelet IIb/IIIa', 'conservative arm', 'invasive arm', 'invasive arm', 'cardiac', 'heart', 'cardiac']","['chest pain', 'inferior T-wave inversion', 'symptoms', 'occluded third marginal circumflex artery', 'stenosis of the distal left anterior descending artery', 'stenosis of the distal right coronary artery', 'one stent in the distal right coronary artery', 'distal left anterior descending artery stenosis', 'coronary lesion', 'STEMI', 'angina', 'NSTEMI', 'worse outcome', 'refractory to adequate medical therapy', 'hemodynamically unstable', 'ischemia', 'coronary artery disease', 'death', 'death', 'MI', 'incapacitating symptoms', 'symptoms', 'do very poorly', 'ST-segment depression', 'limiting angina', 'crossover', 'coronary artery disease', 'reduce mortality', 'death', 'MI', 'MI', 'platelet IIb/IIIa blockade', 'death', 'MI', 'ACS', 'angina', 'angina', 'NSTEMI', 'refractory ischemia', 'arrhythmic', 'hemodynamic instability', 'ischemic heart failure', 'disease', 'ST-segment depression', 'death', 'MI', 'ACS', 'raised troponin', 'non-ST elevation ACS', 'mortality', 'overall mortality difference', 'nonfatal MIs', 'angina', 'ACS', 'NSTEMI', 'death', 'nonfatal MI', 'anginal symptoms', 'MI', 'findings were essentially unchanged', 'MI']","['nitrates', 'aspirin', 'heparin', 'clopidogrel']","['49', 'regional hospital', 'interventional cardiology']","['ECG', 'Treatment', 'cardiac troponin', 'glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor', 'Cardiac catheterization', 'Angiography', 'Angioplasty', 'insertion of two stents in the reopened marginal artery', 'three stents in the left anterior descending artery', 'one stent in the distal right coronary artery', 'radiological', 'invasive strategy', 'FRISC-2', 'TACTICS trials', 'coronary angiography', 'revascularization', 'medical therapy', 'noninvasive testing', 'FRISC-2 study', 'coronary angiography', 'revascularization', 'noninvasive management', 'exercise test', 'invasive cardiac procedures', 'invasive cardiac management', 'invasive strategy', 'p', 'adjunctive therapies', 'cross-over PCI', 'antiplatelet therapy', 'RITA 3', 'RITA 3 trial', 'RR', 'CI', 'cardiac catheterization', 'revascularization', 'noninvasive testing', 'PCI', 'bypass', 'bypass surgery', 'cardiac troponin', 'troponin', 'invasive interventions', 'drugs', 'troponin', 'blood test', 'meta-analysis', 'routine and selective catheterization strategies', 'odds ratio (OR)', 'selective', 'CI', 'p', 'OR', 'CI', 'p', 'OR', 'CI', 'p', 'TACTICS', 'FRISC-2', 'systematic invasive strategy', 'studies', 'RITA 3 trial', 'rate of death', 'MI', 'systematically invasive treatment', 'conservative treatment', 'OR', '95% CI', 'p', 'blanket invasive approach', 'invasive management', 'troponin-positive', 'medical and invasive management strategies', 'invasive', 'invasive and a conservative strategy', 'conservative strategy', 'p', 'mortality rate', 'invasive treatment', 'p', 'studies']","['several hours', 'pre-PCI', 'at one year', 'within 6 months', 'prior', 'prior', 'one year']"

On examination, she was afebrile (however, temperature of 37.8°C noticed by General Practitioner 6 hours before presentation in the Casualty) but tachycardic with pulse rate of 134/minute. There was no bruising or haematoma in the abdominal wall. The abdomen was distended with marked tenderness in the right lower quadrant. There were guarding and rebound tenderness in the right iliac fossa. The rectal examination revealed tenderness in the right pelvic wall. The urine dipstick was positive for the ketones and trace of protein. The pregnancy test was negative. The blood investigations showed haemoglobin of 10.8 gm/dl with reduced haematocrit of 32%, White Blood Cells of 11.8 × 109/l and INR of 2.2. The blood biochemistry did not reveal any abnormality.
The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. She was scoring 8 according to modified Alvarado scoring system []. The decision for appendectomy was made and the consent was given for the emergency appendectomy. Through the Lanz incision, about 200 ml of haemorrhagic fluid was aspirated from the peritoneal cavity. The appendix and the mesoappendix were looking normal. The appendectomy was performed. Intra-operatively, there were several blood clots present, so the incision was converted to the formal transverse infra-umbilical laparotomy incision. The large, 10 × 15 cm2 size blood clot was evacuated from the pelvis. Despite thorough search for the active bleeding site, we could not find any cause for active bleeding. The final diagnosis of the spontaneous intra-peritoneal bleeding secondary to warfarin was made. The abdomen was closed with the low suction drain, which drained about 200 ml of the serosanguinous fluid over next 2 days. 2 units of fresh frozen plasma were transfused in the immediate post-operative period. The warfarin was stopped after the operation. The patient was re-warfarinised on 8th post-operative day and was followed up in the surgical and the haematology clinics. At 2 weeks follow up visit in surgical clinic; patient was doing well without any complaints and complications. The histology of the appendix confirmed normal appendix without any inflammation.","[[41.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['abdominal', 'peri-umbilical region', 'right iliac fosssa', 'right shoulder', 'pulmonary', 'abdominal wall', 'abdomen', 'right lower quadrant', 'right iliac fossa', 'rectal', 'right pelvic wall', 'peritoneal cavity', 'appendix', 'mesoappendix', 'transverse infra-umbilical', 'intra-peritoneal', 'abdomen', 'appendix']","['migratory abdominal pain', 'pain', 'vomiting', 'loss of appetite', 'pain', 'trauma', 'pulmonary embolism', 'afebrile', 'tachycardic', 'bruising', 'haematoma', 'distended', 'tenderness', 'guarding', 'rebound tenderness', 'tenderness', 'abnormality', 'appendicitis', 'haemorrhagic fluid', 'blood clots', 'bleeding', 'bleeding', 'intra-peritoneal bleeding', 'serosanguinous fluid', 'complaints', 'complications', 'normal appendix', 'inflammation']","['warfarin', 'tylex', 'paracetamol', 'codeine', 'pantoprazole', 'tramadol', 'senna', 'migraleve', 'zimovane', 'fentanyl citrate', 'warfarin', 'warfarin']","['41', 'G.P.', 'haematology clinics', 'surgical clinic']","['hysterectomy', 'prophylaxis', 'medications', 'temperature', 'pulse rate', 'urine dipstick', 'ketones', 'protein', 'pregnancy test', 'blood', 'haemoglobin', 'reduced haematocrit', 'White Blood Cells', 'INR', 'blood biochemistry', 'modified Alvarado scoring system', 'appendectomy', 'emergency appendectomy', 'Through the Lanz incision, about 200 ml of haemorrhagic fluid was aspirated from the peritoneal cavity', 'Lanz incision', 'appendectomy', 'incision was converted to the formal transverse infra-umbilical laparotomy incision', 'abdomen was closed with the low suction drain', 'drained about 200 ml of the serosanguinous fluid', 'fresh frozen plasma were transfused', 'frozen plasma were transfused', 'operation', 're-warfarinised', 'histology', 'histology of the appendix']","['2-day', 'In the past', 'Intra-operatively', 'next 2 days', 'post-operative period', 'post-operative period', '8th post-operative day']"

The patient was found to have a mass in his left kidney and radiological workup had shown lesions within his liver. The patient came to our hospital seeking treatment from one of our urologists. In order to rule out a urinary bladder carcinoma, a urinary cytology was performed and showed no malignant cells. As part of his preoperative workup, the patient had CT scans of his thorax, abdomen and pelvis. The scans once again showed a large lesion on his kidney (Figure ) and also defined multiple lesions within his liver. All but one appeared to be small simple cysts. A lesion found in segment 4a of the liver showed a circumscribed 1.1 × 1.6 cm hyperattenuating lesion pre-contrast (Figure ) that did not enhance post-contrast. The report indicated suspicion for metastasis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Because of the concern for metastatic disease, the lesion was removed and frozen section was performed intraoperatively. A 1.5 × 1.5 × 0.5 cm tan-pink cyst was examined and diagnosed as an epithelium lined cyst. Surgery was then continued and left nephrectomy was performed for removal of the renal mass. The surgery was without complications and postoperative hospital course was uneventful. On permanent sections, the cyst was microscopically described as composed of ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, subepithelial connective tissue, smooth muscle layer and outer fibrous capsule (Figure and ). A diagnosis of CHFC was given. Grossly, the renal mass consisted of a well-circumscribed nodule with a solid, golden yellow cut surface. Histologically, it was composed of malignant clear cells with a rounded to polygonal shape and abundant clear cytoplasm forming a trabecular and nesting pattern with a prominent delicate vascular network. The final diagnosis was renal cell carcinoma (RCC), clear cell type. Two years after the surgery the patient is free of disease.","[[63.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['left kidney', 'liver', 'urinary bladder', 'urinary', 'thorax', 'abdomen', 'pelvis', 'kidney', 'liver', 'segment 4a of the liver', 'liver', 'epithelium lined', 'renal', 'columnar epithelium', 'subepithelial connective tissue', 'smooth muscle layer', 'outer fibrous capsule', 'renal', 'trabecular', 'renal']","['hematuria', 'mass', 'lesions', 'urinary bladder carcinoma', 'malignant cells', 'lesion', 'lesions', 'cysts', 'lesion', 'hyperattenuating lesion', 'metastasis', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'metastatic disease', 'lesion', 'cyst', 'epithelium lined cyst', 'renal mass', 'complications', 'cyst', 'ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium', 'CHFC', 'renal mass', 'mass', 'nodule', 'malignant clear cells', 'clear cytoplasm', 'nesting pattern', 'delicate vascular network', 'renal cell carcinoma', 'RCC', 'disease']",[],['63'],"['workup', 'radiological workup', 'treatment', 'urinary cytology', 'workup', 'CT scans of his thorax, abdomen and pelvis', 'scans', 'lesion was removed', 'frozen section', 'left nephrectomy', 'removal of the renal mass', 'surgery', 'surgery']","['preoperative', 'intraoperatively', 'Two years']"

He was afebrile and had a blood pressure of 128/80, left arm, seated. Otherwise healthy, he experienced gradual right wrist pain over the hamate and did not report a traumatic golf injury, although he does play golf. He had a previous fracture to the left hamulus over one year prior [Fig ] that apparently occurred on an attempt at ball strike with a sand wedge while playing golf, in which he struck a rock just behind the ball. In that case, immediate pain was noted and the condition was misdiagnosed by a sports medicine clinic prior to evaluation by the chiropractic clinician in his chiropractic office []. The left hook had to be excised due to failure of fragment fusion after plaster splinting, which was applied for six weeks for the treatment of a suspected scaphoid fracture. The patient's wrist injury healed post-surgically with some complications involving a subsequent navicular-lunate ligament tear and the patient was eventually able to return to golf.
Since there was a previous misdiagnosed fracture to the left wrist in this case, the patient called the chiropractic office first. Due to his history, computed tomography [CT] was ordered immediately following an examination which demonstrated mild to moderate pain on all right wrist movements, point tenderness over the hamate and previous difficulty in obtaining a carpal tunnel view on plain film x-ray.
The CT scan revealed a complete, slightly displaced fracture of the hook of the right hamate with associated soft tissue edema [Fig ]. A referral to an orthopedic surgeon was made to assess the need for excision of the hook of the hamate. Because of prior history, the patient elected to have the hook excised without conservative therapy.
Bilateral fracture of the hamate is uncommon. In a case-report by Bray, Swafford and Brown in 1985 [], their search of the literature found only 19 cases prior to 1977. In this case, the left wrist had an apparent mechanism of injury classic for fracture at this site, as it is the left hamate that contacts the butt of the club in a right-handed golfer []. However, the right wrist did not have this mechanism of injury. This may suggest some preexisting condition of the hamate in this patient. A condition known as hamate bipartite affects the hamate in some patients [,]. This condition, which is thought to be the result of fibrocartilagenous union between the body and hook of the hamate, typically causes symptoms in this part of the wrist and is characterized by a weak or ununited appearance of the hook that can be detected on CT or plain film radiographs [].
Hamate bipartite tends to be suspected in cases where there is no history of trauma or surgery to the wrist []. In our case, there was a denial of traumatic golf injury to the right wrist but was apparent in the left.
Features of hamate bipartite according to Pierre-Jerome & Roug [] include;
• Bilaterally similar bipartite hamulus
• No sign or history of traumatic wrist injury or edema or soft tissue changes suggestive of un-united fracture
• Equal size and uniform signal intensity on MRI evaluation of each part
• Absence of progressive degenerative changes between the two components of the hamate or elsewhere in the wrist
• Smooth, well corticated and rounded margins of the hamate and un-united hook.
Symptoms were noted in the case of the left fracture immediately upon the patient's dubbed ball strike and only surgical excision relieved the pain []. Additionally, the original radiological report accompanying the images of the right wrist was indicative of fracture and not otherwise. The attending radiologist noted degenerative changes within the right wrist, separation of the naviculolunate interspace and 1–2 mm of separation of the hook from the body of the hamate. There was also some indication of a possible previous fracture of the capitate noted by the radiologist, which would further indicate possible previous trauma to the right wrist. However, the patient denied previous trauma.
Hamate fractures represent approximately 2–4% of all fractures involving the carpal bones []. Fractures involving the hamulus, or hook, represent one of the two groups of fractures of the hamate []. Norman and others documented three radiographic signs suggestive of fracture of the hamulus []. According to their criteria, the most frequently encountered and most important feature is the lack of visualization of the hook. On the dorsovolar view the hamulus is seen en face super-imposed over the hamate and demonstrates a cortical ring shadow known as the ""eye sign"" []. A blurry or indistinguishable appearance of the ""eye"", as well as sclerosis of the hamulus, seen associated with nonunion, represents the other two radiographic features that suggest fracture of the hook [,].
Various radiographic positioning techniques can prove useful in the evaluation of potential hamate fractures. These may not always be of diagnostic quality due to limited range of motion experienced by the patient as a result of pain, especially in acute or subacute fractures []. Moreover, these fractures are commonly overlooked on standard radiographic studies of the wrist due to the lack of specific physical exam findings and a low index of suspicion []. Conventional radiographic examination of the wrist usually consists of the dorsovolar view, which demonstrates the radiographic signs first described by Norman and colleagues as discussed previously, as well as the lateral and medial oblique projections [].
The use of the carpal tunnel view [Fig ] has increased in an attempt to better elucidate the presence of a hamulus fracture []. Originally described by Gaynor and Hart [,], it is set with the patient positioned such that the flexor surface of their forearm lies against the film with slight radial rotation and the long axis of their hand is made as vertical as possible. The central ray is directed toward the palmar surface distal to the base of the third metacarpal with 25–30° of tube angulation. The patient may use their other hand or some other appropriate device to hold their wrist in this extended position [].
The ""radial-deviated, thumb-abducted lateral view"" [Fig ] is considered by some authors, an underused technique that adequately demonstrates the hamate between the thumb and index finger and clearly displays fractures of the hamulus []. This radiograph is performed by positioning the patient with their forearm in neutral and the medial aspect of their wrist against the film cassette. Their thumb is fully extended and abducted and their wrist deviated radially. This position results in maximum widening of the index finger-thumb web space []. The central ray is directed at the center portion of the index finger and thumb web. Alternately, the radial deviation can be excluded and a 15° tube angulation, oriented toward the wrist, can be used []. Bhalla and colleagues consider this view a cost-effective and time-saving adjunct to traditional wrist series when fracture of the hook of the hamate is suspected.
The hamulus, which develops from its own ossification center, may fail to fuse with the body of the hamate []. This normal variant is referred to as the os hamuli proprium and may be difficult to differentiate from avulsion fractures of the hamate hook []. In equivocal cases, computed tomography [CT] of the wrist is an effective advanced imaging technique to confirm the diagnosis of hamulus fractures due to its ability to provide an image that is orthogonal to the plane of the hamulus base fracture, while avoiding the possibility of superimposed anatomical structures [,]. In fact, it has been suggested that it is pointless to obtain plain films when hamulus fracture is suspected clinically and that CT should be the initial imaging modality chosen [].
Moreover, with the newer generation spiral CT multiple imaging planes can be obtained after a single scan []. With complete fractures, CT clearly reveals an osseous fragment demonstrating indistinct and irregular apposing cortical margins separated from the parent bone []. Incomplete fractures exhibit partial cortical disruption without osseous fragment separation. Additionally, internal joint derangements, such as injuries to the triangular fibrocartilage complex, may be found in association with fracture of the hamulus depending on the mechanism of injury such as a fall on the outstretched, pronated arm. Physical examination of these patients reveals tenderness between the pisiform and ulnar styloid on the ulnar border of the wrist []. Typically, however, there would be no indication of fracture in these patients and imaging would make the differential diagnosis []. Further, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] is, in the opinion of the authors, most effective in determining the presence and extent of these injuries.","[[19.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['left arm', 'right

571,1622750-1,16984659,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1622750.xml,Collision tumor of the thyroid: follicular variant of papillary carcinoma and squamous carcinoma,"A 65 year old woman presented with a long standing goiter of 10 years duration and recent swellings over the back and the scalp since 3 months. The thyroid swelling was slow growing with no history of a rapid increase in the recent past. The patient's thyroid function tests (T3, T4 and TSH) were within normal limits and she had no pressure signs and symptoms. Her past history was non-contributory. A complete physical examination revealed a large, firm multinodular swelling involving the entire thyroid gland. There was no palpable cervical adenopathy and a review of all other systems was negative. Endoscopic and radiological (barium swallow) examination of the upper aerodigestive tract were normal. Her vocal cords were mobile. Examination also revealed fluctuant swellings of the left parietal and left thoracic paraspinal regions. An ultrasound of the neck revealed a 7.4 cm large heterogeneous tumor of the thyroid with bilateral lymphadenopathy of intermediate origin at levels II and III. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid gland and the scalp lesion confirmed a follicular variant of papillary carcinoma with metastatic deposits in the scalp. A biopsy of the scalp lesion was not performed in view of fine needle aspiration cytology diagnosis. A biopsy of the paraspinal mass too showed a follicular variant of papillary carcinoma. An elevated serum thyroglobulin level (> 800 ng/ml) supported the thyroid origin of the primary tumor. The chest x-ray was normal. The patient was staged as cT3 N0 M1 (Stage IVc, AJCC – TNM) []. The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy with central compartment clearance and bilateral selective neck dissections (levels II, III & IV). At surgery, the tumor was confirmed to arise from the gland. There were no separate lesions to suggest the presence of a thyroglossal cyst remnant or infiltration of the thyroid gland by a primary from an adjacent organ. Histopathology revealed a collision tumor with components of both a follicular variant of a papillary carcinoma and a squamous carcinoma. In view of the large tumor and dual histology, we planned for radio iodine therapy directed toward the follicular derived component of the thyroid tumor and external beam radiotherapy for the squamous component. The patient was referred for adjuvant treatment but unfortunately did not come for follow-up. At the last follow-up on the 4th August 2005 the patient was free of primary tumor; three months after completion of surgical therapy. Attempts to contact the patient via all possible resources were futile.
The total thyroidectomy specimen measured 8.5 cm × 5.5 cm × 3.0 cms, with a solid, encapsulated tumor involving the right lobe and the isthmus. On cut surface, a tan colored fleshy tumor measuring 6.0 × 5.0 × 2.5 cms was seen with a thin rim of thyroid parenchyma partially surrounding it. Juxtaposed to this tumor was another distinct gray-white tumor measuring 3.0 × 2.5 × 2.0 cms showing a central irregular cystic area. The left lobe was unremarkable. The largest node dissected was 0.8 cm in diameter and was grossly unremarkable.
Multiple sections from the thyroid mass displayed an invasive follicular variant of papillary carcinoma with foci of capsular invasion. There was an obvious extrathyroidal extension of the tumor. Juxtaposed with the papillary carcinoma in close proximity was an independent primary tumour with histology of a moderately differentiated non keratinizing squamous carcinoma. The two tumours were separated by fibrous septae over a broad area. They intermingled minimally at the interface representing a true ""collision tumor"" (Figure , ). The follicular variant of papillary carcinoma showed a uniform follicular differentiation without papillary areas or squamous morules. Classical nuclear features of papillary carcinoma namely nuclear crowding, nuclear clearing, overlapping and grooving with irregularities of the nuclear membrane were evident (Figure ). These two tumors were distinct morphologically and were also independent without a zone of transition from papillary to squamous carcinoma. As the squamous carcinoma was non-keratinizing in nature, keratin pearls were not seen but clusters of cohesive cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and distinct cytoplasmic borders were noted (Figure , ). The squamous carcinoma revealed a large area of cystic degeneration in the center and also showed muscle infiltration at the periphery. A diligent search failed to reveal remnants of thyroglossal cyst or areas of anaplastic carcinoma. There was an absence of lymphoid tissue around the component of squamous carcinoma. The uninvolved lobe showed no evidence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
One of the fourteen dissected nodes showed a focus of metastatic papillary carcinoma (micrometastasis) without extranodal invasion. The disease was staged histopathologically as pT3 N1 M1 (Stage IVc, AJCC – TNM) [].
The components of papillary carcinoma were strongly positive for thyroglobulin and TTF1 (Thyroid transcription factor) while they were negative for calcitonin. The squamous carcinoma cells were positive for cytokeratin only but negative for thyroglobulin, TTF1 and calcitonin, confirming the independent origins of the tumors.","[[65.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['back', 'scalp', 'thyroid', 'thyroid', 'multinodular', 'entire thyroid gland', 'thyroid', 'cervical', 'upper aerodigestive tract', 'vocal cords', 'left parietal', 'left thoracic paraspinal regions', 'neck', 'thyroid', 'intermediate origin at levels II and III', 'thyroid gland', 'scalp', 'follicular variant', 'follicular variant of papillary', 'papillary', 'scalp', 'scalp', 'paraspinal', 'follicular variant', 'papillary', 'thyroid origin', 'chest', 'central compartment', 'neck', 'levels II, III & IV', 'gland', 'thyroglossal', 'thyroid gland', 'follicular variant', 'papillary', 'squamous', 'follicular', 'thyroid', 'squamous component', 'right lobe', 'isthmus', 'thyroid parenchyma', 'left lobe', 'node', 'thyroid', 'follicular variant', 'papillary', 'capsular', 'extrathyroidal', 'papillary', 'squamous', 'fibrous septae over a broad area', 'follicular', 'follicular variant', 'papillary', 'follicular', 'papillary', 'squamous', 'papillary', 'nuclear membrane', 'papillary', 'squamous', 'muscle', 'periphery', 'lymphoid tissue', 'squamous', 'uninvolved lobe', 'One of the fourteen dissected nodes', 'papillary', 'extranodal', 'papillary', 'squamous carcinoma cells']","['goiter', 'swellings', 'thyroid swelling', 'pressure signs', 'symptoms', 'multinodular swelling', 'cervical adenopathy', 'vocal cords were mobile', 'swellings', 'heterogeneous tumor of the thyroid', 'bilateral lymphadenopathy', 'scalp lesion', 'lesion', 'follicular variant of papillary carcinoma', 'papillary carcinoma', 'metastatic deposits', 'scalp lesion', 'paraspinal mass', 'mass', 'papillary carcinoma', 'elevated serum thyroglobulin level', 'primary tumor', 'tumor', 'lesions', 'thyroglossal cyst remnant', 'infiltration of the thyroid gland', 'collision tumor', 'papillary carcinoma', 'squamous carcinoma', 'tumor', 'thyroid tumor', 'primary tumor', 'futile', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'rim of thyroid parenchyma', 'tumor', 'gray-white tumor', 'central irregular cystic area', 'unremarkable', 'unremarkable', 'thyroid mass', 'papillary carcinoma', 'foci of capsular invasion', 'extrathyroidal extension of the tumor', 'papillary carcinoma', 'tumour', 'squamous carcinoma', 'tumours', 'collision tumor', 'follicular variant of papillary carcinoma', 'papillary carcinoma', 'follicular differentiation', 'papillary areas', 'squamous morules', 'nuclear features of papillary carcinoma', 'nuclear crowding', 'nuclear clearing', 'overlapping', 'grooving', 'irregularities of the nuclear membrane', 'tumors', 'zone of transition', 'papillary to squamous carcinoma', 'squamous carcinoma', 'keratin pearls', 'clusters of cohesive cells', 'eosinophilic cytoplasm', 'distinct cytoplasmic borders', 'cytoplasmic borders', 'squamous carcinoma', 'cystic degeneration', 'muscle infiltration', 'remnants of thyroglossal cyst', 'areas of anaplastic carcinoma', 'lymphoid tissue', 'squamous carcinoma', ""Hashimoto's thyroiditis"", 'focus of metastatic papillary carcinoma', 'metastatic papillary carcinoma', 'micrometastasis', 'extranodal invasion', 'disease', 'AJCC', 'TNM', 'papillary carcinoma', 'squamous carcinoma cells', 'independent origins of the tumors']",[],"['65', '4th August 2005']","['thyroid function tests', 'T3', 'T4', 'TSH', 'physical examination', 'Endoscopic and radiological (barium swallow) examination of the upper aerodigestive tract', 'Examination', 'ultrasound of the neck', 'Fine needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid gland', 'biopsy of the scalp lesion', 'biopsy of the paraspinal mass', 'serum thyroglobulin level', 'chest x-ray', 'total thyroidectomy', 'central compartment clearance', 'bilateral selective neck dissections (levels II, III & IV)', 'surgery', 'Histopathology', 'dual histology', 'radio iodine therapy', 'external beam radiotherapy', 'adjuvant treatment', 'surgical therapy', 'total thyroidectomy specimen', 'histology', 'thyroglobulin', 'TTF1', 'Thyroid transcription factor', 'calcitonin', 'cytokeratin', 'thyroglobulin', 'TTF1', 'calcitonin']","['10 years', 'recent', 'since 3 months', 'recent past']"
572,1624824-1,17052345,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1624824.xml,Management approach for recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax in consecutive pregnancies based on clinical and radiographic findings,"Three years before initial presentation, a 19 year-old female experienced the first of seven spontaneous pneumothorax events. By that time, three first trimester miscarriages had occurred (etiology unknown) and she had already undergone an uncomplicated term vaginal delivery of a healthy male infant. The patient did not use alcohol but had a four pack-year smoking history; she had stopped smoking 10d before her first pneumothorax. In the sixth week of her fifth pregnancy, she ""felt sharp right-sided chest pain"" radiating posteriorly accompanied by right arm paraesthesia and dyspnea. This developed while driving her car home. There was no history of trauma, coughing or sneezing episodes. She was brought to the emergency room where she was admitted with the diagnosis of right pneumothorax and a chest tube was placed. Good re-expansion was noted on chest x-ray and the patient was discharged home 2d later.
Approximately two weeks later, a second pneumothorax occurred, this time following a prolonged ""vomiting spell"" secondary to hyperemesis of pregnancy. Evaluation in the emergency room identified a recurrent right pneumothorax. The patient's pulmonary symptoms were less pronounced and it was not considered large enough on chest x-ray to warrant treatment with a chest tube.
A third small right pneumothorax developed at the 10th gestational week that responded well to conservative management and, again, no chest tube was required.
However at ~19 weeks' gestation, the patient sustained a fourth pneumothorax with symptoms similar to that of the first. Chest x-ray revealed approximately 50% collapse of the right lung; she agreed to referral for definitive surgical management. Thoracoscopic excision of right apical lung blebs and mechanical pleurodesis proceeded without complication. The remainder of pregnancy was unremarkable and she was delivered (vaginally) of a viable female infant at term. Of note, the infant was diagnosed with postaxial polydactyly of both hands and one foot. Speech therapy identified ""limited vocabulary for ag"" and developmental delay was diagnosed. A normal karyotype was confirmed in the infant.
At age 21 the patient presented for prenatal care of her sixth pregnancy. She had resumed smoking following her penultimate delivery, but had discontinued cigarettes seven months before this conception. Based on her miscarriage history, additional testing was undertaken during antenatal screening and the patient was found to have protein S deficiency and be heterozygous both for MTHFR and prothrombin G20210A genes. Perinatal consultation determined that anticoagulation therapy was unnecessary based on these findings. Other prenatal laboratory tests and cervical cytology were normal. At approximately five weeks' gestation, the patient experienced ""sharp left chest pain"" and a spontaneous left pneumothorax was diagnosed by chest radiograph. Her previous four pneumothoraces involving the contralateral (right) hemithorax were noted. With supportive care her condition improved and lung re-expansion was achieved without chest tube placement. The patient was discharged home after three days.
For her sixth pneumothorax, she was readmitted to hospital one week later with similar symptoms and left pneumothorax was again identified on chest x-ray. Seven days of supportive care was followed by clinical improvement and radiographically confirmed resolution of the pneumothorax; the patient was discharged from hospital in good condition.
Thirteen days later, the patient described another episode of ""extreme left-sided chest pain"". Left pneumothorax was found on chest x-ray (50% collapse of the left lung). A 20 French chest tube was placed under intravenous sedation (midazolam HCl 2 mg) and lung re-expansion to <5% pneumothorax was achieved. Her hospital course during this seventh pneumothorax was unremarkable except for a mild intercurrent pneumonia (Tmax38.2°C) that responded well to intravenous antibiotics. The patient was discharged home in good condition 19 days later.
At 16 weeks' gestation the patient was admitted to hospital for mini-thoracotomy and thoracoscopically directed mechanical pleurodesis. Apical bleb disease was not prominent, and no obvious source of leak was identified. Recovery was uneventful and complete re-expansion of the lung was achieved.
She experienced no further chest pain and the remainder of her pregnancy was uncomplicated. At 34 5/7 weeks' gestation the patient underwent a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a viable male infant (weight 2336 g, Apgars 9/9). Given her tendency to develop pneumothoraces in pregnancy, the patient requested permanent surgical sterilization and laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation was performed 10 weeks later.

573,1624825-1,17034648,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1624825.xml,Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever in Kosova : a fatal case report,"A previously healthy 8-year-old boy, living in the village Carallukë near Prishtina, Kosova, at the end of May 2004, was caring for livestock in the meadow and bathing in a nearby stream for three consecutive days. His father recalled that the boy had removed a tick from his head about five days before the onset of the disease.
The disease started on 27 May, with chills, myalgia, cough, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, headache and backache. On 28 May, the patient visited the family doctor in an outpatient clinic and received ambulatory care (antibiotics, corticosteroids and antipyretics). On May 29, he visited a pediatrician in a private outpatient clinic in the regional health care centre in Prizren, where broad-range antibiotic therapy was initiated. The doctor recommended hospitalization in case of non-response to therapy, since the patient came from an area in which CCHF was endemic.
On 31 May, the patient was admitted to the Pediatric Clinic at the University Clinical Centre of Kosova, the only tertiary care center for an estimated 2.1 million inhabitants of Kosova. On admission to the clinic, the patient presented with chills, cough, vomiting, headache, backache and pain in both legs.
On initial examination, his vital signs included a body temperature of 40°C, a pulse of 106 beats/min and a respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min. The patient was orientated, without neurological symptoms, but prostrate.
The patient was anaemic with an erythrocyte count and hemoglobin level of 3.4 × 1012 cells/litre (normal range, 4.5 × 1012 - 5.9 × 1012 cells/litre) and 11.5 g/dl (normal range, 13.5 – 17.5 g/dl), respectively. Thrombocytopenia was noted, with a platelet count of 59.2 × 109/litre (normal range, 140 × 109 - 400 × 109/litre). Mild hyperbilirubinemia, hypoproteinemia, and hypoalbuminemia were also present. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics, corticosteroids and antipyretics according to presenting sepsis syndrome and lack of haemorrhagic syndrome in admission to tertiary care center. However, the symptoms did not improve and the patient was not recovering. Moreover, despite a decrease in temperature to 38°C on 2 June, the boy developed epistaxis and gingival bleeding. He was anxious and this was accompanied by uncontrolled screaming. Next day, he was transferred to the Infectious Disease Clinic in a serious condition, not fully conscious, and with diffuse haemorrhagic signs appearing, with purpuric lesions on the trunk and face, and with gingival bleeding. Large ecchymoses appeared at the sites of venepuncture.
The heart was in sinus rhythm: 110 beats/min with weak pulse tone. The abdomen was tender on palpation and the liver and spleen were both palpable. Meningeal signs were slightly positive. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed hepatosplenomegaly and the presence of free liquid in the abdominal cavity, suggestive of hemoperitoneum. Fifty ml of blood was withdrawn from the abdominal cavity by paracentesis. Lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid without increase in cellular elements.
On 4 and 5 June, the patient developed massive hemorrhage with hematemesis, melena, and petechiae. Epistaxis continued and nasal tamponade was undertaken.
The erythrocyte count and hemoglobin level decreased from 3.4 to 2.9 × 1012 cells/litre and from 11.5 to 10.8 g/dl, respectively. An infusion of fresh platelets partially corrected the thrombocytopenia, and the count increased from 59.2 to 96.3, but this later decreased again to 64 × 109/litre.
The alanine transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase levels were 164 U/litre (normal range, 5 to 40 U/litre) and 287 U/liter (normal range, 114 to 240 U/litre), respectively, suggesting liver dysfunction. Activated partial thromboplastin time was 110 seconds(= 60 seconds) and the fibrinogen level was 80 mg/dL(normal value = 110 mg/dL). Coagulation factors (II, V, VII, X) were decreased. Serological tests for hepatitis were negative.
Supportive therapy given to the patient during the course of the disease consisted of hydration, antibiotics and control of temperature. Blood transfusions, two plasma and three platelets solutions were administered to the patient. Ribavirin was not administered because it was not available and the patient had already had a week with symptoms. Despite the treatment, the clinical features deteriorated and the patient died on 6 June due to haemorrhagic shock and pulmonary oedema.
The blood samples drawn on 3 June for serological and molecular testing were referred to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus and Haemorrhagic Fever Reference and Research in Ljubljana, Slovenia. This centre provides laboratory support for the CCHF in Kosova. ELISA tests for CCHF and Hantan-virus were negative in the serum sample, whereas the diagnosis of CCHF was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR from serum and blood obtained during paracentesis.
Complete S segment of the Kosovo Hoti strain was confirmed in Slovenia []. It was deposited under the [GenBank : ].

An ultrasound scan demonstrated a mass in the right iliac fossa but no evidence of hepatic metastases or lymphadenopathy. A plain X-ray film of the chest demonstrated no abnormality. A subsequent barium enema suggested a caecal carcinoma and he was subsequently treated for a pT3 N0 M0 (Dukes B) moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the caecum in July 2002 with a laparoscopically-assisted right hemicolectomy. A complete oncological resection was achieved with clear surgical resection margins of at least 4 centimetres. Fourteen lymph nodes were sampled but no metastatic disease was identified. In concordance with his high risk for microsatellite instability, he underwent 30 sessions of weekly adjuvant 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy with minimal co-morbidity. Eight months post-operatively he was referred to the Urology Department with a 4-month history of irritative lower urinary tract symptoms that had culminated with a short history of frank haematuria.
An initial flexible cystoscopy revealed a solid-looking 2 cm growth on the posterior bladder wall. A subsequent intravenous urogram demonstrated normal upper tracts. He underwent trans-urethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT) through to deep muscle. Histology of the TURBT specimen revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with the following immunoprofile: CK20 and CDX2 +ve, but CK7 -ve. This tissue contained no evidence of extensive cystitis cystica glandularis, intestinal metaplasia or any in-situ component, as may be seen in a primary bladder adenocarcinoma. Comparison was made with the original caecal pathology. Morphologically and immunohistochemically these specimens were identical, suggesting bladder metastases from the primary caecal malignancy (Figure ). A computed tomography (CT) scan at this time revealed no sign of further metastatic disease. The Oncology Department arranged for him to receive CT-staged 3-D conformal multi-fractionated radiotherapy to a total dose of 56 Gray (Gy).
Ten months following the original TURBT, recurrent bladder tumour was found in the same position at check cystoscopy. This was confirmed to be recurrent moderately differentiated intestinal-type adenocarcinoma. Magnetic Resonance scanning revealed a mass involving the right antero-lateral bladder wall and dome extending to the perivesical fat and the right vas deferens. Review of the scans at the Uroradiology multidisciplinary team meeting suggested the lesion to actually be stage pT2b with associated post-TURBT perivesical inflammatory changes. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy or metastatic disease. Furthermore neither recurrent colon tumour nor any direct involvement between bowel and bladder were identified. Subsequently he was offered and underwent a partial cystectomy (Figures and ). There was no evidence of recurrent disease at twelve-month review.","[[45.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['abdominal', 'right iliac fossa', 'hepatic', 'chest', 'caecal', 'caecum', 'lymph nodes', 'lower urinary tract', 'posterior bladder wall', 'upper tracts', 'bladder', 'deep muscle', 'tissue', 'intestinal', 'bladder', 'caecal', 'bladder', 'caecal', 'bladder', 'intestinal-type', 'right antero-lateral bladder wall', 'dome', 'perivesical fat', 'right vas deferens', 'perivesical', 'colon', 'bowel', 'bladder']","['abdominal pain', 'mass', 'mass', 'hepatic metastases', 'lymphadenopathy', 'abnormality', 'caecal carcinoma', 'mucinous adenocarcinoma of the caecum', 'clear surgical resection margins', 'metastatic disease', 'microsatellite instability', 'co-morbidity', 'irritative lower urinary tract symptoms', 'frank haematuria', 'growth', 'normal upper tracts', 'bladder tumour', 'adenocarcinoma', 'cystitis cystica glandularis', 'intestinal metaplasia', 'in-situ component', 'bladder adenocarcinoma', 'bladder metastases', 'caecal malignancy', 'metastatic disease', 'bladder tumour', 'intestinal-type adenocarcinoma', 'mass', 'lesion', 'perivesical inflammatory changes', 'lymphadenopathy', 'metastatic disease', 'colon tumour', 'direct involvement between bowel and bladder', 'disease']","['Fluorouracil', 'FU']","['45', 'July 2002', 'Urology Department']","['ultrasound scan', 'plain X-ray film of the chest', 'barium enema', 'laparoscopically-assisted right hemicolectomy', 'complete oncological resection', 'Fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'flexible cystoscopy', 'intravenous urogram', 'trans-urethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT) through to deep muscle', 'Histology of the TURBT specimen', 'immunoprofile', 'CK20', 'CDX2', 'CK7', 'caecal pathology', 'computed tomography (CT) scan', 'CT-staged 3-D conformal multi-fractionated radiotherapy', 'TURBT', 'cystoscopy', 'Magnetic Resonance scanning', 'partial cystectomy']","['July 2002', 'Eight months', 'post-operatively', '4-month', 'at this time', 'Ten months', 'post-TURBT', 'twelve-month']"

Two hours after surgery, the blood pressure was 85/40 mm Hg, hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, and hematocrit 22.3% (figure ). One day later, he reported transient horizontal diplopia when he looked to the right, and the oculomotility was normal. The visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally, pupillary reflexes were normal, and the intraocular pressure by applanation tonometry was 15 mmHg bilaterally. Slit-lamp examination showed a minimal cataract. Funduscopy showed a congenitally anomalous optic nerve head with small cup-to-disc ratio and no papillary edema.
Two days after surgery he had transient episodes of blurred vision bilaterally and no diplopia. Four days after surgery, upon awakening he experienced sudden and painless amaurosis in both eyes with nausea and vomiting. On examination, he had no light perception bilaterally. Funduscopic examination revealed that both optic discs were swollen with small hemorrhages. Further, an area of parapapillary retinal infarction was present in the left eye (figure ). Computerized axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans of the head and orbits were performed and the results were normal. Electrolyte levels were within normal limits (sodium 140 mEq/L, potassium 3.8 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L). There were no responses on visual evoked potentials in both eyes.

Clinical examination revealed a well-preserved young male with stable vitals. He was afebrile. Auscultation of the chest revealed coarse crackles over the left upper and middle lobes. The rest of the clinical examination was unremarkable.
The chest x-ray showed a well-defined large opacity in the upper lobe of the left lung. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed a well defined solid lesion measuring 7 × 5.2 × 5 cm and occupying the anterior segment of the left upper lobe and the superior segment of the lingular lobe (Fig. ). It appeared to be adherent to the left anterolateral subcostal pleura laterally and the mediastinal pleura medially, starting at the level of the main pulmonary trunk and extending along the left ventricular surface. The lesion showed heterogenous density containing soft tissue elements, fat, cystic areas, and foci of calcification, which is the classic imaging appearance of a benign teratoma. Perilesional inflammatory changes were present. No mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, or thickening was noted.
CT guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed sheets of degenerating acute inflammatory cells and anucleate squamous cells. A histological evaluation was suggested.
Pulmonary function tests showed mild restriction in the forced vital capacity. Routine hematological tests and abdominal sonography was within normal limits. Mantoux test was negative.
Thoracotomy and enucleation of the lesion was performed. The lesion, measuring 7.5 × 6 × 5.5 cm, was well circumscribed, encapsulated, and partially cystic and filled with hair and sebaceous material (Fig ). Microscopic examination showed a variety of cell lines (Fig. ) consisting of squamous epithelium and sebaceous glands (Fig. ), cartilage (Fig. ), pancreatic tissue (Fig. ), gastric glands (Fig. ).

She had been diagnosed of SSc ten years ago. Before surgery she was receiving deflazacort 13.5 mg/day every other day, pentoxifyllin 400 mg/day, acetylsalicylic acid 300 mg/day, cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day, colchicine 1 mg/day and risedronate sodium 35 mg/week. Deflazacort, acetylsalicylic acid, cyclophosphamide and colchicine were quited preoperatively.
On her physical examination, she has waxy, smooth and tight skin, decreased oral aperture (3 cm) and thyromental distance was 6 cm, the patient was almost bedridden secondary to severe flexion contractures of all four extremities. She had borderline hypertension (150/90 mmHg). She had chronic cough with bilaterally reduced lung sounds. Inspection of her back revealed kyphoscoliosis. Because of severe dyspne, she had echocardiyagram, the result was compatible with normal left ventricular size and contractility, minimal right atrial enlargement, minimal dilated hypo kinetic right ventricle. Bibasal pulmonary fibrosis was detected on her chest radiogram. The arterial blood gases and pulmonary function tests result were as fallow; fraction of inspired oxygen 0.21, PaO2 : 88.6 mmHg, PaCO2 : 18.8 mmHg, and pH: 7,51; forced expiratory volume in 1st second (FEV1):1,5 L, forced vital capacity (FVC): 1.9 L, total lung capacity 2,95 L. The liver and renal function tests were normal. The complete blood caunt was as follows. Hemoglobin:10.5 g/dl, platelet (plt) : 202 K/uL, protrombine time (PT):11.88 s (range:11.5–15 s) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): 23.22s (range: 20–33 s).
The patient received 150 mg of ranitidine and 10 mg of metoclopramide thirty minutes before the regional block. In the operation room, arterial blood pressure (BP) was 153/92 mmHg, and her heart rate (HR)was 95 bpm. A 16 gauge venflon catheter was inserted into a vein in the dorsum of right hand, and 500 ml of 0.9 % NaCl solution was infused over the next 20 min. Standard monitoring was used throughout the procedure, including continuous ECG (Lead II), heart rate, non-invasive arterial blood pressure measured in every five minutes and continuous pulse oximetry. A senior experienced anesthesiologist performed the combined spinal- epidural (CSE) anesthesia. The patient was placed in the left side position and a disposable 16 gauge Toughy needle (portex) was introduced trough the L2/L3 epidural space under full aseptic condition without difficulty. The epidural space was located 5 cm from the skin via the loss of resistance technique with the midline approach. Then after 25 gauge 123 mm Whitacre spinal needle was inserted through the epidural needle, and free – flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was observed. Hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% 12.5 mg was injected over 30 sec without further CSF aspiration (speed of intrathecal injection approximately 0.05 ml.sec-1). Epidural catheter was inserted for the management of postoperative pain. The catheter was secured at 3 cm in the epidural space. Nothing was injected trough the catheter at this stage. The patient was kept in the left side position for 15 min.
The sensory block was evaluated by the pinprick test (22-gauge hypodermic needle), whereas motor block was evaluated by a modified Bromage scale (0 : no motor block; 1: hip block; 2: hip and knee block; 3 : hip, knee and ankle block). Ten minutes after the injection of local anesthetic solution, the sensory block level reached bilaterally to T8 dermatome level and the motor block level reched to Bromage 3 on both lower extremities.
Then, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table and surgery started at the 15th min. In order to avoid the vasospasm of Reynaud's phenomenon; the temperature of the operating room was kept at 24°C and intra arterial cannula wasn't inserted.
Estimated blood loss during 70 min. surgery was minimal (approximately 250 ml). In addition to infused metilprednisolon 20 mg/six hours and regular insulin 8 IU/six hours, total fluids given during surgery was 2500 ml of 0.9% NaCl. There was no remarkable variation on hemodynamic and SpO2 values with respect to baseline values throughout the procedure.
After the spinal injection, the motor block was completely regressed at 195th min and the sensory block was regressed at 225th min. Because the patient appeared to be pain free in recovery room, nothing was given through the epidural catheter. The patient had been monitorized in post anesthetic care unit for 2 days, and catheter was removed on postoperative day 2. Then, she was transferred to the orthopedic ward. She was discharged from the hospital at postoperative day 14 uneventfully.","[[68.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['left femur', 'hip', 'skin', 'oral', 'all four extremities', 'lung', 'back', 'left ventricular', 'right atrial', 'right ventricle', 'Bibasal pulmonary', 'chest', 'arterial', 'pulmonary', 'lung', 'liver', 'renal', 'arterial', 'heart', 'vein in the dorsum of right hand', 'heart', 'arterial', 'spinal', 'L2/L3 epidural space', 'epidural space', '5 cm from the skin', 'skin', 'spinal', 'epidural', 'intrathecal', 'epidural space', 'hip', 'hip', 'knee', 'hip', 'knee', 'ankle', 'bilaterally to T8 dermatome level', 'T8 dermatome level', 'Bromage 3 on both lower extremities', 'intra arterial', 'spinal']","['traumatic left femur fracture', 'SSc', 'waxy', 'smooth', 'tight', 'decreased oral aperture', 'bedridden', 'flexion contractures of all four extremities', 'hypertension', 'cough', 'bilaterally reduced lung sounds', 'kyphoscoliosis', 'dyspne', 'normal left ventricular size and contractility', 'right atrial enlargement', 'dilated hypo kinetic right ventricle', 'Bibasal pulmonary fibrosis', 'CSF', 'pain', 'sensory block', 'motor block', 'motor block', 'hip block', 'block', 'block', 'sensory block level reached bilaterally to T8 dermatome level', 'motor block level reched to Bromage 3 on both lower extremities', 'vasospasm', ""vasospasm of Reynaud's phenomenon"", ""Reynaud's phenomenon"", 'remarkable variation', 'motor block', 'sensory block', 'pain']","['deflazacort', 'pentoxifyllin', 'acetylsalicylic acid', 'cyclophosphamide', 'colchicine', 'risedronate sodium', 'Deflazacort', 'acetylsalicylic acid', 'cyclophosphamide', 'colchicine', 'ranitidine', 'metoclopramide', 'NaCl', 'bupivacaine', 'metilprednisolon', 'regular insulin', 'fluids', 'NaCl']","['68', 'orthopedic ward']","['height', 'weighing', 'total hip arthroplasty', 'physical examination', 'thyromental distance', 'echocardiyagram', 'chest radiogram', 'arterial blood gases', 'pulmonary function tests', 'fraction of inspired oxygen', 'PaO2', 'PaCO2', 'pH', 'forced expiratory volume in 1st second', 'forced expiratory volume in 1st second (FEV1)', 'forced vital capacity (FVC)', 'total lung capacity', 'liver and renal function tests', 'complete blood caunt', 'Hemoglobin', 'platelet', 'platelet (plt)', 'arterial blood pressure (BP)', 'heart rate', 'heart rate (HR)', 'HR', '16 gauge venflon catheter was inserted into a vein in the dorsum of right hand', 'ECG', 'heart rate', 'non-invasive arterial blood pressure', 'pulse oximetry', 'combined spinal- epidural (CSE) anesthesia', 'a disposable 16 gauge Toughy needle (portex) was introduced trough the L2/L3 epidural space under full aseptic condition without difficulty', '25 gauge 123 mm Whitacre spinal needle was inserted through the epidural needle', 'Hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% 12.5 mg was injected over 30 sec without further CSF aspiration', 'CSF aspiration', 'intrathecal injection', 'Epidural catheter was inserted', 'catheter was secured at 3 cm in the epidural space', 'injected trough the catheter', 'pinprick test', 'modified Bromage scale', 'Bromage scale', 'local anesthetic solution', 'surgery', 'temperature', 'intra arterial cannula', 'Estimated blood loss', 'surgery', 'hemodynamic', 'SpO2', 'spinal injection', 'epidural catheter', 'post anesthetic care', 'catheter was removed']","['ten years ago', 'preoperatively', 'preoperatively', 'preoperatively', 'preoperatively', 'postoperative', 'postoperative day 2']"
578,1634746-1,17067398,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1634746.xml,A multinodular goiter as the initial presentation of a renal cell carcinoma harbouring a novel VHL mutation,"A 54-yr-old Caucasian male was referred for evaluation of a rapidly increasing neck tumor noticed for the first time four months earlier. He complained of sporadic dysphagia without weight loss. He was a heavy smoker until recently but had no previous medical history. He worked as a house painter, for seven years, in his thirties. The physical examination revealed an asymmetric multinodular goiter with a left dominant nodule with firm consistency and no palpable regional nodes. Serum TSH was 1.3 μUI/ml (normal: 0.5–4.7 μUI/ml), T4 7.3 μg/dl (normal: 5.4–11 μg/dl) and T3 126 ng/dl (normal: 52–160 ng/dl). Antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibodies were negative. A thyroid ultrasound demonstrated a multinodular gland with the right and left lobes measuring 6 × 4 × 3 cm and 9 × 7 × 6 cm respectively. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck showed a slight tracheal deviation to the right without compression. A Tc-99 m scintigraphy disclosed irregular uptake in both lobes of the thyroid and a large cold nodule in the left lobe. FNAC from both lobes revealed a clear-cell carcinoma with an immunocytochemical profile suggestive of a secondary tumor from the kidney (refer to section pathology).
FNAC results prompted a clinical and radiographic investigation. An abdominal CT scan revealed a tumor of the left kidney measuring in greatest diameter 10 cm. Bone scan, chest computed tomography scan, liver ultrasound and laboratory data were normal and there was no evidence of other distant metastases.
Initial treatment included a left radical nephrectomy and a total thyroidectomy. One year later, there was evidence for cervical nodal metastases. The patient was then submitted to right radical neck dissection with internal jugular vein ligation and section of spinal accessory nerve and left modified radical neck dissection type III. At histological examination, only right nodes were metastatic.
Both thyroid lobes were sampled. Smears were air dried and acetone fixed and stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG) and Papanicolaou (PAP) stains, respectively. An additional sample was fixed in formalin and processed as a cell-block using the Shandon Cytoblock® Kit (Thermo Electron Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Cell block (CB) sections were stained with hematoxilin-eosin. Immunocytochemistry was performed on CB sections, using an avidin-biotin method with diaminobenzidine as the chromogen for the following antibodies: thyroglobulin, calcitonin, vimentin, CD10, TTF1 (Dakocytomation, Denmark A/S) and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (Zymed Laboratories, Inc, San Francisco, CA).
Smears consisted of a clear, large cell neoplasia with large nuclei, prominent nucleoli and finely vacuolated cytoplasm, with indistinct borders. The tumor cells were arranged in aggregates of variable size and shape, many of them centered by thin walled capillaries. This intimate relationship of neoplastic cells and vessels was better appreciated on cell-block sections. These cells were immunoreactive for pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3), vimentin and CD10 and were negative for thyroglobulin, thyroid transcription factor1 (TTF1) and calcitonin (Fig. ).
The smear pattern together with the immunocytochemical profile was consistent with the diagnosis of secondary tumor, most probably from renal origin.
The nephrectomy specimen showed a renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type. It was classified as Fuhrman 3 and showed extra renal local spread and no vascular invasion.
The thyroid gland was multinodular and all the nodules consisted of metastasis of a clear cell neoplasia. The histological pattern was similar to the renal tumor. Immunocytochemical study was performed using the same antibodies that were tested on cytological samples with identical results.
RNA from cells left inside of the needle used for FNAC was isolated with the QuickPrep micro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Half of the RNA was reversed transcribed with Superscript (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in 20 μl reaction volume with random primers and cDNA kept frozen. To screen for VHL mutations in thyroid aspirates, 2,5 μl of first-strand cDNA was used as a template for PCR using primers designed by us (F-5'-TCAGAGATGCAGGGACACAC-3', R-5'-TGACGATGTCCAGTCTCCTG-3').
Somatic DNA was extracted from samples corresponding to renal carcinoma and thyroid metastases obtained during surgeries and immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen until nucleic acid extraction using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Genomic DNA was also obtained from peripheral venous blood and isolated by a manual method adapted from Bowtell [].
DNA samples were amplified by PCR using primers previously described []. The screening of VHL mutations was performed by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP). To further characterize the abnormal pattern observed in the SSCP, PCR purified products were either sequenced directly using the ABI PRISM® BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyser or subcloned into pGEM®-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, USA), and subsequently sequenced using the ABI PRISM® BigDye™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyser. Restriction analysis, using the restriction endonuclease BstZ17 I (New England BioLabs®, Inc., Beverly, USA) was also performed.
The same alteration, a heterozygous 680delA (codon 156/exon 3) of the VHL gene was identified in thyroid aspirates, renal carcinoma, thyroid metastases and lymph node metastases. It causes a frame-shift and creates a premature stop predicting a truncated pVHL (Fig. ). Constitutional DNA (peripheral venous blood) was analyzed and did not show the mutation. No other alterations were observed in exons 1 and 2 of VHL.","[[54.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['neck', 'thyroid', 'multinodular gland', 'right and left lobes', 'neck', 'tracheal', 'both lobes of the thyroid', 'left lobe', 'both lobes', 'kidney', 'abdominal', 'left kidney', 'Bone', 'chest', 'liver', 'left radical', 'cervical nodal', 'right radical neck', 'internal jugular vein', 'spinal', 'spinal accessory nerve', 'radical neck', 'right nodes', 'Both thyroid lobes', 'CB sections', 'neoplastic cells', 'vessels', 'renal origin', 'renal', 'renal', 'thyroid gland', 'renal', 'thyroid', 'renal', 'thyroid', 'peripheral venous blood', 'thyroid', 'renal', 'thyroid', 'lymph node', 'peripheral venous', 'exons 1 and 2 of VHL']","['neck tumor', 'dysphagia', 'weight loss', 'multinodular goiter', 'left dominant nodule', 'regional nodes', 'multinodular gland', 'tracheal deviation', 'compression', 'irregular uptake', 'cold nodule', 'clear-cell carcinoma', 'secondary tumor', 'tumor of the left kidney', 'distant metastases', 'cervical nodal metastases', 'metastatic', 'large cell neoplasia', 'large nuclei', 'nucleoli', 'vacuolated cytoplasm', 'indistinct borders', 'tumor cells', 'intimate relationship of neoplastic cells and vessels', 'cells were immunoreactive', 'cells were immunoreactive for pancytokeratin', 'secondary tumor', 'renal cell carcinoma', 'extra renal local spread', 'vascular invasion', 'thyroid gland was multinodular', 'nodules', 'metastasis', 'metastasis of a clear cell neoplasia', 'renal tumor', 'VHL mutations in thyroid aspirates', 'renal carcinoma', 'thyroid metastases', 'VHL mutations', 'heterozygous 680delA (codon 156/exon 3) of the VHL gene', 'thyroid aspirates', 'renal carcinoma', 'thyroid metastases', 'lymph node metastases', 'metastases', 'frame-shift', 'premature stop', 'truncated pVHL', 'mutation', 'alterations', 'VHL']",['liquid nitrogen'],"['54', 'house painter', 'San Francisco', 'Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK', 'Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA', 'Life Technologies, Inc', 'Gaithersburg, MD, USA', 'Bowtell', 'Madison, USA', 'Foster City, CA, USA', 'New England BioLabs®, Inc', 'Beverly']","['physical examination', 'Serum TSH', 'T4', 'T3', 'Antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibodies', 'thyroid ultrasound', 'computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck', 'Tc-99 m scintigraphy', 'FNAC', 'immunocytochemical profile', 'pathology', 'FNAC', 'abdominal CT scan', 'Bone scan', 'chest computed tomography scan', 'liver ultrasound', 'laboratory data', 'treatment', 'left radical nephrectomy', 'total thyroidectomy', 'right radical neck dissection', 'internal jugular vein ligation', 'section of spinal accessory nerve', 'left modified radical neck dissection', 'histological examination', 'Both thyroid lobes were sampled', 'acetone fixed and stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG) and Papanicolaou (PAP) stains', 'additional sample was fixed in formalin and processed as a cell-block using the Shandon Cytoblock® Kit', 'Cell block (CB) sections were stained with hematoxilin-eosin', 'Immunocytochemistry', 'antibodies', 'thyroglobulin', 'calcitonin', 'vimentin', 'CD10', 'TTF1', 'cytokeratin AE1/AE3', 'Smears', 'pancytokeratin', 'vimentin', 'CD10', 'thyroglobulin', 'thyroid transcription factor1', 'TTF1', 'calcitonin', 'smear pattern', 'immunocytochemical profile', 'nephrectomy', 'Immunocytochemical study', 'cytological samples', 'RNA from cells left inside of the needle', 'RNA from cells left inside of the needle used for FNAC', 'QuickPrep micro mRNA Purification Kit', 'Half of the RNA was reversed transcribed with Superscript', 'screen for VHL mutations in thyroid aspirates', 'PCR', 'surgeries', 'immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen', 'nucleic acid extraction', 'Genomic DNA', 'DNA samples', 'screening', 'screening of VHL mutations', 'single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis', 'SSCP', 'SSCP', 'PCR', 'Restriction analysis', 'restriction endonuclease BstZ17 I', 'DNA', 'peripheral venous blood']",['four months earlier']

He had extensive cutaneous lesions on the face, forehead, upper torso, mid-abdomen, left arm and left flank. He had been initially diagnosed with AIDS when he presented with vomiting and bloody diarrhea, and was found via endoscopy to have KS involving the colon. HIV serology was positive and his CD4 T-lymphocyte count at diagnosis was 30 cells/mm3. He was subsequently found via bronchoscopy to have pulmonary KS.
Pleuroperitoneal shunt placement and thoracic duct ligation were performed for management of chylothoraces. Since placement of the shunt, he developed ascites with subcutaneous extravassation of lymph that was associated with xanthogranulomatous bile lakes (Figure ). He received diuretic therapy and medium-chain triglyceride dietary supplementation with only temporary improvement of his ascites. He was requiring paracentesis every 4–6 weeks for resolution of respiratory distress.
He received highly active antiretroviral therapy (stavudine, lamivudine and nelfinavir) and his HIV viral load became undetectable. His KS was treated initially with liposomal daunorubicin and then paclitaxel. He was then switched to SU5416 (an angiogenesis inhibitor) to which he had a temporary response. He was placed on palliative paclitaxel and died of progressive KS about 18 months later.
His pleural and lung biopsies showed dilated pleuropulmonary lymphatics (Figure ) with interstitial pulmonary extravassation of lymph. The biopsy revealed a multifocal increase in spindle-shaped cells with neo-angiogenesis originating from dilated lymphatics, associated with scattered lymphocytes and hemosiderin-laden macrophages, resembling early stage KS (Figure ).
Immunohistochemistry was performed using HHV8 associated Latent Nuclear Antigen-1 (LNA-1; Advanced Biotechnologies, Columbia, MD) monoclonal antibody, as well as dual-color immunostaining with the vascular endothelial marker CD34 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and lymphatic specific endothelial marker D2-40 (Signet, Dedham, MA). Spindle-shaped and endothelial cells in these early KS-appearing regions were strongly HHV8 positive (Figure ) and immunoreactive for both D2-40 and CD34 (Figure ). Non-lesional lymphatics were HHV8 negative and only D2-40 positive.

A diagnosis of LCH had been made at the age of 3 years. The first lesion was on a cervical lymph node. After the administration of chemotherapy with vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and predonisone, the lesion resolved. When the patient was 11 years old, he restarted chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and 6-mercaptopurine) because of a recurrent lesion in the femur bone and along the pituitary-thalmic axis. At this time, he noticed a painful nodule, 5 mm in diameter, which was elastic, hard, and reddish, with a smooth surface (Fig. ). Surgical resection of the nodule in the foreskin, without amputation or circumcision, was performed. Histologically, the lesions consisted of diffuse infiltrates of Langerhans cells with indented or grooved nuclei and eosinophilic or pale cytoplasm. Also present were various numbers of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. The lesions represented stromal edema and mild fibrosis. Their surface was focally eroded. Scattered vascular proliferation was present (Fig. ). Both S-100 protein and CD1a were immunoreactive in the majority of these Langerhans cells (Fig. , ).

Radiographic examination revealed the presence of a solitary nodule of the lung (right upper field), with morphologic features more consistent with metastasis. The patient mentioned a persistent, mild lumbar pain for the last two years and she had received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Upon a detailed physical examination a barely palpable mass at the lumbar area was noted. The reflexes of the lower extremities were normal. Laboratory examination showed no abnormalities, and all tumor markers had normal values. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT-scan revealed an ill-defined osteolytic lesion of the L 5 vertebra with a splotch calcification, cortical permeation and extension to the surrounding soft tissues. In chest CT-scan the lung nodule was of similar consistency. An attempt to biopsy the lung nodule was made, but the material obtained was insufficient for diagnosis.
The patient underwent surgery in the spine, due to the danger of collapse of the L5 vertebra and the mass was exsiced.
The histopathological examination revealed a moderately cellular multilobular neoplasm with chondroid and myxoid matrix and focal necrosis. Under high power view, multicellular lacunae of chondrocytes with moderate nuclear pleomorphism and hypercromasia were observed (Fig. ). Mitotic figures were numerous. The tumor was diagnosed as chondrosarcoma, grade II. On immunohistochemical examination > 25 % of the neoplastic cells exhibited nuclear immunoreactivity for the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Fig. ).

Transthoracic echocardiography showed a stenotic bicuspid aortic valve, with a valve area of 0.6 sq.cm. and a peak gradient at rest of 90 mm Hg. His pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 50 mm Hg. A lesion attached to the inferior surface of the leaflets and extending onto the basal septum was visualised.
He was referred for urgent aortic valve replacement following stabilisation with diuretics. At operation, the lesion was found attached to the inferior surface of his bicuspid aortic valve. It abutted but was not attached to his ventricular septum. The valve and the lesion were excised intact and the valve replaced with a 23 mm mechanical prosthesis.
The patient had a prolonged post-operative phase complicated by respiratory infection. However, he went on to make an excellent recovery and was discharged home.","[[72.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['atrial', 'left ventricular', 'left ventricular', 'Transthoracic', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'valve area', 'pulmonary artery', 'inferior surface of the leaflets', 'basal septum', 'aortic', 'inferior surface of his bicuspid aortic valve', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'aortic valve', 'ventricular septum', 'valve', 'valve', 'respiratory']","['shortness of breath', 'palpitations', 'atrial fibrillation', 'left ventricular failure', 'hypertensive diabetic', 'poorly controlled blood sugar', 'blood sugar', 'ejection systolic murmur', 'left ventricular failure', 'stenotic bicuspid aortic valve', 'lesion', 'lesion', 'abutted', 'lesion', 'respiratory infection']",[],"['72', 'emergency department']","['blood sugar', 'Examination', 'diuretics', 'Transthoracic echocardiography', 'peak gradient', 'pulmonary artery systolic pressure', 'aortic valve replacement', 'diuretics', 'valve and the lesion were excised intact', 'valve replaced with a 23 mm mechanical prosthesis']",['post-operative']
583,1634852-1,17054802,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1634852.xml,Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection in an immunocompetent pregnant woman,"A 26-year-old pregnant woman presented to the Division of Infectious Diseases at Korea university Guro hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea (ROK) with history of fever and abdominal pain for a week. She was a healthy hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier that was vertically transmitted from her mother. The patient was in the 13th week of her first pregnancy, and she did not take any medicine at all. The patient was admitted for work-up of her febrile condition. On admission, her vital signs were body temperature 38.1°C, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, and pulse rate 86 times/minute. She complained of generalized weakness, loose stool, night sweating, and dry cough. On physical examination, mild right upper quadrant tenderness and decreased breathing sound on the right lower lung field were noted. Initial laboratory investigations showed mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL and a platelet count of 232 × 103 platelets/mm3. White blood cell (WBC) count was not elevated with 6,100 cells/mm3. Aminotransferase levels were elevated with levels of 127/117 IU/L in AST/ALT respectively. Alkaline phosphatase level (207 IU/L) was also increased. Serologic tests for HIV, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) were negative. Activity of HBV was not increased: hepatitis e antigen (-), hepatitis e antibody (+), HBV DNA (1.0 pg/mL). The patient's chest X-ray showed numerous tiny nodular opacities on both lungs, and high-resolution computed tomography of the chest demonstrated numerous randomly distributed nodules (Fig. ). Tuberculin test showed anergy. Those findings were compatible with miliary tuberculosis.
In ROK, tuberculosis is still highly prevalent, so the patient was initially suspected of having miliary tuberculosis in the lung. Anti-tuberculosis medication was started with isoniazid (300 mg qd), rifampin (600 mg qd), ethambutol (1.2 g qd), and pyrazinamide (1.5 g qd). Aminotransferase levels were not elevated further during the course of anti-tuberculosis medication. Sputum induction with hypertonic saline was performed because the patient only had intermittent dry cough and scanty sputum. The sputum study was negative for Mycobacterium on Ziehl-Neelson stain.
High fever persisted despite anti-tuberculosis medication. On day 15 of anti-tuberculosis medication, the patient's condition was aggravated; she suffered from severe dyspnea and hyperemesis. Fetal distress was suspected, forcing us to terminate the pregnancy. Pathologic specimens obtained from the placenta demonstrated many acid fast bacilli in Ziehl-Neelson stain (Fig. ). However, the patient was still febrile despite the termination of pregnancy and continued anti-tuberculosis medication. The authors believed that an immunologic response might have been responsible for the high fever and added oral steroid (oral prednisone; 1 mg/kg) to the patient's medication. The patient felt better and was no longer febrile. The patient was subsequently discharged from the hospital with those medications.
During outpatient follow-up, the patient complained of frequent episodes of fever and exertional dyspnea even though she was taking anti-tuberculosis medication. Chest X-ray revealed that the pulmonary disease worsened with multiple nodules in the entire lung. On day 45 of anti-tuberculosis medication, results from the initial series of sputum mycobacterial cultures on ogawa medium were available; Mycobacterium other than tuberculosis (MOTT) was demonstrated repeatedly. Result from placenta was same also. The patient's chest X-ray showed no improvement since discharge from the hospital, with persistent multiple tiny nodules in both lung fields. The medication was changed to clarithromycin (500 mg bid), rifampin (600 mg qd), ofloxacin (300 mg bid), and ethambutol (1.2 g qd).
On day 60 of anti-MOTT medication, all the patient's symptoms were dramatically improved. Chest X-ray was nearly cleared up, and liver function tests resolved completely also. On day 105 of anti-MOTT medication, mycobacterial speciation culture report from sputum and placenta specimens revealed Mycobacterium avium intracellurare with isoniazid, ethambutol, and Para-aminosalicylic acid resistance. The drug regimen was adjusted in accordance with results from the antibiotic susceptibility test: clarithromycin, rifampin, and ofloxacin. The patient is on the 10 months of the new drug regimen with continuous improvement of her condition. Follow-up HIV serology was negative and the result of tuberculin test was converted to strong positive (2.5 cm sized induration), which were performed after 10 month medication (Fig. ). No specific abnormality was noted on gynecologic examination, endoscopy, breast and abdominal sonogram.","[[26.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['abdominal', 'body', 'right upper quadrant', 'right lower lung field', 'chest', 'both lungs', 'chest', 'lung', 'placenta', 'Chest', 'pulmonary', 'entire lung', 'placenta', 'chest', 'both lung fields', 'Chest', 'liver', 'breast', 'abdominal']","['pregnant', 'fever', 'abdominal pain', 'healthy hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier', 'HBV', 'pregnancy', 'febrile condition', 'generalized weakness', 'loose stool', 'night sweating', 'dry cough', 'right upper quadrant tenderness', 'decreased breathing sound', 'anemia', 'nodular opacities', 'nodules', 'anergy', 'miliary tuberculosis', 'tuberculosis', 'miliary tuberculosis', 'cough', 'scanty sputum', 'Mycobacterium', 'fever', 'condition was aggravated', 'dyspnea', 'hyperemesis', 'Fetal distress', 'pregnancy', 'acid fast bacilli', 'febrile', 'immunologic response', 'fever', 'felt better', 'febrile', 'fever', 'dyspnea', 'pulmonary disease', 'nodules', 'Mycobacterium other than tuberculosis', 'improvement', 'nodules', 'symptoms', 'Mycobacterium avium intracellurare', 'isoniazid, ethambutol, and Para-aminosalicylic acid resistance', 'condition', 'induration', 'specific abnormality']","['isoniazid', 'rifampin', 'ethambutol', 'pyrazinamide', 'hypertonic saline', 'prednisone', 'clarithromycin', 'rifampin', 'ofloxacin', 'ethambutol', 'clarithromycin', 'rifampin', 'ofloxacin']","['26', 'Korea university Guro hospital', 'Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'ROK', '13th']","['medicine', 'work-up', 'vital signs', 'body temperature', 'blood pressure', 'pulse rate', 'physical examination', 'laboratory', 'hemoglobin level', 'platelet count', 'White blood cell (WBC) count', 'AST/ALT', 'Alkaline phosphatase level', 'Serologic tests', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'HCV', 'hepatitis A virus', 'HAV', 'Activity of HBV', 'hepatitis e antigen', 'hepatitis e antibody', 'HBV DNA', 'chest X-ray', 'high-resolution computed tomography of the chest', 'Tuberculin test', 'Anti-tuberculosis medication', 'Aminotransferase levels', 'anti-tuberculosis medication', 'Sputum induction with hypertonic saline', 'sputum study', 'Ziehl-Neelson stain', 'anti-tuberculosis medication', 'anti-tuberculosis medication', 'terminate the pregnancy', 'Pathologic specimens obtained from the placenta', 'Ziehl-Neelson stain', 'termination of pregnancy', 'anti-tuberculosis medication', 'steroid', 'medication', 'medications', 'anti-tuberculosis medication', 'Chest X-ray', 'anti-tuberculosis medication', 'sputum mycobacterial cultures', 'chest X-ray', 'medication', 'anti-MOTT medication', 'Chest X-ray', 'liver function tests', 'anti-MOTT medication', 'mycobacterial speciation culture', 'sputum and placenta specimens', 'drug regimen', 'antibiotic susceptibility test', 'drug regimen', 'HIV serology', 'tuberculin test', 'medication', 'gynecologic examination', 'endoscopy', 'breast and abdominal sonogram']","['a week', 'a week', '13th week', 'On day 15', 'On day 45', 'On day 105']"

He was on medication for hypertension and moderate aortic regurgitation for years with good control. We palpated a non-tender, irreducible and doughy mass over the right inguinal region. The laboratory data was within the normal limits including the tumor marker(CEA). Abdominal ultrasound showed an irregular cystic hypoechoic lesion over the right lower quadrant. CT scan revealed an irregular hypodense lesion with fat stranding near the cecum without obviously enlarged lymph nodes(Figure ). The right inguinal canal was occupied by a heterogenous lesion with adjacent fat stranding suggestive of appendiceal mucocele with rupture(Figure ). We noted that no leakage of oral intake of iodinated, water-soluble contrast medium from the cecum or appendix into the peritoneal cavity(Figure ). We postulated no persistent leakage of mucin from the appendix. A gentle colonoscopic examination was performed. It revealed a 2 cm in diameter sessile polyp in the descending colon(Figure ). Polypectomy was performed and the pathology revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with muscle layer invasion(Figure ). At laparotomy, a segmental resection of the descending colon with excision of the mesenteric lymph nodes, appendectomy(Figure ), removal of yellowish mucoid jelly(Figure ) and closure of the internal ring of the right inguinal canal were performed.

He completed radical radiotherapy in December, 2001, and achieved complete remission afterwards. Although baseline plasma EBV DNA was not available, patient had undetectable plasma EBV DNA which was measured within one week after radiotherapy.
Upon a routine follow-up in August, 2002, the patient developed with an asymptomatic rise in the plasma EBV DNA level at 129,437 copies/ml. A subsequent FDG-positron emission and computered tomography fusion scan (FDG-PET-CT) showed a 4 cm hypermetabolic solitary metastasis in the right lobe of liver with a FDG standard uptake value (SUV) of 7.6 (Figure ). Following treatment with six courses of paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy, his plasma EBV DNA level fell to undetectable level, and a subsequent PET-CT performed immediately after completion of chemotherapy confirmed a reduction in the size and SUV of the liver metastasis (Figure ). A right hepatectomy was performed at two weeks after the end of chemotherapy, and pathological examination of the resected specimen showed necrotic tissues without any evidence of viable malignant cells.
The patient enjoyed a disease-free period of about nine months until a second disease relapse in September, 2003, when he was found to have asymptomatic rise in plasma EBV-DNA level to 678 copies/ml. A subsequent PET-CT confirmed multiple hyper-metabolic recurrences in the liver, lung and pancreatic head (Figure ). After 2 courses of second-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin, his plasma EBV DNA level fell to undetectable level which coincided with complete disappearance of metastatic lesions (i.e. complete remission) on PET-CT in October, 03 (Figure ). He completed a total of 4 cycles of gemcitabine and carboplatin and remained disease-free until 4 months later in February 2004, when he developed a third relapse which was heralded by an asymptomatic and progressive rise in plasma EBV-DNA levels from 56 to 329 copies/ml over a 2 month period. A PET-CT performed in April 2004 confirmed recurrence in the liver and pancreatic head. He was re-treated with 6 cycles of gemcitabine and carboplatin chemotherapy, and again, his plasma EBV-DNA level became undetectable and PET/CT showed complete remission.

She reported a two-year history of intermittent colicky abdominal pain. At operation, a 5 cm ileal tumour was found, situated 10 cm proximal from the ileocaecal valve. This was resected. Histopathological assessment confirmed a carcinoid tumour with locally involved nodes (three positive lymph nodes). Nine years later, she re-presented with right-sided abdominal pain, a two-week history of diarrhoea, and a two month history of episodes of her face getting ""hot and blushing"". A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a liver nodule (30 mm diameter) and a mass (60 × 40 mm) in the right iliac fossa, which was in contact with a small intestinal loop (Figure ). Octreotide scanning (indium-111 labelled pentreotide scintigraphy) demonstrated that the liver, the ascending colon, the right iliac fossa, and an area in the superior half abdomen had positive foci (Figure ). In addition, the tumour marker CA-125 was raised (40.5 U/ml)) and so were the urine levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) (41.2 mg/day). Percutaneous biopsy of the liver lesion confirmed a carcinoid tumour.
At operation in January 2003, peritoneal carcinomatosis was discovered with tumoural implants over the greater omentum, the parietal peritoneum, the left ovary, the terminal ileum (with stenotic and fibrous lesion), and a liver metastasis in segment IV. The peritoneal deposits, left ovary and fallopian tube, the involved distal ileum, and the liver metastasis were surgically removed. All deposits were histologically metastases from the original carcinoid tumour, although the distal ileal tumour metastasis only affected the serosal and muscular layers. Following an uneventful postoperative recovery, she commenced six cycles of chemotherapy with Streptozotocine and 5-fluorouracil.
In October 2004, she was admitted with abdominal cramps and vomiting. A CT scan revealed dilated intestinal loops that appeared to be attached to each other and with the anterior abdominal wall. In view of the previous surgery and the history of carcinomatosis, she underwent a further laparotomy. However, at operation, the cause was adhesional obstruction, although some foci were found in the parietal peritoneum and in the Pouch of Douglas. These implants were less than 4 mm in length and were excised. All the biopsies were positive for carcinoid tumour and after an uneventful recovery she was discharged. Further therapy with Somatostatin with the aim to control the progression of the disease and because she reported occasional flushing, achieved a good quality of life. At review in March of 2006, the patient reported some abdominal pain and infrequent flushing, but is otherwise well.

587,1635700-1,17090300,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1635700.xml,Emergency laparotomy for misdiagnosed biliary cystadenoma originating from caudate lobe,"A 30-years-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with upper abdominal pain. The patient had been well until the day before, when she began to have pain in the epigastrium. A few hours before admission the pain, which was now localized to the upper right abdominal quadrant, became constant and severe. Anorexia and nausea developed, followed by vomiting.
The patient had a previous history of hepatic hydatid disease. Two months earlier she underwent an abdominal ultrasound for abdominal pain during admission in another hospital. Following that exam, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which was diagnostic for hepatic hydatid cyst. For this reason the patient was on mebendazole for about 2 weeks until the last hospital admission. She took an oral contraceptive for about six months in the past and was not on any other medication.
The temperature was 39°C, pulse 96 and blood pressure was 100/70. The oxygen saturation was 98 % while the patient was breathing ambient air. On physical examination the patient appeared in severe pain. Lungs and heart sounds were normal. The abdomen was distended, and bowel sounds were absent. There was tenderness in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium, with guarding and rebound tenderness. No abnormalities were found on rectal examination.
The hematocrit was 30%, hemoglobin 10 g/dl, red blood cells 3.3 × 103 mm3, white cell count 13.7 × 103 mm3, and neutrophils were 84.4 %. The remaining lab tests and urine were normal. Since it was an emergent setting, no further attempts were made to confirm echinococcus infestation. Abdominal ultrasound and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a 9 × 11.8 × 10 cm cyst localized in the IV, VII and VIII hepatic segments, with multiple smaller cysts inside (Figure ). The cyst was located just posterior to the portal branch for the VII and VIII segments (Figure ). It compressed the inferior vena cava and the right and medial hepatic vein. The wall of the cyst was detached from the hepatic parenchyma as for hemorrhagic leak. Posteriorly to the hepatic peduncle, the wall of the cyst emerged at liver surface, just underneath the Glisson's capsule. Also, the adipose tissue between the liver on one side and the right adrenal gland and right kidney on the other showed signs of haemorrhage.
The patient was brought to the operating room in an emergent setting. Bilateral subcostal incision was performed. At the opening of the peritoneal cavity a small amount of clear fluid was found. Intra-operative liver ultrasound was employed. A voluminous hepatic cyst was found, which emerged to the liver surface at the level of caudate lobe and was extended up to the VIII segment. The cyst was evacuated of its content which was a brown-colored mucinous fluid. The intracystic fluid was sent for bacterial culture and evaluation for parasitic infestation. Hypertonic saline solution (33%) was injected into the cyst as a precaution in case of parasitic infestation. Partial pericystectomy was performed at the level of the caudate lobe. Ultrasound confirmed the complete evacuation of the cyst. Cholecystectomy was carried out due to the presence of biliary sludge. A biliary cystadenoma was confirmed at histologic evaluation. Sections 3 μm thick were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sections were immunostained with primary antibodies directed against vimentin (1:100 dilution; Dako), muscle-specific actin (1:100 dilution; Dako, clone HHF35), and desmin (1:100 dilution; Dako, clone D33). Immunodetection was performed using Universal Dako Cytomation LSAB + KIT, Peroxidase. Section analysis revealed multiple communicating locules of different size. The locules were lined by columnar, cuboidal or even flattened epithelium (Figure ). This was surrounded by a layer of highly cellular, mesenchymal tissue resembling ovarian stroma. The stromal cells were diffusely positive for vimentin and muscle specific actin, and focally positive for desmin. Cystic fluid analysis showed elevated levels of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19.9 (126387.10 UI/ml) while serum CA 19.9, carcinoembryogenic antigen (CEA) and α-fetoprotein were within the normal range. Cultures returned negative.
Post-operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on post-operative day 8. After complete recovery, the patient was admitted again to our Unit for definitive treatment. Before undergoing re-operation, the patient was re-evaluated with a new abdominal CT scan which showed the partial collapse of the cyst. Patient was brought to the operating room, where she underwent caudate lobectomy and posterior segmentectomy, including segmentectomy of segments VI and VII, and atypical segmentectomy of segment IV. Intra-operative ultrasound was used to evaluate the relationship of the cyst with adjacent structures. Since a communication between the cystadenoma and the biliary tree was found, a cholangiogram followed by a single suture closure of the biliary communication was performed.

588,1636035-1,17150118,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1636035.xml,Case report: intra-tendinous ganglion of the anterior cruciate ligament in a young footballer,"A 20-year-old male medical student presented with a 12-month history of right knee pain of insidious onset. He had been a regular amateur rugby union player for 12 years. No episodes of trauma and no previous knee problems were reported. The problem began as stiffness and pain and had worsened in the last 3 months to the extent that he had to stop playing. The patient described the pain as an intermittent deep ache. The pain was exacerbated by end of range flexion and extension.
Physical examination revealed right-sided posterior knee pain exacerbated by end range flexion and extension and mild effusion. Active range of movement was -15°–95° and passive range of movement -10°–100° (Fig and ). Atrophy of the right quadriceps was present. There was no joint-line tenderness on palpation. Anterior and posterior drawer and Lachmann tests were negative whilst compression rotation test was positive.
Physiotherapy was initially undertaken in order to improve range of movement. At review no improvement at all was seen and compression rotation test was still positive. MRI scans showed an abnormal anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Its fibres were intact but displaced by material containing high signal on the fat sat sequence, reported as appearing mucoid in nature. There were also areas of focally high signal in relation to its tibial attachment. These areas had the appearance of tiny ganglia. The report presumed that these ganglia extended into and thickened the ACL. The findings were in keeping with mucinous degeneration. There was evidence of intra-osseous cyst formation as shown by high signal at the attachment sites of the ligament (Fig. – arrows). X-ray was unremarkable. Based on these findings an arthroscopy with biopsies was undertaken.
Arthroscopy revealed several small ganglia in the ACL around the tibial insertion. Both menisci were intact and cartilage was normal. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was normal. The histology report from biopsies described ligament with multilocular foci of mucoid degeneration. There was no evidence of neoplasia.
As much as possible of the macroscopically abnormal tissue was excised arthroscopically (Fig , , ). Examination under anaesthesia showed a range of movement of -15°–110° pre-operatively and -5 – 140 degrees post surgery.
Lachmann's test and anterior drawer tests were negative after extensive debridement. Post-operatively the range of movement was improved to 5°–140+° (Fig , , , ). Following surgery the patient was referred for early mobilisation and physiotherapy. At 6 week follow up range of movement was increased to full passive flexion and full passive extension.
The patient remained pain free and returned to rugby 14 weeks after operation. No major trauma occurred during this time. However, instability was described following several games and positive anterior drawer and Lachmann's tests were present on examination. Arthroscopy confirmed the presence of an ACL tear (Fig ) and also showed cartilage and meniscal damage. The patient later had a patellar tendon graft performed.","[[20.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['right knee', 'knee', 'right-sided posterior knee', 'right quadriceps', 'joint-line', 'anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)', 'fibres', 'tibial attachment', 'ACL', 'intra-osseous', 'attachment sites of the ligament', 'ACL around the tibial insertion', 'Both menisci', 'cartilage', 'posterior cruciate ligament', 'PCL', 'ligament', 'mucoid', 'abnormal tissue', 'anterior drawer', 'ACL', 'cartilage', 'meniscal', 'patellar tendon']","['right knee pain', 'trauma', 'knee problems', 'stiffness', 'pain', 'pain', 'pain', 'right-sided posterior knee pain', 'effusion', 'Active range of movement', 'passive range of movement', 'Atrophy of the right quadriceps', 'joint-line tenderness on palpation', 'improve range of movement', 'improvement', 'abnormal anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)', 'fibres were intact', 'areas of focally high signal', 'ganglia', 'ganglia', 'mucinous degeneration', 'intra-osseous cyst formation', 'high signal', 'ganglia', 'Both menisci were intact', 'cartilage was normal', 'mucoid degeneration', 'neoplasia', 'macroscopically abnormal tissue', 'range of movement was improved', 'range of movement', 'pain', 'major trauma', 'instability', 'ACL tear', 'damage']",[],"['20', 'medical student', '12', 'amateur rugby union player']","['Physical examination', 'drawer and Lachmann tests', 'Lachmann tests', 'compression rotation test', 'Physiotherapy', 'compression rotation test', 'MRI', 'MRI scans', 'X-ray', 'arthroscopy', 'biopsies', 'Arthroscopy', 'histology', 'biopsies', 'As much as possible of the macroscopically abnormal tissue was excised arthroscopically', 'Examination', 'range of movement', 'surgery', ""Lachmann's test"", 'anterior drawer tests', 'extensive debridement', 'surgery', 'physiotherapy', ""anterior drawer and Lachmann's tests"", ""Lachmann's"", 'examination', 'Arthroscopy', 'patellar tendon graft']","['12-month', 'last 3 months', 'last 3 months', 'pre-operatively', 'post', 'Post-operatively', '6 week']"

He was complicated with phrenic nerve palsy, and a surgical treatment (reefing of the diaphragm) for this lesion had been undertaken at two months of age in another institute. At the first examination in our institute (at 5 months of age), active shoulder abduction and elbow flexion were absent (Fig. ). Mental and other motor functional developments were normal. During 3 months of observation, no spontaneous recovery of elbow flexion or shoulder abduction was shown. On electrophysiological evaluations, no action potential of the neuromuscular unit was revealed in the biceps and deltoid muscles. The action potential of the neuromuscular unit of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle showed a normal wave. Physical and electrical examinations revealed an upper trunk type (C5-C6) right-side plexopathy. We considered the possibility of spontaneous recovery for several months, but functional recovery was poor. An Oberlin's nerve transfer and an accessory to suprascapular nerve transfer were selected to facilitate a rapid motor functional recovery of the biceps and deltoid muscles.
Under general anesthesia, an operation was performed in the supine position. The brachial artery and the median, ulnar, and a branch of the musculocutaneous nerve supplying the biceps muscle were identified at a level approximately 7.0 cm distal from the acromion. One fascicle of the ulnar nerve was separated at the same level as the branch of the biceps muscle. We confirmed a fascicle corresponding to the motor fascicle of the ulnar nerve by microelectronic stimulation, and we then transferred this fascicle to the motor branch of the biceps muscle [,]. End-to-end nerve repair, at a level approximately 1.0 cm proximal from the insertion to the biceps muscle, was then performed using 10-0 sutures (Fig. ). After resection of the omohyoid muscle, the upper trunks appeared. The spinal accessory nerve and the suprascapular nerve were identified, and the spinal accessory nerve was then transferred to the suprascapular nerve. The duration of these procedures was two hours and forty minutes. After surgery, the upper arm of the operative site was set free with no cast immobilization. No specific motor re-education program was used post-operatively.
A primary contraction of the biceps muscle appeared two months after nerve transfer (British Medical Research Council grading (MRC): M1). Full ranged elbow flexion (MRC: M4), and 90 degree shoulder abduction (MRC: M3), were obtained five months after surgery. Forty months after surgery, the ranges of both elbow flexion, M5, and shoulder abduction, M4, were full.. However, these muscles were somewhat weak compared with the contralateral site.

The patient's profile was mild convex. Vertical facial proportions were normal, and there were no significant asymmetries (Figure ).
A full complement of permanent teeth was present except left lower first molar. There was a huge caries in the lower right first molar. Upper left second premolar was impacted. In centric occlusion canine relationships were Class I, and the incisors were in teeth a teeth relation. Both the maxillary and the mandibular arches exhibited moderate teeth disorderliness. Oral hygiene was moderate (Figures , and ).
In pretreatment cephalometric evaluation (Figure , Table ); the maxilla was normal to the cranial base (SNA 86°), and in centric occlusion the mandible was normal position to the cranial base (SNB 84°). The ANB (2°) indicated a Class I skeletal relationship. The maxillary incisors were slightly upright, while the mandibular incisors were somewhat protrusive. The mandibular plane was normal relative to cranial base (SN-MP 31°).
1. to establish Class I molar relationship.
2. to eliminate maxillary and mandibular arch disorders.
3. to erupt upper left second premolar because of the patient's rejection of surgically extraction of the impacted premolar.
4. to correct overbite, and overjet.
5. to align arches including midlines.
6. to constitute a good smile aesthetic.
The criteria for unilateral intraoral molar distalization were included;
• Skeletal Class I, unilateral Class II molar and canine relationship;
• Minimal or no crowding in the mandibular arch;
• Existence of bilateral 1st or 2nd premolar teeth;
• Rejection of surgically extraction of the impacted premolar;
• Rejection of headgear wear;
• Good oral hygiene.
The intraosseous screw (IMF Stryker, Leibinger, Germany) is a pure titanium one-piece device with an endosseous body and intraoral neck section. In this study, 1.8 mm diameter and 14-mm length screws were used.
The intraosseous screw was placed behind the incisive canal at a safe distance from the midpalatal suture following the palatal anatomy. To facilitate this application under local anesthesia, a syringe was placed in the incisive canal for reference, and a 1.5-mm-diameter hole was drilled five mm behind the syringe and three mm to the right or left of the raphe. The procedure took 5–8 minutes and a mucoperiostal opening flap was not needed [] (Figure ).
After healing, an impression was obtained with the screw in place, and a plaster model was prepared.
Upper right and left first premolar and first molar bands that had 0.018-inch brackets and 0.030-inch tubes were fitted to the teeth on the dental cast. A 0.036-inch (0.9 mm) stainless steel transpalatal arch (TPA) was prepared between the first premolars, with a ""U"" bend touching the screw. The TPA was soldered to the bands, the bands were cemented onto the premolars, and the U bend was bonded to the intraoral neck section of the screw using light-cured composite resin [], then bilateral sectional arches (0.016 × 0.022-inch stainless steel) and 0.036-inch nickel-titanium open-coil springs were inserted between upper left first premolar and first molar with a continuous force of 250 g and at the right side passively (Figure ).
The patient was seen every 4 weeks, and the force level of the coil spring was checked and activated when necessary. When upper left first molar was moved into an overcorrected Class I relationship by approximately 2 mm, the distalization was ended (Figures , , ).
A simple radio opaque cap was applied to the left first molar when taking cephalogram to differentiating the left from the right on ceph.
After distalization, the following treatment was established:
Maxillary and mandibular fixed appliances (.018 × .025 inch slot) were used. After initial leveling and alignment with round arch wires in upper and lower dental arch, a .016 × .022 inch ss utility arch was used for protrusion of the upper incisors. For retrusion of the mandibular incisors .016 × .022 inch continue arch with lingual root torque in incisor region and Class III elastics were used. Fixed appliance treatment was completed in 14 months.","[[13.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['skeletal', 'profile', 'Vertical facial', 'teeth', 'left lower first molar', 'lower right first molar', 'Upper left second premolar', 'canine', 'teeth', 'maxillary', 'mandibular arches', 'teeth', 'Oral', 'maxilla', 'cranial base', 'mandible', 'cranial base', 'skeletal', 'maxillary incisors', 'mandibular incisors', 'mandibular plane', 'cranial base', 'molar', 'maxillary', 'mandibular arch', 'upper left second premolar', 'premolar', 'arches', 'unilateral intraoral molar', 'Skeletal', 'molar', 'canine', 'mandibular arch', 'bilateral 1st or 2nd premolar teeth', 'premolar', 'oral', 'intraosseous', 'endosseous body', 'intraoral neck section', 'incisive canal', 'midpalatal suture', 'palatal anatomy', 'incisive canal', 'five mm behind the syringe', 'three mm to the right or left of the raphe', 'mucoperiostal', 'first premolar', 'first molar', 'teeth', 'first premolars', 'premolars', 'intraoral neck section of the screw', 'bilateral sectional arches', 'upper left first premolar', 'first molar', 'upper left first molar', 'left first molar', 'upper and lower dental arch', 'mandibular incisors', 'lingual root', 'incisor region']","['skeletal Class I relationship', 'convex', 'Vertical facial proportions were normal', 'asymmetries', 'full complement of permanent teeth', 'caries', 'Upper left second premolar was impacted', 'centric occlusion canine relationships', 'incisors were in teeth a teeth relation', 'teeth disorderliness', 'Oral hygiene was moderate', 'maxilla was normal to the cranial base', 'centric occlusion', 'mandible was normal position to the cranial base', 'skeletal relationship', 'upright', 'protrusive', 'mandibular plane was normal relative to cranial base', 'disorders', 'erupt upper left second premolar', 'impacted premolar', 'correct overbite, and overjet', 'align arches including midlines', 'good smile aesthetic', 'unilateral intraoral molar distalization', 'relationship', 'crowding', 'Existence of bilateral 1st or 2nd premolar teeth', 'impacted premolar', 'Rejection of headgear wear', 'Good oral hygiene', 'healing', 'screw in place', 'moved into an overcorrected Class I relationship', 'distalization was ended']",[],['13'],"['cephalometric evaluation', 'SNA', 'SNB', 'ANB', 'SN-MP', 'surgically extraction of the impacted premolar', 'surgically extraction of the impacted premolar', 'headgear wear', 'intraosseous screw (IMF Stryker, Leibinger, Germany) is a pure titanium one-piece device with an endosseous body and intraoral neck section', 'intraosseous screw was placed', 'intraosseous screw was placed behind the incisive canal at a safe distance from the midpalatal suture following the palatal anatomy', 'local anesthesia', 'syringe was placed in the incisive canal', '1.5-mm-diameter hole was drilled five mm behind the syringe and three mm to the right or left of the raphe', 'procedure', 'mucoperiostal opening flap', 'Upper right and left first premolar and first molar bands that had 0.018-inch brackets and 0.030-inch tubes were fitted to the teeth on the dental cast', 'A 0.036-inch (0.9 mm) stainless steel transpalatal arch (TPA) was prepared between the first premolars, with a ""U"" bend touching the screw', 'TPA was soldered to the bands', 'bands were cemented onto the premolars', 'U bend was bonded to the intraoral neck section of the screw using light-cured composite resin', 'simple radio opaque cap was applied to the left first molar', 'cephalogram', 'ceph', 'distalization', 'treatment', 'initial leveling and alignment with round arch wires in upper and lower dental arch', 'retrusion of the mandibular incisors', 'Fixed appliance treatment']",[]

There was no history of trauma, seizures or loss of consciousness. Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain (Figure ) showed a 3.5 cm sized ring-enhancing mass in the right parietal lobe with significant perilesional oedema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed the mass to be isointense on T1 and hypointense on T2 weighted images. The patient underwent right parietal craniotomy with gross total excision of the tumour. Histopathology of the operative specimen showed features of undifferentiated sarcoma with areas of necrosis (Figure ). The pathological differential diagnoses given were metastatic sarcoma and primary intracranial sarcoma. Radiographic skeletal survey, chest x-ray and ultrasonogram of the abdomen were normal at this time. The patient was treated with postoperative cranial radiotherapy to a dose of 60 Gray with concomitant chemotherapy with carboplatin at a dose of 150 mg weekly.
The patient remained asymptomatic till June 2004 when he complained of abdominal fullness and pain. CT of the abdomen showed a large mesenteric mass measuring 8 × 6 cm in size. An ultrasound guided tru-cut biopsy from the mesenteric mass revealed a malignant spindle cell tumour with morphology similar to that of the brain tumour. The mitotic index of the abdominal tumour was 10 per 50 HPF (high power fields). Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD34, vimentin; and negative for GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and SMA (smooth muscle actin). Thereafter the patient was treated with six cycles of combination chemotherapy with ifosfamide 1.8 gm/m2 i.v.

However, there was no apparent clinical response to chemotherapy, and abdomen CT (Figure ) done at this time showed a 10 × 8 cm sized heterogeneously enhancing mesenteric mass.
Given the failed response to chemotherapy, the pathology specimen was retested for CD117/c-kit which turned out to be positive. Thus, the patient was diagnosed as a primary mesenteric gastrointestinal stromal tumour presenting as solitary brain metastasis. The patient was then treated with imatinib mesylate 600 mg oral daily. CT scan of the chest and abdomen after three months of therapy showed a good response, evidenced by a cystic conversion of tumour mass with no visible areas of enhancement (Figure ). The patient continued to remain on imatinib therapy. However, after the initial response, CT scan of abdomen done after another three months showed a focal nodular area of enhancement (arrow) within the mesenteric mass, suggestive of disease progression. (Figure ) The patient subsequently developed cachexia and died four months later.","[[42.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['brain', 'right parietal lobe', 'head', 'right parietal', 'intracranial', 'skeletal', 'chest', 'abdomen', 'cranial', 'abdominal', 'abdomen', 'mesenteric', 'mesenteric', 'spindle cell', 'brain', 'abdominal', 'abdomen', 'mesenteric', 'mesenteric gastrointestinal stromal', 'brain', 'chest', 'abdomen', 'abdomen', 'nodular area', 'mesenteric']","['headache', 'left-sided weakness', 'vomiting', 'trauma', 'seizures', 'loss of consciousness', 'ring-enhancing mass', 'perilesional oedema', 'mass', 'tumour', 'sarcoma', 'necrosis', 'metastatic sarcoma', 'primary intracranial sarcoma', 'intracranial sarcoma', 'asymptomatic', 'fullness', 'pain', 'mesenteric mass', 'mesenteric mass', 'malignant spindle cell tumour', 'brain tumour', 'abdominal tumour', 'apparent clinical response to chemotherapy', 'enhancing mesenteric mass', 'mesenteric mass', 'mesenteric gastrointestinal stromal tumour', 'solitary brain metastasis', 'good response', 'cystic conversion of tumour mass', 'visible areas of enhancement', 'focal nodular area of enhancement', 'mesenteric mass', 'disease progression', 'cachexia', 'died']","['carboplatin', 'ifosfamide', 'epirubicin', 'imatinib mesylate', 'imatinib']","['42', 'January 2004', 'June 2004', 'November 2004']","['Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head', 'right parietal craniotomy', 'gross total excision of the tumour', 'Histopathology', 'Radiographic skeletal survey', 'chest x-ray', 'ultrasonogram of the abdomen', 'cranial radiotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'CT of the abdomen', 'ultrasound guided tru-cut biopsy', 'mitotic index of the abdominal tumour', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'CD34', 'vimentin', 'GFAP', 'glial fibrillary acidic protein', 'SMA', 'smooth muscle actin', 'combination chemotherapy', 'mesna uroprotection', 'chemotherapy', 'abdomen CT', 'chemotherapy', 'pathology specimen', 'CD117', 'c-kit', 'CT scan', 'CT scan of the chest and abdomen', 'therapy', 'CT scan of abdomen']","['January 2004', 'January 2004', 'eight months', 'eight months', 'four months', 'at this time', 'at this time', 'at this time', 'postoperative', 'till June 2004', 'June 2004', 'November 2004', 'at this time', 'after another three months', 'four months', 'four months later']"

Medical history revealed a high-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the stomach in 1996. The lymphoma was staged as IE according to the Ann Arbor staging system, and showed complete response after chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy (60 Gy) of the local nodal regions. On physical examination, a large mass was palpated in the epigastrium that filled the entire right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Routine laboratory investigations, including blood glucose levels, and serum levels of tumour markers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], and carbohydrate antigen [Ca19-9]) were within normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen demonstrated a large, heterogeneous mass in the left hepatic lobe, measuring 24 cm in largest diameter, with necrosis and calcification (Figure ). There were no signs of recurrence of high grade MALT lymphoma. Liver biopsy showed spindle-cell elements with cellular atypia suggesting a sarcoma. Laparotomy was performed and revealed a large tumour, which only involved segment IV of the liver, and a left lobectomy was performed. Postoperative course was uneventful. After 12 months of follow-up the patient had no signs of local recurrence or distant metastases.
Gross examination showed a large tumour measuring 24 × 21 × 15 cm that weighed 2950 g (Figure ). Macroscopically, the tumour was located in the liver parenchyma and not in relation to serosal surface. The lesion was well encapsulated, and contained a number of central necrotic and scarred areas with radiating bands of fibrous tissue. Microscopically, the tumour was composed of neoplastic spindle cells, with uniform, elongated nuclei, separated by abundant thick bands of collagen (Figure , and ). A few highly cellular areas with high mitotic rate of 10 – 13 mitosis/10 HPF were detected. In the higher cellular areas, cells were close together with limited amounts of collagen (Figure ). The organization of the tumour cells was different in several areas, varying from small bundles of spindle cells arranged haphazardly, arranged in some groups with nuclear pallisading or in a storiform pattern. Cells were separated by an abundant reticulin network, which appeared in a random pattern. An abundant thin walled vascular network was present with some heamangiopericyoma-like vascular spaces (Figure ). Immunohistochemistry revealed strong expression of CD34, CD99, BCL2 and vimentin in virtually all tumour cells (Figure , and ). No immunoreactivity was shown with pankeratin, keratin 8/18, epithelial membrane antigen, smooth-muscle actin, desmin, S100, Factor VIII, CD 31 and CD117.

The patient was placed under general anesthesia and underwent septoplasty and bilateral concha bullosa resection via lateral laminectomies. Histopathologic evaluation of the concha bullosa material from both the left and right sides revealed chronic inflammation and noncaseating granulomas.

He developed severe pain at the site of the bites and was managed at local hospital. A day later he developed oliguria and by next day became anuric and developed nausea and vomiting, following which he was referred to our hospital. At admission, on examination, he was conscious and had mild pallor. The systemic examination was normal. Twenty-seven sting marks were found on face, shoulders and upper limbs.
Investigations revealed hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dl platelet count of 529,000/mm3; TLC of 16200/mm3 with peripheral blood film revealing microcytes, micro-ovalocytes, macrocytes with hypochromia. Blood biochemistry revealed urea 310 mg/dl, S. creatinine of 9.2 mg/dl. Serum CPK and transaminases (AST & ALT) were within normal limits. He had normal urinalysis. There was no evidence of intravascular hemolysis as urine was negative for hemoglobin and plasma hemoglobin was less than 20 mg/dl. Ultrasound of abdomen revealed normal sized kidneys.
His renal failure was managed by hemodialysis. However despite repeated hemodialysis, his urea and creatinine remained persistently high so kidney biopsy was undertaken after two weeks. It revealed 12 normal glomeruli, focal interstitial infiltration with eosinophils and lymphocytes with hyaline and pigmented granular casts in the tubules (fig ).

There was no record of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, tobacco use or previously known coronary artery disease. Importantly, he was not taking any cardiovascular medication, including ASA.
The patient first presented to the emergency department of a referral hospital complaining of lower chest pain and vomiting. The ECG showed no signs of acute ischemia and, as biomarkers of myocardial necrosis tested negative, the patient was discharged with no further evaluation. During the next days, chest pain persisted and, on day five after the initial symptoms, he went back to the emergency. At that time the ECG showed inferior pathological Q waves, slight (~1 mm) ST-segment elevation and biphasic T waves on the inferior leads and a test for cardiac troponin I was positive. The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of subacute inferior myocardial infarction with recurrent angina and anti-thrombotic and anti-ischemic medications (including low molecular weight heparin and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors) were started. Due to the persistence of chest pain the patient was referred for urgent coronary catheterization, which was performed at our institution on day five after symptom onset. Angiography showed a critical stenosis of the right coronary artery with TIMI 2 grade flow, with no other significant coronary lesions. An angioplasty procedure with deployment of a drug-eluting stent was successfully undertaken and the patient transferred to the CCU for routine monitoring.
On day seven after the first chest pain episode, clinicians were surprised by a new and persistent 4 to 5 mm ST-segment elevation affecting leads V1 to V5, I and aVL (Figure ). The patient's clinical status remained remarkably stable as he experienced no recurrent chest pain, heart sounds could be eared clearly, there were no murmurs or bruits and blood pressure was in a somewhat expected range (~120/80 mmHg), considering that pressure lowering drugs had been newly introduced in incremental dosage. Serial evaluation of biomarkers of myocardial necrosis showed no increase relative to earlier post-PCI values, but white cell counts and CRP levels were both slightly elevated. At this point, a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, showing a global small-to-moderate echodense pericardial effusion, somewhat larger in the posterior and inferior aspects of the heart, with no signs of tamponade (Figure and ). There were no regional wall motion abnormalities of the anterior wall and, in addition to basal inferior-wall akinesis, a canalicular tract from endo to pericardium was seen along the interface between the necrotic and the normal contracting myocardium (Figure , , , ). Power-Doppler evaluation additionally suggested an abnormal blood leak across the inferior LV wall (Figure , ) and, on the basis of these findings, a LVFWR was suspected. While the transoesophageal echocardiogram with intravenous echocontrast brought no further input, cardiac MRI images (Figure ) corroborated the TTE findings and reinforced the diagnostic suspicion of LVFWR, leading to urgent surgery. After pericardiotomy and cloth evacuation there was a significant increase in the systemic blood pressure, suggesting that tamponade might have been impending. The myocardial tear was identified and successfully repaired with a tephlon band supported suture technique. Recovery was uneventful allowing hospital discharge 5 days after the operation. Two years after the event the patient is still alive and leading a normal life.
As previously mentioned, mechanical complications of acute MI, including LVFWR, apparently tend to become less frequent in day-to-day practice, at least in part due to the our growing ability to deliver safe and effective reperfusion therapies (both pharmacological and mechanical) to a wide range of MI patients.
The time frame for the occurrence of LVFWR may vary widely. In the pre-thrombolytic era incidence peaked between days 5 and 7 after the MI, but rupture has been reported to occur as late as one month or even beyond [-].
Traditionally, factors considered to increase the risk of LVFWR would include advanced age (6th decade or later), female gender, hypertension without left ventricular hypertrophy, delayed or no reperfusion, the anterior location of the AMI, no prior angina, a first myocardial infarction, poor collateral circulation to the infarct related area, use of NSAIDs or steroids during the acute phase, and high serum levels of C-reactive protein [,,].
Although cardiac rupture following AMI cannot be explained by any single factor, in this particular case, variables predicting the anticipated risk of cardiac rupture were related mainly to treatment delay and patient's age. Gender differences regarding the outcome after AMI have been well established, and even in the direct PCI (d-PCI) era, female sex has still been reported to be an independent predictor of LV rupture [,].
Despite being theoretically more probable in the inferior-lateral wall, it seems that the fact that anterior infarcts are more common, renders anterior wall ruptures more frequent []. However, a thorough literature review showed that, in the specific case of subacute LV wall rupture, inferior infarctions seem to be involved in the majority of the cases [-]. It has been stated that this might be due to the fact that patients with anterior wall ruptures may be less protected because blood tends to accumulate and to form adherent cloths in the posterior-inferior wall [].
Despite age and general clinical status would have made this patient eligible for on site reperfusion therapy, absence or delay of timely reperfusion (owing to late diagnosis) was perhaps the major risk factor for LVFWR. The reported decrease in the incidence of MI-related cardiac rupture in the thrombolytic and subsequently in the d-PCI era is relatively consistent. Regarding the absolute risk of mechanical complications, there is general agreement in that any reperfusion is better than no reperfusion. However, perhaps particularly in elderly patients, the relation between the use and the timing of thrombolytic treatment (which is the most widely used reperfusion strategy) and the risk of LV rupture, has been matter of concern [,]. This is due to the fact that up to 30% of MI patients arrive to the hospital later than the optimal time-frame for thrombolysis to be potentially beneficial []. Although still controversial, there is evidence to suggest that, contrary to data provided by previous reports and post-hoc analysis of pivotal clinical trials [,], neither thrombolysis itself nor the time delay to thrombolytic treatment actually seem to increase the absolute risk of LVFWR. In the LATE trial [], Becker et al. found no significant differences in the incidence of LVFWR in patients treated with a rt-PA based regimen within the 6 to 12 hour period after symptom onset and those randomized to the active treatment arm between 12 and 24 hours. However, there was a significant interaction between the assignment to active treatment and the time of rupture occurrence, as thrombolysis appeared to accelerate rupture events, typically to within 24 h after treatment []. Several possible mechanisms underlying this paradoxical effect of fibrinolysis have been proposed, such as extension of myocardial hemorrhage, weakening and dissection of the necrotizing zone [], diminishing of the myocardial collagen content [], and digestion of collagen by collagenases and plasmin [-]. Whether or not d-PCI would have similar effects has been recently examined in a retrospective analysis of a single centre registry of 1250 patients treated with d-PCI. In the 12 patients who had LV rupture (including free wall rupture and VSD), this complication occurred somewhat later than with thrombolysis, but earlier than that reported for non-reperfused patients []. The relative advantages of PCI versus lytics in this high risk group of patients have been evaluated in the SENIOR-PAMI trial []. In this yet unpublished study, 483 patients aged ≥ 70 years old were randomized to primary PCI or thrombolysis; despite a small difference favoring PCI, it failed to significantly reduce the 30-day mortality rate (10% vs 13%), thus suggesting that the incidence of fatal mechanical complications could have been quite similar. However, as the overall reduction in the incidence of the composite endpoint of death, MI or stroke favored PCI over thrombolysis (11.6 vs 18%; p = 0.05), this study might have been underpowered to evaluated the benefits of PCI in isolated hard endpoints such as MI-related death.
When the acute form of LVFWR occurs, it usually results in an abrupt haemodynamic collapse with cardiac tamponade and electromechanical dissociation. Death ensues in a matter of minutes to hours in the large majority of cases, as cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers are uniformly unsuccessful.
Less frequently, in up to one third of the cases, the rupture can be sealed by the epicardium or by a haematoma on the epicardial surface of the heart, forming a ""LV diverticulum"" or contained myocardial rupture. This situation represents a subacute pathologic condition standing somewhere between free rupture into the pericardial cavity and formation of a pseudoaneurysm [,-]. This much less spectacular scenario – gradual or ""oozing type"" rupture – may evolve over hours or even days, and presents mainly with pericardial effusion related signs and symptoms.
Myocardial free wall rupture should be suspected in patients with recent MI who have recurrent or persistent chest pain, sometimes of the pericardial type, haemodynamic instability, syncope (resulting from transient electromechanical dissociation), and pericardial tamponade. New ST segment changes (""saddle shaped ST-segment elevation"") may be the chief clinical manifestations [,]. In fact, electrocardiographic findings in LV rupture patients may be related to its type and severity. Electromechanical dissociation (with a diagnostic accuracy that reaches 97%) and bradycardia are features of the acute variety, while new ST-elevation in the affected leads or persistent non-inversion of T-waves may suggest the less noisy ""stuttering"" type of rupture [,]. In this setting, interventions that can dramatically change prognosis can be employed, as long as an accurate diagnosis can be timely established. Clinical course depends mainly on the rate of bleeding and the compliance of the pericardial sac. Signs of restricted ventricular filling may be absent if the effusion develops slowly enough and bleeding ultimately subsides [,,,].
In a scenario of relatively low threshold for clinical suspicion, the unexpected ECG changes were the key to the diagnosis. Otherwise, patient was only to be exposed to the natural history of the disease which, at this point, may be rather unpredictable [-]. In our institution, the risk stratification protocol after an acute MI includes an echocardiographic examination. However, unless a complicated clinical course ensues, it is performed only after the patient has stepped down to the ward. Thus, no additional investigations were to be made at that time.
In those who are haemodynamically unstable, which was not the case of our patient, right heart catheterization will usually provide useful information and may help in the differential diagnosis with other life threatening complications, such as VSD. In the typical patient, right atrial pressure will be comparable to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [].
Emergency pericardiocentesis has the potential for the identification of haemopericardium and relief of cardiac tamponade. Despite rarely seen in the acute MI setting, cardiac tamponade may be caused by serous or serohaemorrhagic pericardial effusions; also, the risk of chamber puncture and the theoretical possibility of ""thrombus displacement"" and ""decompression"" of the contained rupture, can, not only hamper the diagnostic accuracy of pericardiocentesis, but also make it potentially harmful. Given these considerations, we strongly feel that this procedure should not be ""routinely"" used as a diagnostic tool and should be kept for situations of absolute need for tamponade relief [].
If a mechanical complication is suspected, emergency bedside transthoracic and/or contrasted transesophageal echocardiograms are considered the gold standard diagnostic tools [].
Pericardial effusion is the most common finding, usually with echodense intrapericardial echoes. The absence of pericardial effusion in a patient with AMI excludes the diagnosis of myocardial rupture, but its presence as an isolated finding in this context does not definitively confirm the diagnosis. Right atrial and right ventricular wall compression as well as Doppler signs of a compromised ventricular filling, can also be identified by 2D echocardiography. Direct signs of rupture like a myocardial tear, as in this case, will be seen only occasionally [,]. In a prospective study involving 1247 MI patients (33 with subacute LV rupture), the presence of cardiac tamponade, pericardial effusion greater than 5 mm, high density intrapericardial echoes or right atrial or right ventricular wall compression had a high diagnostic sensitivity (≥ 70%) and specificity (≥ 90%). Despite data reporting on high positive predictive values of intrapericardial echoes and echocardiographic signs of tamponade alone, still the number of false-positive findings for every single variable may be relatively high (>20%) [,]. However, when combined with syncope, in the appropriate clinical setting, their diagnostic accuracy may reach 100% [].
In our case, Doppler examination suggested an abnormal intramyocardial tract, but could not definitely demonstrate active bleeding into the pericardium. The detection of blood flow at the site of rupture may not be feasible in many cases, as the myocardial tear is most often anfractuous and sometimes covered by thrombi and thus blood flow velocities may be low. Despite the potential ability of contrast echocardiography to decrease the number of false-positive diagnoses [-] – by showing leakage of contrast from the left ventricle into the pericardial effusion – it was of no help in our patient.
The role of new imaging techniques in this setting, such as cardiac MRI, although promising, remains observational and anecdotic [-]. Trials assessing the relative value of echocardiography and high resolution CT scans or cardiac MRI are limited not only by clinical, but also by obvious ethical and logistic issues. The wide availability of ultrasound makes this technique ""difficult to beat"" in the clinical ground, as the expensive technology and expertise needed for cardiac MDCT or MRI imaging are not promptly available in the majority of the hospitals, even in those where cardiac surgery is promptly available. Nevertheless, we should emphasize the high grade of concordance between echocardiographic and MRI images (Figure and Figure ). Although MRI had, in our case, a paramount importance in the establishment of the diagnosis and in the decision to proceed to surgical treatment, standard and/or contrast enhanced echocardiograms, in expert hands, will generally be trusted as the ultimate diagnostic tools.
Despite cases of a fairly good long term survival following a conservative approach have been described [,], there is general agreement in that surgery provides the only potentially definitive treatment option and that the diagnosis of subacute LVFWR usually requires a surgical decision []. However, the finding that patients presenting with LV pseudoaneurisms might have survived to subacute forms of LV rupture (with only mild hypotension or asymptomatic pericardial effusions) may argue against the absolute need for surgery, suggesting that a conservative management can be an acceptable choice in carefully selected patients, namely those at high surgical risk.
One prospective study reported a 44% survival rate among MI patients with confirmed or strongly suspected LVFWR who survived resuscitation maneuvers after electromechanical dissociation (EMD) or presented only with hypotension without EMD [] and were treated conservatively. However, in this study there wasn't a surgically treated group suitable for comparison and the possibility of other causes of cardiac tamponade could not be definitely ruled out. Medical management included pericardiocentesis as needed, prolonged bed rest and strict control of LV pressure (preferably with beta blockers) and avoidance of obstipation. Blinc et al., in a retrospective analysis, reported much poorer results with a survival rate of only 10% []. Intra-aortic balloon pumping has also been employed effectively in unstable patients unresponsive to inotropic agents and fluid replacement [] but some have found its use to be debatable, unless persistent ischemia and/or LV pump failure also ensues [,].
The very high surgical risk, which can be unacceptable if the procedure is to end up as ""blank"" sternotomy, is the major drawback posed to surgeons. Thus, all efforts should be made to confirm the diagnosis in order to reduce the number of false positives. The goals of surgery are to stop bleeding, to relieve cardiac tamponade and to prevent a second rupture. When possible, off-pump sutureless techniques using biocompatible glues and patches to cover the necrotic/ruptured area are increasingly being preferred to infarctectomy and direct myocardial suture, and are thought to yield better results [,,,]. However, some reports have suggested that inferior-lateral ruptures – as in the case of our patient – may be adequately treated with direct suture. Coronary artery bypass grafting is also indicated as needed. Emergency coronary angiography in order to determine which coronary arteries to bypass is warranted in the subacute setting, although the possibility of proceeding directly to surgery and perform empirically based bypassing of all of the major epicardial coronary arteries as also been described [].
Despite high perioperative mortality rates (33 to 55%), a rather well preserved post-procedure left ventricular function, as well as a fairly good functional long term prognosis are increasingly being reported [,-].","[[69.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['coronary artery', 'cardiovascular', 'lower chest', 'myocardial', 'chest', 'cardiac', 'inferior myocardial', 'chest', 'right coronary artery', 'coronary',

A 59 year old male patient (86 kg; 1,75 m) collapsed at home following intensive coughing. The medical history includes hypertension being treated with a beta-blocker, house-dust-allergy, chronic bronchitis related cough, and two operations on a spinal disc prolaps. The patient is known to have smoked (15 pack years).
There was no previous history of trauma.
On admission to hospital examination revealed a 10 cm well demarcated area of haemorrhage in the right side of the epigastrium. The abdomen was painful, but soft with no palpable mass or herniation. An abdominal computed tomography showed a fracture of the ninth right rib with a surrounding haematoma and hematothorax; however, no bowel herniation or muscle tear was evident (Fig. , ). A thoracic drain was inserted for two days. During the hospital stay the patient's abdomen became meteoristic and painful. He had no bowel movements for five days. A CT scan confirmed an intestinal obstruction, showing an ileus due to a massive herniation on the right lateral side of the abdomen (Fig. , ). An operation followed in which a crosswise incision along the ninth rib was made. The herniation was reduced without bowel resection. During the operation a rupture of the diaphragm also was found. The diaphragm and the internal and oblique abdominal muscle were adapted and the abdomen was reinforced with a prolene net.
Post operation the patient remained intubated for six days to prevent coughing.
At the time of discharge the patient was well. A clinical and radiographic investigation six months later showed no renewed herniation, and the patient remained well.","[[59.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['ninth rib', 'diaphragm', 'abdominal', 'spinal disc', 'right side of the epigastrium', 'abdomen', 'abdominal', 'ninth right rib', 'bowel', 'muscle', 'thoracic', 'abdomen', 'bowel', 'intestinal', 'right lateral side of the abdomen', 'ninth rib', 'bowel', 'diaphragm', 'diaphragm', 'internal and oblique abdominal muscle', 'abdominal muscle', 'abdomen']","['cough', 'stress fracture of the ninth rib', 'traumatic rupture of the diaphragm', 'abdominal herniation', 'cough', 'collapsed', 'coughing', 'hypertension', 'bronchitis', 'cough', 'spinal disc prolaps', 'trauma', 'haemorrhage', 'painful', 'mass', 'herniation', 'fracture of the ninth right rib', 'surrounding haematoma', 'hematothorax', 'bowel herniation', 'muscle tear', 'meteoristic', 'painful', 'bowel movements', 'intestinal obstruction', 'ileus', 'herniation', 'herniation', 'rupture of the diaphragm', 'coughing', 'well', 'herniation', 'remained well']",[],['59'],"['beta-blocker', 'operations on a spinal disc prolaps', 'abdominal computed tomography', 'thoracic drain was inserted', 'CT scan', 'crosswise incision along the ninth rib', 'herniation was reduced', 'bowel resection', 'operation', 'abdomen was reinforced with a prolene net', 'intubated', 'radiographic']","['two days', 'five days', 'Post operation', 'At the time of discharge', 'six months later']"

He had a history of extended right hepatectomy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma (stage 2) 20 months earlier. On arrival, his blood pressure and pulse rate were 99/54 mm Hg and 101/min, respectively. Initial laboratory studies showed his hematocrit and hemoglobin were 25.8% and 8.2 g/dL. Nasogastric tube lavage revealed a material that looked like coffee grounds. Emergent gastrointestinal endoscopic examination was performed immediately and disclosed a giant peptic ulcer with active bleeding at the posterior wall of the duodenal bulbs (Figure ). Angiography was performed for the bleeding duodenal ulcer, which was not controlled by endoscopic hemostasis. Extravasation of contrast medium was not noted at the artery around the duodenum; however, transarterial embolization (TAE) was accomplished for the duodenal branch of the gastroduodenal artery. Massive hematemesis and anal bleeding occurred on the sixth day after the first TAE. The bleeding point of the ulcer was endoscopically treated with a clip (Figure ). Nevertheless, because bleeding from the duodenal ulcer occurred repeatedly, endoscopic treatment and TAE was performed, and endoscopic hemostasis was performed on the 10th, 14th, and 17th day, and TAE was performed on the 10th, 14th, 19th day. Finally, we embolized the common hepatic artery, the bilateral subphrenic artery, and the jejunal branch for hepaticojejunostomy.

The patient remained in coma for 12 days with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3–6. Gradual improvement was noticed and the patient started showing signs of alertness and increasing muscle tone of the upper and lower limbs, however they were still in spasm (flexion of upper limbs and extension of lowers). CT scans revealed diffuse low attenuation change in the supratentorial compartment, loss of grey-white matter differentiation and loss of sulcus pattern due to cerebral swelling; a diagnosis of global ischemic/hypoxic brain injury was then reached.
After one month, the patient responsiveness to touch and voice increased, he responded to eye contact and answered questions by yes/no and his GCS reached 15. However, he continued to suffer muscle spasm, have no control over his bladder or bowels and had difficulty in speaking as well as feeding problems; he is currently under multidisciplinary care.
The patient was then referred to the Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS), UCLH suffering from trismus and bruxism. Clinical examination revealed a mouth opening of 0 mm; the patient was fed by a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) tube as oral feeding was impossible. Botulinum toxin was then suggested as a possible treatment for his problem.
The treatment (injections) was carried out in the following visit. Botulinum toxin-A (Botox; Allergan Inc, Irvine, CA) was injected into the right and left masseter and temporalis muscles. One hundred units were reconstituted with 2.5 mL of sterile preservative-free saline and drawn up into an insulin syringe. The skin was cleansed with an alcohol wipe, and the masseter muscle was palpated at its insertion at the angle and body of the mandible. Two injections of 4 Units (2 × 4 U) were given 1 cm superior to the inferior border of the mandible and two other injections of 4 Units (2 × 4 U) were given 1 cm inferior to the inferior border of the zygomatic arch. A fifth injection (1 × 4 U) was given in the centre of the masseter muscle. Three more injections of 4 Units (3 × 4 U) were given 1 cm inferior to the origin of the temporalis muscle. The process was repeated on the contralateral side. (Figure )
Three weeks later, the patient was reviewed and had shown a great improvement in his trismus with a mouth opening of 15 mm, with no bruxism reported. There was no erythema, swelling, or any clinical abnormality at the injection sites.
Botox was injected again in the masseter and temporalis muscles 2 weeks later. One week after the second treatment, the patient showed signs of good recovery from trismus and the mouth opening was 20 mm.

In 1992, the patient presented with pain in the OS and an uneventful enucleation was performed (Figure ). Histopathologic examination disclosed a monotonous and diffuse proliferation of small lymphocytes in the uveal tract with extra ocular extension. Immunohistochemical study was strongly positive for CD20 (B lymphocytes) and negative for CD45RO (T lymphocytes), consistent with a well-differentiated B-cell lymphoma (Figure ). No signs of systemic involvement were detected. The patient was lost to follow-up six years after surgery.
Severe pain may develop in blind eyes for various reasons including surgical and non-surgical trauma, and retinal detachment. Management of a blind painful eye represents a challenge for the ophthalmologist and is limited to topical medications, retrobulbar alcohol injection, evisceration or enucleation.[]
Relief of ocular pain is the most common reason that enucleation is performed in BPE.[] In the past, ocular melanomas arising in a BPE could account for more than 10% of all diagnosed uveal melanomas.[] Volcker and Naumann[] in 1976 described 36 cases of unsuspected ocular melanoma that were diagnosed after enucleation. The clinical diagnoses in those cases were secondary glaucoma (30), retinal detachment (2), iritis (2), and end/panophthalmitis (2). Review of the literature today shows that the clinical suspicion rate of an intraocular malignancy in BPE is not well established. Previous studies of enucleated globes do not correlate blindness with unsuspected intraocular tumors.[]
In this particular report, the unsuspected melanoma was present in a blind painful eye of a mentally handicapped patient. Intraocular lymphomas of the uveal tract have been discovered in functional eyes with symptoms of retinal detachment and increased intraocular pressure.
Intraocular tumors arising in blind painful eyes are probably under diagnosed and underreported. Several uveal melanomas, [,,] two adenocarcinomas of the retinal pigment epithelium [,] and an unspecified sarcoma [] have been described (Table ). In two of those cases, enucleation was performed to relieve the pain and an early stage malignant tumor was found,[,] leading to a good prognosis. However, in cases with advanced disease and extra-ocular involvement, an enucleation was performed due to a high index of suspicion of an intraocular malignancy.[-] In those cases the prognosis was poor.
Several authors emphasized the importance of ultrasonographic studies to diagnose intraocular tumors in blind painful eyes.[,]","[[54.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['retinal', 'OS', 'uveal tract', 'extra ocular', 'eyes', 'retinal', 'eye', 'retrobulbar', 'ocular', 'ocular', 'uveal', 'ocular', 'retinal', 'intraocular', 'intraocular', 'eye', 'Intraocular', 'uveal tract', 'eyes', 'retinal', 'intraocular', 'Intraocular', 'eyes', 'uveal', 'retinal pigment epithelium', 'extra-ocular', 'intraocular', 'intraocular', 'eyes']","[""Steinert's syndrome"", 'blind', 'atrophic OS', 'systemic hypertension', 'rhegmatogenous retinal detachment', 'retinal detachment', 'pain', 'proliferation of small lymphocytes', 'extra ocular extension', 'B-cell lymphoma', 'systemic involvement', 'pain', 'blind eyes', 'surgical and non-surgical trauma', 'retinal detachment', 'blind painful eye', 'Relief of ocular pain', 'ocular pain', 'ocular melanomas', 'uveal melanomas', 'ocular melanoma', 'enucleation', 'glaucoma', 'retinal detachment', 'iritis', 'end/panophthalmitis', 'intraocular malignancy', 'enucleated globes', 'blindness', 'intraocular tumors', 'melanoma', 'blind painful eye', 'mentally handicapped', 'Intraocular lymphomas of the uveal tract', 'retinal detachment', 'increased intraocular pressure', 'Intraocular tumors', 'blind painful eyes', 'uveal melanomas', 'adenocarcinomas of the retinal pigment epithelium', 'sarcoma', 'pain', 'malignant tumor', 'good prognosis', 'disease', 'extra-ocular involvement', 'intraocular malignancy', 'prognosis was poor', 'intraocular tumors', 'blind painful eyes']",[],"['54', 'Steinert', '1980', '1971', '1978', '1992', 'Naumann', '1976']","['ophthalmic procedures OS', 'cataract surgery', 'uneventful enucleation', 'Histopathologic examination', 'Immunohistochemical study', 'CD20', 'B lymphocytes', 'CD45RO', 'T lymphocytes', 'surgery', 'medications', 'retrobulbar alcohol injection', 'retrobulbar alcohol injection', 'evisceration', 'enucleation', 'enucleation', 'BPE', 'BPE', 'BPE', 'studies of enucleated globes', 'enucleation', 'enucleation', 'ultrasonographic studies']","['since 1980', 'since 1980', '1971', '1978', 'In 1992']"

Twenty-three days prior the patient had undergone orthotopic liver transplantation for chronic active hepatitis C with a T1N0M0 hepatocellular carcinoma. His transplantation was without immediate complication, and he was discharged on the following new medications: bactrim ss daily, aspirin 325 mg daily, azothioprine 100 mg daily, tacrolimus 2 mg daily, and valgancyclovir HCl 900 mg daily. The patient had been treated with antithymocyte globulin during induction of immunosuppression.
The patient did well until 17 days after transplant when he presented with fever. Abdominopelvic computed tomography demonstrated a hepatic subcapsular hematoma, and he was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam for a presumed infected hematoma. He was discharged on posttransplant day 21 on oral ampicillin/sulbactam. Shortly after discharge, he developed diffuse erythroderma, fever, and a sore mouth and returned to the hospital. The burn service was consulted.
The patient was ill-appearing with an oral temperature of 104°F, a heart rate of 122, a blood pressure of 120/64 mm Hg, and a respiratory rate of 24; he had widespread macular erythema and a few hemorrhagic bullae, as well as oropharyngeal ulceration. Nikolsky's sign was positive in multiple locations. He was admitted to the burn intensive care unit and topical antimicrobials were applied to his wounds.
The patient had no known drug allergies. His past history was notable only for type 2 diabetes mellitus and ethanol dependence (abstinent for 1 year). He was taking no alternative medicines. The patient's laboratory results were notable for a serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL (increased over a normal baseline) and a white blood cell count of 0.1 with a differential showing no neutrophils. A skin biopsy revealed full-thickness epithelial necrosis, consistent with a diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or TEN. There was a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis.
Although his airway was initially stable, within 24 hours of admission he was intubated for airway protection as his oropharyngeal mucosa began to disintegrate. Meanwhile, his bullous erythroderma progressed until most of his epidermis had sloughed off and he developed intermittent atrial fibrillation and a vasopressor requirement. In consultation with infectious disease medicine and transplant surgery services, the patient was begun on empiric vancomycin and aztreonam and all of his immunosuppressants were held except for tacrolimus (dose adjusted down).
Over the next several days, the patient's condition continued to decline with anuric renal failure and Staphylococcal/Candidal septic shock. Filgrastim failed to evoke an increase in his circulating neutrophils. He became progressively hypothermic and his septic shock worsened. An ultrasound of the hepatic artery showed that it was patent. Continuous renal replacement therapy was started 4 days after admission. The patient gradually became increasingly acidotic and hypotensive and died 7 days after admission. The patient was given human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) during his course because of a very low measured serum IgG level. At the request of the transplant surgery service, he also received a short course of high-dose solumedrol. Among candidate etiologic agents, sulfa and beta-lactam antibiotics stood out: both of these had been started within the 3 weeks prior to the patient's presentation with TEN and both are known to be frequently implicated in TEN.,","[[55.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['mouth', 'liver', 'Abdominopelvic', 'hepatic subcapsular', 'mouth', 'oral', 'heart', 'macular', 'oropharyngeal', 'skin', 'epithelial', 'papillary dermis', 'airway', 'airway', 'oropharyngeal mucosa', 'epidermis', 'atrial', 'renal', 'hepatic artery', 'renal']","['fever', 'rash', 'sore mouth', 'hepatitis C', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'complication', 'did well', 'fever', 'hepatic subcapsular hematoma', 'infected hematoma', 'erythroderma', 'fever', 'sore mouth', 'ill-appearing', 'macular erythema', 'hemorrhagic bullae', 'oropharyngeal ulceration', ""Nikolsky's sign"", 'wounds', 'diabetes mellitus', 'ethanol dependence', 'neutrophils', 'epithelial necrosis', 'Stevens-Johnson syndrome', 'TEN', 'lymphocytic infiltrate', 'airway was initially stable', 'disintegrate', 'bullous erythroderma', 'atrial fibrillation', 'condition continued to decline', 'anuric renal failure', 'Staphylococcal/Candidal septic shock', 'increase in his circulating neutrophils', 'hypothermic', 'septic shock', 'patent', 'acidotic', 'hypotensive', 'died', 'TEN', 'TEN']","['bactrim ss', 'aspirin', 'azothioprine', 'tacrolimus', 'valgancyclovir HCl', 'antithymocyte globulin', 'piperacillin/tazobactam', 'ampicillin/sulbactam', 'vancomycin', 'aztreonam', 'tacrolimus', 'Filgrastim', 'human', 'solumedrol']","['55', 'burn intensive care unit']","['orthotopic liver transplantation', 'transplantation', 'medications', 'antithymocyte globulin', 'immunosuppression', 'transplant', 'Abdominopelvic computed tomography', 'oral temperature', 'heart rate', 'blood pressure', 'respiratory rate', 'antimicrobials', 'medicines', 'laboratory', 'serum creatinine level', 'white blood cell count', 'differential', 'skin biopsy', 'intubated', 'vasopressor', 'immunosuppressants', 'ultrasound of the hepatic artery', 'renal replacement therapy', 'immunoglobulin', 'IVIG', 'serum IgG level', 'sulfa', 'beta-lactam antibiotics']","['Twenty-three days prior', 'until 17 days', '1 year', '24 hours of admission', 'next several days', '7 days', '3 weeks', '3 weeks', '3 weeks']"

He was a known smoker with no history of analgesic or alcohol abuse. 28 years previously, he had sustained a stab injury to left hypochondrium for which he was managed conservatively.
On examination he was pale, tachycardic and hypotensive (pulse rate of 106/min, blood pressure of 94/55 mm of Hg and saturating 100% on air). Systemic examination revealed no abnormality except black tarry stools in the rectum.
Haemoglobin concentration on admission was 5.9 gm/dl, with a serum urea concentration of 16.2 mmol/lit and serum creatinine of 116 mmol/lit. Liver function test including clotting profile, auto antibody and hepatitis B & C screen were normal. A chest radiograph done revealed opacity in the left lower zone (Fig ).
He responded transiently to fluid resuscitation with the haemoglobin concentration falling to 4.9 gm/dl. An urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was done, which revealed the presence of antral erosions in the stomach and complex gastricfundal varices. No therapeutic intervention was performed.
An ultrasound scan of abdomen revealed an enlarged spleen (15.2 cms), portal vein measuring 11 mm in diameter (upper limit of normal) and prominent veins noted at the splenic hilum. The liver and biliary tree appeared normal.
A computerised tomography scan of abdomen in arterial and venous phase confirmed the presence of a diaphragmatic tear and the spleen to be lying in the left hemi thorax (Fig ). Considerable number of varices was demonstrated in the splenic hilum and perigastric region. The portal vein, its confluence with the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein were patent. The appearances of the splenic vein on the scan were consistent with thrombosis.
A diagnosis of left sided portal hypertension as a result of isolated splenic vein thrombosis secondary to trauma causing a diaphragmatic tear and splenic herniation into the left hemi thorax was made. The patient was offered splenectomy with diaphragmatic repair to treat his splenic vein thrombosis and gastric varices.

Only the ear lobe was left intact. The amputated auricle was placed in a plastic bag with saline, surrounded by ice, and brought to the emergency room with the individual. The patient was immediately started on intravenous antibiotics (Ampicillin/Sulbactam 3 g qid plus metronidazole 500 mg qid), and was led to the operating room approximately four hours following the accident. There, it was decided to reattach the ear as a composite graft. In order to enhance the ""take"", the epidermis and outer layer of the dermis of the posterior aspect of the graft were sharply excised with a scalpel. In addition, multiple small fenestrations were made in the cartilage and posterior-anterior perichondrium. The skin margin of the amputated stump was dermabraded for a distance of 0.5 mm from the edge and a postauricular flap was elevated. Both the graft and the amputated stump of the ear were meticulously cleaned with rigorous use of normal saline and povidone iodine 10%. No injection of topical vasoconstricting agents was used. The anterior skin of the graft was sutured in layers to the amputated stump of the ear and the skin of the helical rim was sutured to the elevated postauricular flap. Two vicryl 3-0 sutures were used for fixation of the graft to the tissues of the mastoid bed (Figure ). A Penrose drain was inserted and a loose bandage was applied. The drain was removed three days later and the patient received additional treatment postoperatively with pentoxiphylline orally (400 mg q8h). Antibiotics were administered for a total period of ten days (five days I.V and five days orally). The patient was strongly advised to stop smoking, and was released from hospital on the 7th postoperative day. The ear developed some epidermolysis during the first 3 weeks following surgery but went on to reepithelialize spontaneously (Figure ). Finally, the replantation was deemed absolutely successful. Three months later, the patient underwent a second operation during which the ear was elevated and the postauricular area was reconstructed with the use of a split-thickness skin graft. No complications have been noted after more than 18 months of follow-up, except of an approximately 10% diminishing in the total size of the auricle compared to the normal side (Figure ).","[[47.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['ear lobe', 'auricle', 'ear', 'epidermis', 'outer layer of the dermis of the posterior aspect of the graft', 'cartilage', 'posterior-anterior perichondrium', 'skin margin of the amputated stump', 'edge', 'postauricular flap', 'stump of the ear', 'anterior skin', 'stump of the ear', 'skin of the helical rim', 'elevated postauricular flap', 'postauricular flap', 'tissues of the mastoid bed', 'ear', 'ear', 'postauricular area', 'skin', 'auricle']","['human bite', 'ear lobe was left intact', 'accident', 'elevated postauricular flap', 'epidermolysis', 'reepithelialize', 'complications', 'diminishing in the total size', 'diminishing in the total size of the auricle']","['saline', 'Ampicillin/Sulbactam', 'metronidazole', 'normal saline', 'povidone iodine', 'pentoxiphylline']","['47', 'emergency room', 'operating room']","['complete amputation of his right ear', 'amputated auricle was placed in a plastic bag with saline', 'amputated auricle was placed in a plastic bag with saline, surrounded by ice', 'antibiotics', 'reattach the ear as a composite graft', 'epidermis and outer layer of the dermis of the posterior aspect of the graft were sharply excised with a scalpel', 'multiple small fenestrations were made in the cartilage and posterior-anterior perichondrium', 'skin margin of the amputated stump was dermabraded for a distance of 0.5 mm from the edge', 'postauricular flap was elevated', 'Both the graft and the amputated stump of the ear were meticulously cleaned with rigorous use of normal saline and povidone iodine 10%', 'vasoconstricting agents', 'anterior skin of the graft was sutured in layers to the amputated stump of the ear', 'skin of the helical rim was sutured to the elevated postauricular flap', 'Two vicryl 3-0 sutures were used for fixation of the graft to the tissues of the mastoid bed', 'Penrose drain was inserted', 'loose bandage was applied', 'drain was removed', 'treatment', 'Antibiotics', 'advised to stop smoking', 'surgery', 'replantation', 'operation', 'ear was elevated', 'postauricular area was reconstructed', 'postauricular area was reconstructed with the use of a split-thickness skin graft']","['three days later', 'postoperatively', 'first 3 weeks', 'Three months later']"
612,1693557-1,17129366,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1693557.xml,Novel mutation of the PRNP gene of a clinical CJD case,"The patient was a 70 year old woman, with a history of diabetes mellitus, who was admitted to the hospital with confusion and inability to walk. Six months prior to admission, her relatives had started recognizing neurological symptoms, such as gait disturbance, memory loss and behavioral disturbances (irritability and aggression). Over the six month period that preceded the admission to the hospital, a rapid deterioration of her cognitive function was observed. She also displayed visual hallucinations and delusions requiring antipsychotic treatment.
On admission, the patient was bedridden, incontinent, severely confused with generalized hyperreflexia, bilateral Babinski sign, startle responses elicited by mild external stimuli, and multifocal generalized myoclonus which evolved to rhythmic. Two months later she developed akinetic mutism. The patient died three months after hospitalization.
Routine hematological and biochemical examinations produced normal results. CSF examination (protein, glucose and cell count) was normal, while EEG showed generalized findings, periodic triphasic sharp waves, recurring at intervals of 0.5–1 sec (Fig ). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no significant abnormalities, except for a minor brain atrophy which could be related to the patient's age.
There was a lack of family history concerning neurological disorders. Although the clinical course followed the typical rapid progression of CJD, the relatives did not consent to having a neuropathological examination carried out, neither did they agree to further genetic investigation of the immediate family members, and thus it has not been possible to determine if the mutation has been passed to the patient's offspring.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected by lumbar puncture. Both the lumbar puncture and the EEG, were performed three and eight days after the patient's admission to the hospital (about six months after the occurrence of the reported symptoms observed by family members).
The proteins contained in 30 μl of CSF were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was stained as described [] with a polyclonal anti-14-3-3β antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-629) and an alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce, 31340). CDP-Phototope Star (New England Biolabs, N701) was used to develop the membrane.
Detection of 14-3-3 protein in CSF, is considered to be a sensitive and specific marker for sporadic CJD. CSF tested positive twice for the presence of 14-3-3 protein (Fig. ), supporting a probable CJD diagnosis [,].
Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using Promega's Wizard genomic DNA purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The proper quality and quantity of the genomic DNA for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was confirmed by spectrophotometry. The PRNP open reading frame was amplified by PCR with the following primers designed as cloning primers; HumoS: 5'- GCT CTA GAG CAT GGC GAA CCT T and HumoAS: 5'- GCT CTA GAT CAT CCC ACG ATC AGG AA. The bases of the primers corresponding to the open reading frame of PRNP are shown in bold. Amplification was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Sequencing was performed first at MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) and then the sequencing results were confirmed by two other independent laboratories (Department of Neurology, University of Crete, MRC Prion Unit and Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, University College, London).
PRNP sequence analysis revealed the existence of a causative mutation at codon 193. Upon comparison with the 762 bp sequence of the human PrP cDNA record (Genebank accession number M13899), it was found that the sequenced PRNP gene exhibits a point mutation at codon 193, comprising nucleotides 577–579. The point mutation occurs as a C to T transition at position 578 which causes the switch of codon 193 from ACC, encoding threonine, to ATC, encoding isoleucine. As shown on the electropherogram (Fig. ), the patient is heterozygous for threonine and isoleucine at codon 193. The patient was found to be homozygous for methionine at codon 129 (M129).","[[70.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['neurological', 'brain', 'brain', 'neurological', 'Cerebrospinal', 'lumbar', 'lumbar', 'membrane', 'membrane', 'membrane', 'codon 193', 'codon 193']","['diabetes mellitus', 'confusion', 'inability to walk', 'neurological symptoms', 'gait disturbance', 'memory loss', 'behavioral disturbances', 'irritability', 'aggression', 'cognitive function', 'visual hallucinations', 'delusions', 'bedridden', 'incontinent', 'confused', 'generalized hyperreflexia', 'bilateral Babinski sign', 'startle responses elicited by mild external stimuli', 'generalized myoclonus', 'akinetic mutism', 'died', 'generalized findings', 'periodic triphasic sharp waves', 'abnormalities', 'brain atrophy', 'neurological disorders', 'CJD', 'mutation', 'Cerebrospinal fluid', 'CSF', 'symptoms', 'sporadic CJD', '14-3-3 protein', 'CJD', 'causative mutation at codon 193', 'sequenced PRNP gene exhibits a point mutation at codon 193', 'point mutation at codon 193', 'point mutation occurs as a C to T transition at position 578', 'switch of codon 193 from ACC, encoding threonine, to ATC, encoding isoleucine', 'heterozygous for threonine and isoleucine', 'homozygous for methionine']",[],"['70', 'Santa Cruz', 'Phototope Star', 'New England Biolabs', 'N701', 'MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany', 'Department of Neurology', 'University of Crete', 'MRC Prion Unit', 'Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'University College, London', 'M13899', '577–579']","['antipsychotic treatment', 'hematological', 'hematological and biochemical examinations', 'biochemical', 'CSF examination', 'protein', 'glucose', 'cell count', 'EEG', 'Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain', 'neuropathological examination', 'genetic investigation', 'lumbar puncture', 'lumbar puncture', 'EEG', 'membrane was stained', 'alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody', 'CDP-Phototope Star', 'Detection of 14-3-3 protein in CSF', 'CSF tested', 'Genomic DNA', 'whole blood', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'spectrophotometry', 'PRNP open reading frame', 'HumoS', 'GCT', 'CTA', 'GAG', 'CAT', 'GGC', 'GAA', 'CCT', 'T', 'HumoAS', 'GCT', 'CTA', 'GAT', 'CAT', 'CCC', 'ACG', 'ATC', 'AGG', 'AA.', 'Amplification', 'agarose gel electrophoresis', 'Sequencing', 'PRNP sequence analysis', 'human PrP cDNA', 'PRNP gene', 'electropherogram']","['Over the six month period', 'preceded the admission', 'Two months later', 'three months']"
613,1693912-1,17134508,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1693912.xml,A case study evaluating the use of clozapine in depression with psychotic features,"A 39-year-old married housewife with 2 children aged 16 and 12 years was electively admitted for treatment of worsening depression.
She had a 5-year history of recurrent severe depressive episodes; there had been no history of mental health problems prior to this. She had been an in-patient for most of the last 5 years, and had required one-to-one nursing on one admission because of self-harming behaviour, which included cutting and trying to set herself on fire.
She had been raped at the age of 12 years; however, prior to her first episode of depression she had a well-adjusted pre-morbid personality, having not had any symptoms suggestive of post traumatic stress disorder prior to her history of depression. A diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder had been considered, however, rejected because her depressive affective symptoms dominated her clinical presentation, and she did not suffer flashbacks to her index traumatic episode. Other diagnoses that merited consideration included schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder, however, she did not suffer from first rank symptoms of schizophrenia or hypomanic/manic episodes which excluded her respectively from both of these diagnoses according to ICD-10.
The depressive symptoms followed soon after a triggering event of a horse-riding accident from which she suffered concussion. A CT scan at the time was reported as normal.
She had a family history of mental disorder, with a sister who suffered from schizophrenia.
During this present admission she had experienced 5-month deterioration in mood. She had a 1-week period of insomnia and increasing suicidal ideation. There was no history of alcohol/substance misuse or any medical problems. She had been receiving ECT treatment twice weekly in the community for the 4 months preceding the admission. The ECT continued after she was admitted. Her medication was:
Lithium carbonate 1000 mg once daily
Mirtazapine 60 mg at night
Olanzapine 20 mg at night
Chlorpromazine 50 mg at night
On MSE, she had psychomotor retardation with poor eye contact and a constant rocking motion. Her affect was melancholic. There was no formal thought or perceptual disorder, or evidence of cognitive impairment.
On 13/8/01 she was started on a 4-day course of dexamethasone, which is an unusual but published treatment for resistant depression (Dexamethasone augmentation in treatment resistant depression Acta Psychiatr Scan 1997; 95 58–61). There were no obvious beneficial effects, and she still felt low in her mood, now with a blunted affect. Her speech was slower and more monotonous. She had decreased motivation. She had worsening suicidal ideation.
On 19/8/01 the patient became very agitated and started lashing out. Several staff members were needed to restrain her and she was sedated with IM lorazepam. The following day she reported hearing voices of her rapists saying derogatory comments to her.
The patient's mirtazapine, chlorpromazine and olanzapine medication were stopped and she was started on haloperidol and amitriptyline. Two days later, she started experiencing second person auditory hallucinations of the rapist who assaulted her in her childhood. She became more restless and agitated. Her suicidal ideation increased and she had difficulty thinking clearly. She continued to receive ECT treatment and her medication was increased to 200 mg amitriptyline and 40 mg of haloperidol.
We felt it was important to formulate an EBM question that could be researched in view of possible treatment approaches that we could offer. We had already tried her on a variety of medical treatments, which had limited benefit.
The question formulated was as follows: 'In a patient who has depression with psychotic symptoms, is the use of clozapine and an antidepressant more beneficial than standard treatments for psychotic depression, in improving mood and psychotic symptoms.'
The literature search that was conducted used the following databases:
Cochrane Database, ACP Journal Club, CCTR, 1986–2002
Medline 1966–2002.
EMBASE 1993–1996.
PSYCHINFO 1887–2002
The manufacturers of clozapine were also contacted.
The keywords used were:
1 'Depression/Depressive disorder/mood disorder/affective disorder/Psychosis/Psychotic'
2 The above keywords were combined with 'clozapine and antidepressant agents'.
The search was originally limited to the years 1986–2002, English language, and human research (however, the limitations were not valid in Cochrane, ACP, DARE, CCTR).

Preoperative routinely performed diagnostic workup revealed no significant findings. During surgery he was laid supine on the operating table with both arms fully adducted to his side, fixed in the neutral position. Intraoperative monitoring included electrocardiography, pulse oxymetry and automatic blood pressure monitoring using a standard-size adult cuff affixed to the patient's right upper arm. No particular events occurred during anesthesia or surgery and recovery was good so that patient was transferred within a day from the intensive care unit to the normal ward.
However, on the first postoperative day he complained of wrist drop on the left. Neurological examination revealed a severe decrease in muscle power of the wrist and finger extensor muscles (0/5 MRC) and a slight brachioradialis paresis (4/5 MRC) accompanied by hypoaesthesia on the radial aspect of the dorsum mani. Biceps and triceps reflexes on the affected left arm were normoactive whereas the brachioradialis reflex was diminished. All muscles innervated from the median and ulnar nerve, as well as all the muscles above the elbow remained unaffected. The clinical diagnosis of radial nerve injury was set and rehabilitation therapy was recommended.
After hospital discharge and about three weeks after surgery the patient was referred for neurophysiological evaluation. In the meanwhile the extensor muscles had already begun to improve. Nerve conduction studies of both radial nerves were performed using surface electrodes. Compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) were recorded from the extensor digitorum communis muscle. The opposite radial nerve was examined for comparison. Supramaximal nerve stimulation was achieved by gradually increasing the stimulation power until the point where the amplitude of the waveform did no longer increased was reached. Electrical stimulation at the elbow, below and above the spiral groove, revealed an amplitude decline of the CMAP that was indicative of a partial conduction block of the left radial nerve along the spiral groove, whereas CMAP recordings of the right radial nerve were normal (Table ). Moreover, motor axonal loss due to wallerian degeneration distal to the site of the lesion was suggested by the low distal CMAP. Needle electromyography enhanced this finding by revealing moderate impairment in recruitment with fibrillation potentials in radial innervated muscles below the elbow and normal findings in both triceps and deltoid muscles. The motor unit potentials were normal, a finding that is consistent with a recent nerve injury. In conclusion, all electrophysiological findings were indicative of a radial nerve injury in the spiral groove. The involvement of the brachioradialis muscle and the fact that both deltoid and triceps muscles remained unaffected practically excluded the differential diagnostic alternative of a posterior interosseus neuropathy and a posterior cord brachial plexus lesion respectively.","[[52.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['heart', 'neurological', 'coronary artery', 'both arms', 'arms', 'right upper arm', 'wrist', 'Neurological', 'muscle', 'wrist', 'finger extensor muscles', 'brachioradialis', 'radial aspect of the dorsum mani', 'Biceps', 'triceps', 'left arm', 'arm', 'brachioradialis', 'brachioradialis reflex', 'All muscles', 'All muscles innervated from the median and ulnar nerve', 'all the muscles above the elbow', 'radial nerve', 'extensor muscles', 'Nerve', 'both radial nerves', 'muscle', 'extensor digitorum communis muscle', 'muscle', 'opposite radial nerve', 'Supramaximal nerve', 'elbow', 'left radial nerve along the spiral groove', 'right radial nerve', 'wallerian degeneration distal to the site of the lesion', 'radial innervated muscles below the elbow', 'both triceps', 'deltoid muscles', 'motor unit', 'nerve', 'radial nerve', 'spiral groove', 'brachioradialis muscle', 'both deltoid and triceps muscles', 'posterior interosseus', 'posterior cord brachial plexus', 'cord brachial plexus']","['obese', 'ischemic heart disease', 'neurological disease', 'significant findings', 'particular events', 'recovery was good', 'wrist drop', 'decrease in muscle power', 'MRC', 'brachioradialis paresis', 'MRC', 'hypoaesthesia', 'reflexes', 'normoactive', 'brachioradialis reflex', 'brachioradialis reflex was diminished', 'unaffected', 'radial nerve injury', 'begun to improve', 'amplitude decline of the CMAP', 'conduction block of the left radial nerve along the spiral groove', 'motor axonal loss', 'wallerian degeneration distal to the site of the lesion', 'low distal CMAP', 'impairment in recruitment', 'fibrillation potentials', 'normal findings', 'motor unit potentials were normal', 'nerve injury', 'radial nerve injury', 'involvement of the brachioradialis muscle', 'unaffected', 'posterior interosseus neuropathy', 'posterior cord brachial plexus lesion', 'cord brachial plexus lesion']",[],"['52-year', 'intensive care unit']","['coronary artery bypass surgery', 'diagnostic workup', 'surgery', 'both arms fully adducted to his side', 'fixed in the neutral position', 'electrocardiography', 'pulse oxymetry', 'automatic blood pressure monitoring', 'anesthesia', 'surgery', 'MRC', 'rehabilitation therapy', 'surgery', 'neurophysiological evaluation', 'Nerve conduction studies of both radial nerves', 'Compound muscle action potentials (CMAP)', 'Supramaximal nerve stimulation was achieved by gradually increasing the stimulation power until the point where the amplitude of the waveform did no longer increased was reached', 'Electrical stimulation at the elbow, below and above the spiral groove', 'CMAP recordings of the right radial nerve', 'CMAP', 'Needle electromyography']","['Preoperative', 'three weeks']"

616,1697810-1,17112390,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1697810.xml,"Concurrent development of testicular seminoma and choriocarcinoma of the superior mediastinum, presented as cervical mass: a case report and implications about pathogenesis of germ-cell tumours","A 25-year-old male was presented in October 2004 with a monthly history of a gradually enlarging, painless, left cervical mass. He had no history of prior thyroid disorder or other disease. Clinically the mass was hard in palpation, firmly attached to the surrounding tissues and was located at the anatomic area of the carotide triangle. Thorough physical examination revealed only a marginal hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Routine blood tests, biochemical markers and thyroid function tests – including triiodothyronine (T3), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyreoglobulin and anti-thyroid antibodies- were within normal limits, with the exception of a moderately elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR = 44). Subsequent cervical and thoracic CT scan revealed a multilobular mass (4,3 × 4,7 × 7 cm) probably arising from the left thyroid lobe, with infiltrating features and heterogeneous density with regions of central necrosis and hemorrhage. The mass submerged into the anterior-posterior mediastinum, in proximity with the great vessels of the heart, dislocating the left common carotid artery and the left vagus nerve without infiltrating them (Fig. and ). Significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy was also noted, whereas ultrasound of the abdomen excluded liver involvement. Differential diagnosis included thyroid carcinoma, lymphoma, thymoma, malignant congenital branchiac cyst or cystic hygroma and germ cell tumours of the upper mediastinum. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the cervical mass was performed and the cytological findings were consistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma with anaplastic features. Based on these findings, the patient was referred for surgical removal of the lesion. At surgery, a large mass, measuring 9,5 × 6,3 × 4,5 cm was found behind the left srenocleidomastoid muscle, located lateral to the left carotid artery/jugular vein and was not firmly adhered to the left thyroid lobe. The mass was easily separated from the surrounded tissues and was removed. Based on the results of preoperative fine needle aspiration biopsy, a total thyroidectomy was performed at the same time. Pathology examination of the mass revealed extensive infiltration by large or giant malignant cells with morphological features consistent with syncytiotrophoblasts within necrotic and hemorrhagic elements (Fig. ). Positive immunohistochemical staining with β-subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) suggested the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma of the upper mediastinum (Fig. ). The pre-operation serum concentration of β-hCG was >100.000 mIU/ml, whereas the immediate post-operation levels declined to 17.300 mIU/ml. Alpha- fetoprotein (a-FP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were within normal limits, while lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was two-fold higher than the normal upper limit. Based on these data, scrotal ultrasound examination was performed, disclosing a small multilobular mass measuring 2,1 cm in greatest diameter-not evident at previously performed physical examination- located on the upper pole of the left testicle with echomorphological and hemodynamic characteristics consistent with seminomatous tumour. Subsequently, the patient underwent left radical inguinal orchiectomy with high ligation of the left spermatic cord and implantation of synthetic testicular prothesis. Histological diagnosis of the testicular tumour revealed almost typical seminoma (1,8 × 1,2 × 1 cm) consisting of large clear-cytoplasm cells with hypodense nucleus and a few atypical mitosis, without any signs of infiltration of rete testis or the spermatic cord. Complete inhibition of spermatogenesis and hyperplastic reaction of Leydig cells were also observed (Fig. ). Although immunohistochemical staining for β-hCG was positive in a few cells, their morphological characteristics did not meet the diagnostic criteria for syncytiotrophoblasts (Fig. ). On postoperative day six (6), the patient developed slightly painful cervical mass at the anatomic site of the first surgical intervention and β-hCG levels started rising up again (β-hCG = 29.850 mIU/ml) (Fig. ). Complete pre-therapeutic staging was immediately performed, including negative CT scan of the brain and negative bone scan, whereas CT scan of the thorax and the abdomen disclosed multiple round metastatic nodules of various size (0,1 – 2 cm) in both lungs and marginally enlarged iliac and para-aortic lymph nodes without liver or other parenchymal organ involvement. In November 2004, one month after his initial admission to the hospital, the patient received 1st line chemotherapy for high-risk germ cell tumour with the BEP regimen (Bleomycin 30 mg: d1-d8-d15, Etoposide 100 mg/m2: d1-d5 and Cisplatin 20 mg/m2: d1-d5 in 21-day cycles). Pre-chemotherapy levels of β-hCG were 93.400 mIU/ml. The patient completed 4 cycles of therapy without experiencing remarkable toxicity (Neutropenia grade I-II according to the NCI-CTC criteria) and is currently (October 2006) asymptomatic, with ongoing complete clinical and biochemical remission according to the RECIST criteria (No evidence of tumour mass, regression of all enlarged lymph nodes, necrotic post-chemotherapy elements in the remaining lung nodules confirmed by CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy and PET scan and consecutively normal levels of β-hCG).

She underwent CT imaging that revealed bilateral ovarian masses and ascites. Preoperative CA125 was the only tumor marker examined and it was within normal limits. A presumptive diagnosis of ovarian cancer was made and she underwent exploratory laparotomy which revealed macroscopic peritoneal metastases to ovaries, omentum and pelvic peritoneum. At that time total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoopherectomy, pelvic lymph node sampling, partial omentectomy, appendectomy and evacuation of mucinous ascites was performed. Final pathology revealed low grade mucinous adenocarcinoma in all specimens, arising from an appendiceal primary. The patient received no additional therapy and was followed clinically. She developed recurrent abdominal pain approximately 2 years later. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed progressive nodularity in the mesentery and peritoneal surfaces consistent with recurrent disease. This was further evaluated with a laparoscopy, which revealed mucinous tumor implants along the anterior abdominal wall, right retroperitoneum, diaphragm, and remaining omentum (Figure ). At this time, the patient was referred to the University of Cincinnati for consideration of cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion. The patient's past medical history was significant only for a seizure disorder which was managed by anticonvulsant medication and an implanted vagus nerve stimulator. Preoperative CA19-9 was elevated at 59, while CEA and CA-125 were normal. The patient was felt to be an appropriate candidate and underwent exploration. At surgery, extensive disease was noted over the peritoneal surfaces. A complete cytoreduction was achieved requiring, right colectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy, omentectomy, and perionectomies of the diaphragms, anterior abdominal wall, and pelvis. Tumor nodules were excised from the small bowel and large bowel mesentery. The cytoreductive portion of the operation was completed in approximately 210 minutes. Per our current practice protocol, a 90 minute perfusion was performed using an inflow temperature of 44°C, with peritoneal surface temperatures averaging 40.5–41.5°C. Intraperitoneal temperatures were measured via four temperature probes, one within the liver parenchyma, and three within separate quadrants of the peritoneum. Core temperature was recorded via the bladder and esophageal temperature probes. Per our standard protocol, the carrier solution was peritoneal dialysis fluid (2.5%). The patient's maximum recorded core body temperature during the procedure was 38.7°C and the maximum recorded liver temperature was 38.8°C. Mitomycin C was delivered using a total dose of 10 mg/L perfusate, delivered in divided doses of 7 mg/L at initiation and redosed after 45 minutes at 3 mg/L. A total dose of 45 mg was delivered in this patient. During the operation, the patient had no significant electrolyte abnormalities aside from the expected glucose elevation seen during the perfusion period. The maximum serum glucose was 355 mg/dL and the lowest serum sodium was 135. The operation was generally uneventful; no blood transfusions were required and the patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. Postoperatively, all serum electrolytes were normal and albumin was 3.4 mg/dl compared with 4.3 mg/dl, preoperatively. The patient was easily arousable and followed commands appropriately. However, approximately 4 hrs later, the patient complained of headache and right eye pain. Her headache was treated with analgesics, however 3 hours later, she was found to be tachypenic, bradycardic, and hypotensive, and was unresponsive with fixed, dilated pupils. She was emergently intubated and resuscitated. After approximately 15 minutes, she regained consciousness, and responded appropriately to commands. Her pupils returned to 3 mm and because reactive. Neurology was consulted and she was loaded with Dilantin due to her history of seizure disorder. An urgent CT scan was ordered. On route to the CT scanner, she once again became bradycardic and hypotensive with fixed, dilated pupils. The CT scan revealed diffuse cerebral edema (Figure ). ICP monitoring revealed pressures of 70–90 mmHg. Mannitol was used in an attempt to lower intracranial pressure without success. EEG was consistent with diffuse brain dysfunction. A brain death protocol revealed that she had suffered brain death and care was subsequently withdrawn. At autopsy, diffuse cerebral edema with tonsillar herniation was noted (Figure ). No pathologic findings were present to indicate the cause of the cerebral edema. The final pathology on all resected specimens reconfirmed the diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma (Figure ).","[[37.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['abdominal', 'bilateral ovarian', 'ovarian', 'peritoneal', 'ovaries', 'omentum', 'pelvic peritoneum', 'total abdominal', 'pelvic lymph node', 'appendiceal', 'abdominal', 'mesentery', 'peritoneal surfaces', 'anterior abdominal wall', 'right retroperitoneum', 'diaphragm', 'omentum', 'intraperitoneal', 'vagus nerve', 'peritoneal surfaces', 'diaphragms', 'anterior abdominal wall', 'pelvis', 'small bowel', 'large bowel mesentery', 'peritoneal surface', 'Intraperitoneal', 'liver parenchyma', 'quadrants of the peritoneum', 'bladder', 'esophageal', 'peritoneal', 'core body', 'body', 'liver', 'right eye', 'pupils', 'pupils', 'pupils', 'cerebral', 'intracranial', 'brain', 'brain', 'brain', 'cerebral', 'tonsillar', 'cerebral']","['abdominal pain', 'masses', 'ascites', 'ovarian cancer', 'macroscopic peritoneal metastases', 'mucinous ascites', 'mucinous adenocarcinoma', 'abdominal pain', 'nodularity', 'disease', 'mucinous tumor implants', 'remaining omentum', 'seizure disorder', 'CA19-9', 'disease', 'Tumor nodules', 'electrolyte abnormalities', 'glucose elevation', 'stable condition', 'easily arousable', 'followed commands appropriately', 'headache', 'right eye pain', 'headache', 'tachypenic', 'bradycardic', 'hypotensive', 'unresponsive', 'fixed', 'dilated pupils', 'regained consciousness', 'responded appropriately to commands', 'reactive', 'seizure disorder', 'bradycardic', 'hypotensive', 'fixed', 'dilated pupils', 'cerebral edema', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain death', 'brain death', 'cerebral edema', 'tonsillar herniation', 'pathologic findings', 'cerebral edema', 'mucinous adenocarcinoma']","['Mitomycin C', 'Dilantin', 'Mannitol']","['37', 'University of Cincinnati', 'ICU']","['CT imaging', 'CA125', 'tumor marker', 'exploratory laparotomy', 'total abdominal hysterectomy', 'bilateral salpingoopherectomy', 'pelvic lymph node sampling', 'partial omentectomy', 'appendectomy', 'evacuation of mucinous ascites', 'pathology', 'therapy', 'Computed tomography (CT) scan', 'CT', 'laparoscopy', 'cytoreductive surgery', 'intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion', 'anticonvulsant medication', 'implanted vagus nerve stimulator', 'CA19-9', 'CEA', 'CA-125', 'exploration', 'surgery', 'complete cytoreduction', 'right colectomy', 'splenectomy', 'cholecystectomy', 'omentectomy', 'perionectomies', 'Tumor nodules were excised from the small bowel and large bowel mesentery', 'cytoreductive portion of the operation', '90 minute perfusion', 'peritoneal surface temperatures', 'Intraperitoneal temperatures', 'Core temperature', 'peritoneal dialysis fluid', 'maximum recorded core body temperature', 'maximum recorded liver temperature', 'maximum serum glucose', 'lowest serum sodium', 'blood transfusions', 'serum electrolytes', 'albumin', 'analgesics', 'intubated', 'resuscitated', 'CT scan', 'CT scanner', 'CT scan', 'ICP monitoring', 'pressures', 'EEG', 'autopsy', 'pathology']","['Preoperative', 'At that time', 'At that time', 'At that time', 'At that time', 'At that time', 'approximately 2 years later', 'At this time', 'At this time', 'Preoperative', 'Preoperative', 'Postoperatively', 'preoperatively', 'approximately 4 hrs later', 'approximately 4 hrs later']"

his GP with a painful right knee with no history of trauma. This was
diagnosed as a soft tissue injury, but, six months later, he noticed a
swelling in his right proximal tibia. A plain x-ray showed a pathological
fracture of the proximal tibia () and he was referred to the regional sarcoma centre via his local fracture clinic.
His initial investigations of blood tests, chest x-ray, and abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities, but MRI right knee clearly demonstrated an osteosarcoma in the proximal tibia with further lesions in the distal femur ().
A biopsy of the proximal tibial lesion confirmed the diagnosis of high-grade
intramedullary osteosarcoma (). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy of five
cycles of doxorubicin and cisplatin was commenced.
The preoperative CT chest was clear and a further biopsy of both the distal
tibial and proximal femoral lesions confirmed high-grade intramedullary
osteosarcoma with necrosis. Because of this good response to chemotherapy,
the decision was made to conserve the leg. Therefore, six months after
diagnosis, the patient underwent resection of the right proximal tibia and
distal femur with prosthetic replacement (). The final histology showed necrotic bone tumour in the femoral and tibial lesions.
The patient underwent three months of postoperative chemotherapy
and he remains clinically well. Nine months later, he was

our department with a 10-year history of problems extending her
left elbow. Examination demonstrated 50 degrees of fixed flexion
contracture of her left elbow. There were no palpable masses and
no convincing tenderness around the elbow. An X-ray and CT scan of
the elbow were unremarkable but an MRI scan showed a soft tissue
mass lying on the anterior capsule of the elbow, deep to
brachialis muscle ().
She underwent excision biopsy of the mass. An arm tourniquet was
used. Through an anterolateral approach the brachioradialis muscle
was identified and reflected laterally. Furthermore the radial
nerve was identified and reflected. As brachialis muscle was
lifted up a long fatty, vascular mass deep to it was encountered
which was about 3 × 1.5 cm in size. It was
removed from underlying bone and capsule of elbow joint and sent
for histology. A gentle capsular release was performed as well.
An examination under anaesthetic showed that the elbow was now
fully extended but was spring due to tight muscles. At the end of
the operation, the fixed flexion contracture was 20 degrees. The
patient was discharged the following day and outpatient
physiotherapy was arranged. At six weeks follow up the patient had
full extension of the elbow.

He had no abdominal pain and no symptoms or signs of gastro-intestinal blood loss. He was initially thought to have gastroenteritis, stool samples were sent and he was treated conservatively. He was noted to be mildly anaemic with a haemoglobin level of 10.7. A flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) was performed to begin investigation of his diarrhoea. This showed a small polyp which was benign on histology and no other abnormality. He settled and was then discharged home. Barium enema (BE) was booked as an outpatient investigation to assess the rest of the colon, and if negative, oesophageogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) would then be performed to investigate his anaemia. The waiting list for colonoscopy was too lengthy at that time, and the combination of BE and FS routinely replaced colonoscopy.
The patient was readmitted three weeks later in hypovolaemic shock with a blood pressure of 88/56, pulse 110. During this admission, he was noted to be cachetic, weighing just over 55 kilograms (Body mass index = 16.2). On further questioning he had lost over 12 kilograms in weight since the onset of his vomiting several weeks before. His admission haemoglobin level on this admission was 7.5.
In view of the worsening anaemia on this admission and a past history of duodenal ulcer in 1996, in-patient OGD and BE were requested. Meanwhile, the patient continued to receive intravenous fluid, blood and acid suppressing agents. OGD revealed an opening in the second part of the duodenum, which was biopsied. Histology showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and one piece of normal colonic mucosa. BE clearly demonstrated a fistula between the hepatic flexure and second part of duodenum (figure ), and the patient vomited the barium following his enema.
Subsequent isotope bone scan and liver ultrasound did not show any signs of metastasis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a locally advanced carcinoma of the proximal transverse colon (figure ), with a fistula to the duodenum. The regional lymph nodes were noted to be enlarged and there was enlargement of the left adrenal of uncertain significance. There was also a small volume of ascites.
Clinically during the patients admission a subcutaneous nodule developed on the right abdominal wall. The mass was erythematous, non-tender, mobile and deep to skin. Fine needle aspiration cytology confirmed subcutaneous metastasis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (figure ). Over the next few weeks a similar subcutaneous metastasis developed over his left scapular area.
The patient's nutritional status was corrected. His vomiting had stopped. It was explained to him and his family that surgery was inappropriate. He was discussed at the multidisciplinary meeting but the feeling was that chemotherapy would serve only to enlarge the fistula and be likely to exacerbate his symptoms without any great benefit to him. Radiotherapy directed at the subcutaneous lesions was utilised as the only feasible option of palliation. A palliative ileostomy with a feeding jejunostomy was considered, however, the patient was reluctant with the prospect of having an ileostomy especially his symptoms were well controlled. His care was subsequently transferred to a palliative care unit.

There was no information about histological diagnosis of the excised breast lesion from the first hospital. There were no systemic symptoms. She was Para 7+1 and had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Physical examination revealed globular enlargement of the left breast measuring 20 cm × 18 cm. The mass occupied the whole breast, was warm, multinodular and fixed to the pectoralis fascia. The ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes were enlarged, but examination of the other systems was normal. A clinical diagnosis of locally advanced cancer of the left breast was made.
Plain radiograph of the chest and abdominal ultrasound scan were normal. A core-needle biopsy of the mass was done and histology showed a malignant neoplasm comprising islands of chondroblastic and osteoblastic stromal cells, with no normal breast tissue seen. A diagnosis of osteogenic sarcoma was made. The patient had a left modified radical mastectomy and latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap to cover an anterior chest wall defect. The mastectomy specimen weighed 350 g. Cut sections revealed areas of cystic degeneration and necrosis, with focal areas that were firm with a cartilaginous consistency. Conventional representative sections were obtained from each of the four breast quadrants, areola region, resection margins and axillary lymph nodes. Microscopic examination of the sections showed a malignant breast neoplasm displaying fibrosarcomatous, chondrosarcomatous (Figure ) as well as osteosarcomatous (Figure ) differentiation.

The general examination of the patient was unrevealing, with no lymphadenopathy or bony tenderness. The chest, cardiovascular and neurological examination was normal. Abdominal examination revealed a mildly tender mass palpable in the right lumbar region. Routine laboratory investigations including a full blood count, chest X-ray, and renal function tests were normal. Urine examination showed plenty of RBCs in high power field.
An ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed an echogenic mass in the upper part of the right kidney measuring 11 × 10 cm. No calcified areas were noted; the renal pelvis and renal vein were not involved. The other abdominal viscera were radiologically normal. There was no lymph node enlargement. A provisional diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma was made and right radical nephrectomy performed.
Grossly, the nephrectomy specimen weighed 480 grams and showed a solid spherical tumor measuring 10.5 × 10 cm. The cut surface was variegated with grey white, fish flesh appearance. The adjacent renal parenchyma appeared normal. The renal capsule was intact. There was no involvement of the renal pelvis or vein.
Microscopically, the tumor was highly cellular comprising of epithelial, blastemic and stromal elements. The epithelial element comprised of tubules admixed with blastemic cells (Fig. ). The tubular lining cells had elongated, molded, and wedge shaped nuclei exhibiting frequent mitoses. The tubular pattern resembled pseudo-rosettes at places (Fig. ). The blastemic component had solid areas showing cells with oval nuclei and scanty cytoplasm. The stroma with spindle cells had no specific differentiation. There was no area showing anaplasia. A final diagnosis of adult Wilms' tumor with triphasic pattern and a favorable histology, stage 2, was made.

The swelling had recently started to grow rapidly. There were no associated sensory symptoms. In addition, a few teeth adjacent to the swelling had become loose, carious and had fallen off. Local physical examination showed a 4.0 × 3.2 × 3.0 cm, tender, firm, irregular lump that appeared to arise from the left mandible. Intra orally, the tumor could be seen as a pink, bulging and fleshy mass. Two lymph nodes were palpable, one in left submaxillary region measuring approximately 1 × 1 cm and the other in the left cervical region and was barely palpable. Remainder of the physical examination was not contributory and no other swelling was noticed. Orthopantomogram (OPG) of the jaw showed a radiolucent lesion with irregular margins, centered in and destroying a portion of the left mandibular body (Figure ). The teeth adjacent to the mass were carious and some were missing. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the oral cavity and neck was advised but was not done due to financial reasons. A clinical diagnosis of ameloblastoma with suspicion of lymph node involvement was given.
An incisional biopsy of the lesion was submitted for pathologic evaluation. Microscopic examination of the tissue showed a neoplasm composed of epithelial cells arranged in irregular nests separated by fibrovascular septa. The cells adjacent to the fibrovascular septa were cuboidal to columnar with high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and eosinophilic cytoplasm, while those in the center of the nests were larger and polygonal, with abundant clear cytoplasm (Figure ). Each cell had a single nucleus with fine chromatin and prominent eosinophilic nucleolus. The cells at the periphery of the nests occasionally demonstrated nuclear palisading away from the basement membrane, i.e., reverse nuclear polarity (Figure ). These peripheral cells also showed occasional mitoses. The central areas of the nests and fibrous septae showed infiltration by neutrophils. The cells were immunoreactive for pan-cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and S-100 protein; they did not stain for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and HMB-45. The abundant, clear cytoplasm of the cells was strongly positive for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) (Figure ). This PAS positivity was diastase sensitive indicating intracytoplasmic glycogen (Figure ). A diagnosis of clear cell odontogenic carcinoma was entertained. Fine needle aspiration from the submaxillary node was done but was inconclusive.
The patient was referred to a specialty cancer hospital where she underwent left hemimandibulectomy with ipsilateral functional neck dissection (level1 to level 5). The reconstruction was done using ipsilateral 12th rib and the soft tissue coverage was given by pectoralis major flap. Postoperative histopathological examination showed tumor morphology similar to incisional biopsy and 1/11 lymph nodes (submaxillary) was positive for the tumor metastasis without any extranodal spread. The tumor was extending into the soft tissue and the left bony margin was positive for the tumor cells. Due to the positive margin, the patient was referred for adjuvant radiotherapy for which she refused to give consent.

The patient underwent an emergency contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis which showed an markedly abnormal spleen, inhomogeneous and enlarged, approximately 20 × 11 cm with fluid in the inferior aspect of the mesenteric fat, with free fluid in the abdomen and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
The patient was volume resuscitated following admission to the hospital, and his Hct was serially followed. Since there was no history of trauma and the CT did not look like a traumatic splenic laceration the oncology service was contacted who felt that the findings were most compatible with lymphoma and because there was some bleeding going on did not recommend trying to treat it without a tissue diagnosis.
The patient underwent a splenectomy. He was found to have a massively enlarged spleen with areas where it appeared to be tumor extruding through the splenic capsule. There was a lot of ecchymotic tissue inferior to where the spleen had been and there was slight oozing which was controlled as much as possible as the area was quite friable. The tail of the pancreas was identified and left alone as there was no bleeding. The estimated blood loss was approx 2 L.
Following extubation the patient had some issues with agitation which was attributable to ETOH withdrawal. The patient had a history of 6pack qd ETOH abuse. He was placed on CIWA protocol. His mental status remained at the level of agitation and confusion for the next 4 days not helped by serax or ativan or haldol. Psychiatry consult was given and they felt the agitation was secondary to post op delirium vs. paradoxical ativan reaction. At that point it was thought that the agitation and delirium was secondary to possible 'pain vs. sepsis.' He was started on cefazolin 1 gm q8 hrs post op which was changed to meropenem 1 gm q 12 hr on POD#4.
In the post operative period the patient's Hct remained stable on serial examination. however his Bilirubin continually rose and peaked at 10.5 on post op day # 3. Other LFT s were mildly elevated. Gastroenterology team was consulted who felt that the increase bilirubin was secondary to sepsis. Differential diagnosis of hemolysis was considered but was thought unlikely as the Hct remained stable. Biliary obstruction was unlikely given his LFT s were only mildly elevated. A hepatitis panel was run and the patient was found to be positive for Hepatitis C. Anesthesia related rise in bilirubin was also considered but again AST and ALT were mildly elevated.
The patient was discharged home on post op day #9 on PO Moxifloxacin 400 mg q d for 5 days to complete a 14 day course of antibiotics. His liver function test lab values were almost near normal on discharge.","[[43.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['left upper abdominal', 'abdomen/pelvis', 'spleen', 'inferior aspect of the mesenteric fat', 'abdomen', 'retroperitoneal lymph nodes', 'splenic', 'tissue', 'spleen', 'splenic capsule', 'tissue inferior', 'spleen', 'tail of the pancreas', 'mental status', 'Biliary', 'liver']","['left upper abdominal pain', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'dizziness', 'anorexia', 'abnormal spleen', 'fluid', 'free fluid', 'enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes', 'trauma', 'traumatic splenic laceration', 'lymphoma', 'bleeding', 'tissue diagnosis', 'enlarged spleen', 'tumor extruding through the splenic capsule', 'ecchymotic tissue inferior', 'oozing', 'bleeding', 'issues', 'agitation', 'ETOH withdrawal', 'ETOH abuse', 'agitation', 'confusion', 'agitation', 'delirium', 'paradoxical ativan reaction', 'agitation', 'delirium', 'pain', 'sepsis', 'increase bilirubin', 'sepsis', 'hemolysis', 'Biliary obstruction', 'Hepatitis C.', 'Anesthesia related rise in bilirubin']","['serax', 'ativan', 'haldol', 'ativan', 'cefazolin', 'meropenem', 'Moxifloxacin']","['43year', 'Emergency Department']","['emergency contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis', 'volume resuscitated', 'Hct', 'CT', 'treat', 'splenectomy', 'estimated blood loss', 'extubation', 'CIWA protocol', 'Hct', 'Bilirubin', 'LFT s', 'bilirubin', 'Hct', 'LFT s', 'hepatitis panel', 'bilirubin', 'AST', 'ALT', 'antibiotics', 'liver function test', 'lab']","['a day old', '2 days', '2 days', 'next 4 days', 'next 4 days', 'post op', 'post op', 'POD#4', 'post operative', 'post op day # 3', 'post op day #9']"

The patient's past medical history included ovarian endometriosis treated with bilateral oophorectomy in another hospital seven years earlier. She subsequently received treatment with medroxyprogesterone and transdermal estrogens.
On physical examination the abdomen was distended and bowel sounds were increased. Laboratory values were unremarkable, and abdominal x-rays confirmed the diagnosis of intestinal obstruction. Laparotomy revealed an ileal mass protruding into the lumen. A right hemicolectomy including 40 cm of ileum was performed. The female genital tract and pelvis had no macroscopic evidence of endometriotic lesions.
Histopathology revealed the following: the resection specimen consisted of 16 cm of right colon and 39 cm of ileum. A tumor measuring 5.5 cm was found within the wall of the ileum 2 cm from the ileocaecal valve. Morphologic and immunohistochemical features were typical of an endometrioid adenocarcinoma (cytokeratin (CK) 7-positive, vimentin-positive, CK20-negative) (figure ). The high nuclear grade tumor involved the mucosa, the muscularis propria and the subserosal fat. Vascular invasion was noted as well as metastatic involvement of 5 out of 40 isolated lymph nodes. Several foci of endometriosis were identified adjacent to this mass and in the caecum. Both, the epithelial and the stromal cells tested positive for estrogen receptors and for CK7, while tests for CK20 proved negative. The tumor itself showed only weak positivity for estrogen receptors.
After surgery the patient received subsequent chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. Twenty months later the patient noted rectal bleeding. A colonoscopy discovered a mass at 15 cm from the anal edge. The biopsy showed an adenocarcinoma. A second endometrioid adenocarcinoma was not suspected before surgery.
During laparotomy a tumor in the anterior wall of the rectum was seen. It was fixed to the uterus, occupying the recto-uterine pouch which it seemed to invade. No macroscopic endometrioid foci were seen in the pelvis. En bloc resection including rectum, uterus and the fallopian tubes was performed, as an invasion of the uterus was suspected. Transit restoration was achieved by termino-terminal anastomosis using the EEA-stapler device.
Histopathology revealed the following: The resection specimen consisted of 18 cm of rectum, the uterus and the fallopian tubes. Histological examination confirmed the presence of a tumor measuring 3.5 cm in diameter, located in the anterior wall of the rectum and embedded to the posterior wall of the uterus. The poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma involved all layers of the intestine up to the uterus which was not invaded microscopically. The uterus and the fallopian tubes had no major microscopic changes. Morphological and immunohistochemical features of this endometriotic adenocarcinoma were similar to the previously removed tumor (CK7- positive, vimentin-positive, and CK20 negative) (figure ). There was no lymph node involvement in any of the 17 removed lymph nodes. Multiple microscopic foci of endometriosis were seen, especially in the peritumoral and peritubaric areas. Once again, immunohistochemical features of these foci included positive estrogen receptors and a positive result on CK7 in the epithelial and stromal cells, and negative results for CK20. After the second operation, the patient started treatment with raltitrexed (Tomudex®) and 5-Fluorouracil. After five years, she remains asymptomatic and has no evidence of recurrence.","[[45.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['abdominal', 'ovarian', 'abdomen', 'bowel', 'abdominal', 'intestinal', 'ileal', 'lumen', '40 cm of ileum', 'female genital tract', 'pelvis', '16 cm of right colon', '39 cm of ileum', 'wall', 'wall of the ileum 2 cm from the ileocaecal valve', 'endometrioid', 'mucosa', 'muscularis propria', 'subserosal fat', 'Vascular', '5 out of 40 isolated lymph nodes', 'adjacent to this mass', 'caecum', 'epithelial', 'stromal cells', 'rectal', 'at 15 cm from the anal edge', 'endometrioid', 'anterior wall of the rectum', 'uterus', 'recto-uterine pouch', 'pelvis', 'rectum', 'uterus', 'fallopian', 'fallopian tubes', 'uterus', '18 cm of rectum', 'uterus', 'fallopian tubes', 'anterior wall of the rectum', 'posterior wall of the uterus', 'all layers of the intestine up to the uterus', 'uterus', 'lymph node', 'lymph nodes', 'peritumoral', 'peritubaric areas', 'epithelial', 'stromal cells']","['abdominal pain', 'vomiting', 'ovarian endometriosis', 'distended', 'bowel sounds were increased', 'intestinal obstruction', 'ileal mass', 'endometriotic lesions', 'resection specimen', 'tumor', 'Morphologic and immunohistochemical features were typical', 'endometrioid adenocarcinoma', 'tumor', 'Vascular invasion', 'metastatic involvement', 'endometriosis', 'mass', 'positive for estrogen receptors', 'tumor', 'estrogen receptors', 'rectal bleeding', 'mass', 'adenocarcinoma', 'endometrioid adenocarcinoma', 'adenocarcinoma', 'tumor', 'macroscopic endometrioid foci', 'invasion of the uterus', 'resection specimen', 'tumor', 'adenocarcinoma', 'microscopic changes', 'endometriotic adenocarcinoma', 'lymph node involvement', 'endometriosis', 'immunohistochemical features of these foci', 'positive estrogen receptors', 'asymptomatic', 'recurrence']","['medroxyprogesterone', '5-fluorouracil', 'leucovorin', 'raltitrexed', 'Tomudex®', 'Fluorouracil']",['45'],"['bilateral oophorectomy', 'treatment', 'estrogens', 'physical examination', 'Laboratory', 'abdominal x-rays', 'Laparotomy', 'right hemicolectomy including 40 cm of ileum', 'Histopathology', 'cytokeratin (CK)', 'vimentin-positive', 'CK20-negative', 'CK7', 'CK20', 'estrogen receptors', 'surgery', 'chemotherapy', 'colonoscopy', 'biopsy', 'surgery', 'laparotomy', 'En bloc resection including rectum, uterus and the fallopian tubes', 'Transit restoration was achieved by termino-terminal anastomosis using the EEA-stapler device', 'Histopathology', 'Histological examination', 'removed tumor', 'CK7', 'vimentin-positive', 'CK20', 'immunohistochemical', 'CK7', 'CK7 in the epithelial and stromal cells', 'CK20', 'second operation', 'treatment']","['5 month', '5 month', 'seven years earlier', 'Twenty months later', 'After five years']"

There was no positive family history. The remaining history was unremarkable.
On admission he was partially weight bearing on the affected side. On inspection there were no signs of inflammation. Flexion was limited to100 degrees; extension to 20 degrees; internal and external rotation were reduced to 10 degrees with normal adduction and abduction. There were no further positive findings on the remainder of physical examination or X-ray (figure ).
Blood results on admission were haemoglobin 12.5 g/dl (12.5–18.0 g/dl), white cell count 6.47 (4.0–11.0 × 109/l), Platelets 378 (150–400 × 109/l), C reactive protein (CRP) 205 (<5 mg/l), Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 96 (2–12 mm/1st hour). His biochemistry revealed an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 342 (30–300 iu/L), bilirubin 15 (3–17 μmol/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 45 (3–35 iu/L), aspartate transaminase (AST) 42 (3–35 iu/L), corrected calcium 2.82 (2.12–2.65 mmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 782 (iu/L). Renal function was normal.
An Ultrasound of the hip revealed a moderate right sided joint effusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and hips (figure ) confirmed the effusion with marked soft tissue swelling and synovial thickening. There was oedema in the proximal femur.
Our working diagnosis was septic arthritis, with tuberculosis of the hip as a differential, in view of his past medical history. He was thus managed accordingly with a washout and commenced on chemotherapy. Microbiology of the synovial fluid revealed no organisms; auramine tests were repeatedly negative, as was syphilis serology, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis and melioidosis.
There was little clinical response to treatment and inflammatory markers 2 weeks after admission were elevated at a CRP of 130 and ESR of 114.
He then developed an episode of diarrhoea and vomiting as an inpatient. Initial investigations for amoeba, cysts, ova, parasites were all negative. Colonoscopy was undertaken and revealed a stricture in the sigmoid colon. Multiple biopsies revealed a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma on histological examination. An immunohistochemical panel showed the tissue to be cytokeratin 20 (CK-20) positive, cytokeratin 7 (CK-7) negative and villin negative, thus in keeping with a colorectal primary tumour. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was measured at 100.7. Genetic screening and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing on the tumour were negative.
The synovial fluid was re-examined for cytology following the histological diagnosis and this confirmed a malignant joint effusion.
A computerised tomogram (CT) revealed multiple para-aortic lymph nodes, with no evidence of metastases other solid organs. A bone scan (figure ) revealed high uptake areas in the skull vault, spine, ribs, pelvis, proximal ends of both femurs and sternum; all in keeping with widespread metastatic disease.
In view of the advanced nature of the adenocarcinoma the primary tumour was not resected and he was commenced on Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 (day one of cycle) and Capecitabine 1.25 g/m2 (twice daily for fourteen days) for a planned eight cycles (each cycle of twenty-one days). He responded well initially with an improvement symptomatically after 2 cycles of chemotherapy, and objectively on computerised tomogram (CT) of his abdomen and pelvis with reduction in the size and number of significant lymph nodes.

She had three previous abdominal operations including a prophylactic colectomy in 1992. In 1995, she had a resection of small intestine and marginal resection of associated desmoid tumors causing small bowel obstruction. In 2002, an emergent resection of small intestine and desmoid tumors for intestinal perforation removed only a portion of the diffuse mesenteric disease. This operation was complicated by an enterocutaneous fistula from the jejunum that subsequently healed with conservative care. She had no adjuvant radiation therapy at any point. Estrogen and progesterone receptor expression of the tumors was never assessed.
Despite treatment with anti-inflammatory agents, the patient's abdominal desmoid tumors continued to grow and she was re-admitted 10 months later for recurrence of her enterocutaneous fistula. Radiographic studies showed near-complete small bowel obstruction by desmoid tumor (Figure , ) and complete diversion of the fecal stream through the fistula. She began total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The fistula was not amenable to operative repair without resolution of the distal small bowel obstruction. Options for resolving the distal obstruction included operative resection of the desmoids, a procedure associated with much potential morbidity, or systemic therapy to reduce the size of the desmoids. The patient was offered therapy with anti-estrogen agents or investigational therapy with imatinib. Imatinib was initiated and was ineffective, possibly related to the patient's difficulty with gut absorption. Imatinib was discontinued, and she began a regimen of cytotoxic therapy that is active for sarcoma, including doxorubicin 20 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2, and 3 and ifosfamide 2 g/m2 daily for 3 days of a 21 day cycle. She received five cycles of this regimen, with a clear radiographic response on CT scan (Figures , ). However, her high-output fistula continued.
A barium enema (Figure ) demonstrated resolution of the distal obstruction with reflux of contrast through the fistula. Enterocutaneous fistula resection with primary enteroenterostomy was performed without complication. The patient was discharged on TPN for continued nutritional support, although she was able to tolerate oral feedings with normal bowel function. Her midline surgical wound subsequently healed by secondary intent. With the return of gastrointestinal function, antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen 20 mg po daily was initiated.","[[40.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['enterocutaneous', 'abdominal', 'small intestine', 'marginal', 'small bowel', 'small intestine', 'intestinal', 'mesenteric', 'enterocutaneous', 'jejunum', 'abdominal', 'enterocutaneous', 'small bowel', 'fecal stream', 'fistula', 'fistula', 'distal small bowel', 'gut', 'fistula', 'Enterocutaneous fistula', 'bowel', 'gastrointestinal']","[""Gardner's Syndrome"", 'enterocutaneous fistula', 'desmoid tumors', 'desmoid tumors', 'small bowel obstruction', 'desmoid tumors', 'intestinal perforation', 'mesenteric disease', 'enterocutaneous fistula', 'abdominal desmoid tumors', 'enterocutaneous fistula', 'small bowel obstruction', 'desmoid tumor', 'complete diversion of the fecal stream through the fistula', 'distal small bowel obstruction', 'distal obstruction', 'desmoids', 'potential morbidity', 'reduce the size of the desmoids', 'ineffective', 'difficulty with gut absorption', 'sarcoma', 'clear radiographic response', 'high-output fistula', 'resolution of the distal obstruction', 'reflux of contrast through the fistula', 'complication', 'able to tolerate oral feedings', 'normal bowel function', 'midline surgical wound', 'return of gastrointestinal function']","['imatinib', 'Imatinib', 'Imatinib', 'doxorubicin', 'ifosfamide', 'tamoxifen']","['40', 'Gardner', '1992', '1995', '2002']","['prophylactic colectomy', 'abdominal operations', 'prophylactic colectomy', 'resection of small intestine', 'marginal resection', 'emergent resection of small intestine', 'operation', 'conservative care', 'adjuvant radiation therapy', 'Estrogen and progesterone receptor expression of the tumors', 'anti-inflammatory agents', 'Radiographic studies', 'total parenteral nutrition', 'TPN', 'operative repair', 'operative resection of the desmoids', 'procedure', 'systemic therapy', 'therapy', 'anti-estrogen agents', 'investigational therapy', 'cytotoxic therapy', 'regimen', 'CT scan', 'barium enema', 'Enterocutaneous fistula resection', 'primary enteroenterostomy', 'TPN', 'nutritional support', 'antiestrogen therapy']","['status post', '1992', '10 months later']"

Case report,"A 38-year-old male, a heavy smoker, was admitted to our department, because of fever (38.4°C), weakness, arthralgias, non-pitting edema of the lower extremities and chest discomfort for the previous two weeks. The arthralgias were partially responsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient also reported skin eruptions on his elbows and lower extremities that had appeared six months previously. His past medical history was unremarkable.
On physical examination, sharply demarcated erythematous plaques covered by silvery white scales were observed on the right elbow and the lower extremities below the knees (figure ). The patient's ankles were painful and edematous. On palpation, firm and painless subcutaneous nodules could be found on the occipital part of the scalp. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
Basic laboratory tests were normal except for an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (57 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (45.2 mg/l). Further investigations, which included serum complement analysis, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmatic antibodies, immunoglobulin levels, and serological tests for hepatitis A, B and C and human immunodeficiency virus, disclosed no apparent pathologies. PPD skin test was negative. Neither arterial blood gases nor pulmonary function tests showed significant abnormalities. Radiographic examination, using x-ray and high resolution computed tomography of the chest, revealed bilateral hilar and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy with small nodules along the bronchovascular bundles. Fiber-optic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed. BAL fluid analysis revealed lymphocytosis (35%) with an increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio (4.2). Microbiological and cytological examinations were negative. Transbronchial lung biopsies were non-diagnostic.
A labial biopsy and biopsies from the cutaneous lesions were also obtained. The labial biopsy demonstrated the presence of small epithelioid (sarcoid form) granulomas (figure ), while the skin biopsies were typical of psoriasis (figure ). Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue samples with periodic acid-Schiff staining was negative. We concluded that the patient suffered from two separate clinical entities: pulmonary sarcoidosis and psoriasis vulgaris.
The articular manifestations responded partially to NSAIDs. Consequently, a short course of 30 mg prednisone daily and topical therapy to manage the psoriatic lesions were applied. This resulted in a significant clinical improvement.

In the following days, these symptoms worsened. The patient developed chest pain, tachycardia, dyspnea, and fever increasing in severity. She was unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. A detailed past medical history revealed that she had no risk factors, but had been diagnosed with BD 2 years before with recurrent oral and genital aphthous, pseudofolliculitis, and erythema nodosum in the lower extremities. Colchicine therapy had been started, but after a while the patient stopped the therapy on her own. Physical examination upon admission revealed a fever of 38.5°C. She also had oral ulcers on the lips, hypopigmented genital scars, and pseudofolliculitis. Heart sounds and bilateral lung areas were normal upon auscultation. Laboratory tests were consistent with an inflammatory condition with a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 130 mm in the first hour, a C reactive protein level of 78.3 mg/dl (normal range 0–5 mg/dl), a hemoglobin value of 11 g/dl and a leukocyte count of 5400/mm3 with a normal differential count. Urinalysis, and liver and kidney function were normal; antinuclear antibody tests were negative ; platelet count, protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III levels were within normal limits ; and anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant were absent. Her plasma total homocysteine level was 17 μmol/l (normal < 10 μmol/l). Chest radiography and electrocardiogram were normal with the exception of sinus tachycardia. Color Doppler echography and abdominal computed tomographic scan (CT) revealed an ascending thrombosis of the iliac and right ovarian veins (Figs. and ). Chest helical CT revealed a bilateral mural thrombus of segmental pulmonary arteries and a triangular area of opacity representing a pulmonary infarct at the posterior segment of the right lower lobe.

Her general and systemic examinations were unremarkable. There was no lymphadenopathy or hepato-splenomegaly. Her hemoglobin was 12.5 gm/dl, white blood cell (WBC) count was 7700/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 50 mm/hour and random blood sugar (RBS) was 96 mg/dl. Renal and liver function tests were normal. VDRL, HIV and HBsAg were non-reactive. Chest X-ray, ultrasound scan of the abdomen, upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy, peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy were normal. There was no past history of diabetes mellitus, hypo or hyperglycemic episodes. Biopsy and histopathological examination of the tonsillar mass was consistent with Non Hodgkin's lymphoma-diffuse large B cell type. Immunohistochemistry showed the tumor cells to be CD20 positive. She was treated using R-CHOP (rituximab 375 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 + doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 + vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 + prednisolone 100 mg orally) chemotherapy on a three weekly schedule after obtaining informed consent. About 24 hours following rituximab, she developed hypoglycemic symptoms like fatigue, restlessness, sweating and drowsiness. There was no other rituximab infusion related toxicities. Her RBS at that time was 39 mg/dl. Her symptoms subsided following intravenous (IV) glucose administration and RBS became normal. During the next 48 hours, she developed three more symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes, with RBS nadir 54 mg/dl, 61 mg/dl and 70 mg/dl respectively and were managed with IV glucose administration. Three days after rituximab her hypoglycemic symptoms subsided completely and the RBS improved to normal range.

A biopsy of the lesion showed deep inflammatory infiltration with macrophages containing numerous Leishmania amastigotes.
The patient, a farmer living in the rural area around Rome (Italy), was referred to our Institute. He had a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, suffered from asthma, and was given chronic corticosteroid (CS) therapy. The laboratory data on admission are reported in Table . Protein electrophoresis showed a mild hypergammaglobulinaemia. The immunofluorescence assay (Diamedix Corporation®, Miami-Florida) for the detection of anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies was positive (1:640). The search for antibodies against HIV resulted negative. A bone marrow aspirate did not show Leishmania amastigotes and a restriction fragment lenght polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RFLP) [] for the search of Leishmania DNA on bone marrow and peripheral blood resulted negative. L. infantum was identified by PCR-RFLP on the tongue biopsy.

She lived in the rural area around Rome (Italy) and had been taking CS and myorelaxants for 16 years because of myasthenia gravis. In the year 2000, the patient was treated for visceral leishmaniasis with bone marrow involvement. A course of liposomal amphotericin B (1 mg/kg daily for 10 days) was repeated one year later for a relapse with involvement of bone marrow and duodenum: a clinical remission of fever and diarrhea was obtained.
On admission to our Institute, the patient was taking prednisone 25 mg daily and pyridostigmine 60 mg four times daily. She was febrile (38.5°C) with an impaired nutritional status (35 Kg) and a severe muscular hypotrophy. Upon examination, a first trigeminal branch herpes zoster, and mild hepatomegaly were found; the left nostril presented a cutaneous squamous and crusty lesion that had appeared 4 months earlier.
The results of hematochemical assays are shown in table ; particularly, a severe lymphopenia (lymphocytes 538/mm3) with 215 CD4+ lymphocytes/mm3 and 132 CD8+/mm3 was found. HIV antibody test was negative. The chest X-rays showed an evolution from a single right basal consolidation to multiple bilateral pneumonic foci. The anti-Leishmania infantum serologic titer was 1:640 and the bone marrow biopsy showed numerous amastigotes of Leishmania spp. Intra-macrophagic amastigotes were also seen at histologic examination of the nasal lesion. L. infantum was identified by PCR-RFLP on peripheral blood and on nasal lesions. The patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg daily for 10 days, total 30 mg/kg), and with levofloxacin (500 mg daily for 10 days), obtaining clinical remission with a gradual improvement of the nasal lesion. No relapse was reported during a 9-month follow-up.
A 54-year-old male, a farmer living in the rural area around Grosseto, Tuscany (Italy), was admitted to our Institute in March 2004 with a relapse of visceral and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. In 1997 he complained of edema of the lips with maculopapular, non-itching lesions: a Miescher's granulomatous cheilitis was diagnosed and he was treated with local and systemic CS courses. The lesions of the perioral region disappeared, unlike the lips edema. In April 2003, he was admitted to a community hospital with remittent fever (40°C) associated to increasing asthenia and normocytic anemia. Amastigotes of Leishmania were recognized in the bone marrow and lip biopsies. The patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg daily i.v. on days 1–5, 14 and 21, total 21 mg/kg). The fever disappeared and the edema of the lips substantially decreased. However, few weeks after the end of the therapy febrile episodes recurred, and in December 2003 a new course of amphotericin B therapy was prescribed (liposomal amphotericin B, 5 mg/kg daily i.v. for 10 days). Clinical improvement with persistent detection of L. infantum PCR-RFLP on peripheral blood was observed.
On admission to our Institute the patient was febrile (39°C) and presented lips edema with erythematous and cutaneous squamous lesions, diffuse lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. The results of blood tests are shown in the table . The patient experienced a progressive reduction of hemoglobin (8.5 g/dL) and received two whole blood transfusions. Multiple blood cultures, HIV and Parvo virus B19 antibody searches were all negative. The anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies were positive (1:640), while the PCR-RFLP on peripheral blood resulted negative. The patient was treated with two subsequent 28-day courses of meglumine antimonate (20 mg/kg daily): he experienced a rapid clinical improvement and no adverse reactions. After a 6-month follow-up the patient is still in good condition, although a modest lip edema still remains. The antibody titer for Leishmania infantum is 1:160. The PCR for Leishmania spp. on peripheral blood is negative.

639,1764883-1,17150092,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1764883.xml,Secretory breast carcinoma with metastatic sentinel lymph node,"A 33-year-old woman with no family history of breast carcinoma presented with a nodule in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast wich had been discovered about four mounth previously and had gradually increased slightly in volume during the intervening period. Clinical examination showed the presence of a hard, mobile, non-painful nodule with regular margins, a smooth surface and about 1,5 cm in diameter. No clinical alterations were found either in the ipsi- or contralateral lymph nodes. Ultrasound examination of the breast showed an ovular hypoechogenic formation with regular margins and 1,5 cm in diameter, diagnosable as a fibroadenoma of the breast.
Not only for this reason, but also following the patient's specific request, core biopsy of the tumour was not performed and the patient therefore immediately underwent surgical removal of the nodule under local anaesthetic. The histopathological examination of the surgical piece showed the presence of a secretory carcinoma the lesion had no capsule, since one of the resection margins was not very clear, and showed small, glistening, mucus-like foci on the cut surface.
For microscopic examination, 5 micron sections were obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded material and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Alcian PAS. The lesion showed solid cell nests, intermingled with tubular structures and separated by fibrous bundles. The neoplastic nests consisted of small, uniform, well-differentiated cells, with granular or vacuolated cytoplasm and vescicular nuclei containing small nucleoli. Mitoses were scanty and atypia was mild. Eosinophilic, PAS-positive secretory material was frequently observed in the ductular lumina and, in the form of globular structures, in the intracytoplasmic vacuoles of many neoplastic cells (fig ). Peripherally, in the more ductular areas, extracellular Alcian blue-positive material (reminiscent of a mucinous carcinoma) was present. Vascular invasion was not evident. Immunohistochemically the neoplastic cells showed a strong positive stain for cytokeratins (MNF116, CK7) EMA, S100 (fig ) and e-cadherin (fig ). In addition, an extremely focal, weak stain for 34beta E12 and CD10 was observed.
Chromogranin, sinaptophysin, NSE, smooth muscle actin, p63, Her-2, oestrogen and progesterone receptors were negative, Mib1 (Ki67) and P53 were positive in less than 5% of the cells. The histological diagnosis was G1 secretory breast cancer.
Analysis of the DNA cell content of the secretory carcinoma proves to be diploid with low proliferative activity [-] and, in fact, in our own case, flow cytometry performed on the cell DNA (65,520 cells) also showed a diploid-type histogram (DI = 1.0) with low proliferative activity (S-phase = 4.5%).
After an interdepartmental discussion, an upper outer quadrantectomy of the right breast on the previous site of removal of the nodule was proposed to the patient, together with a biopsy of the ipsilateral axillary sentinel lymph node.
The sentinel lymph node was identified with the use of a radiocolloid and intravital stain.
The day before the operation, the sentinel lymph node was observed by means of lymphoscintigraphy after an intradermal injection into the surgical scar of human albumin (Nanocoll) bound to technetium 99 (0,2 mCi of 99 mTc in a volume di 0,4 ml). Ten minutes before the start of the operation 0.5 ml of intravital stain was injected subdermically into the same site. A portable radioisotope detector was a further help in the intraoperative identification of the sentinel lymph node, which showed up as bright blue and was therefore removable without any difficulty. Frozen section of the sentinel nodes was not performed since at the time when this case was observed (1999) the extemporary histological examination of the sentinel lymph node was not well-codified in our department and was therefore not in routine use.
The subsequent histological analysis performed on the removed quadrant showed the presence of some small areas of ""in situ"" secretory carcinoma, mixed with focal aspects of ductal papillomatosis with atypia of the epithelial cells.
The lymph node defined as the sentinel had a maximum diameter of 1 cm. It was fixed in formalin, paraffin-embedded, completely sectioned and histologically analysed. It presented metastases with a maximum diameter of 0,3 cm (fig ); the metastatic cancer cells showed intracytoplasmic vacuoles containing secretory globules similar to those of the primary tumour cells (Fig )
A total axillary lymphoadectomy under general anaesthetic was therefore performed during a subsequent operation. Histological examination of the 18 axillary lymph nodes removed showed no signs of metastases. The patient was given adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of six cycles of CMF and radiotherapy of the residual mammary gland.
Periodic follow-up examinations after completion of the surgical, medical and radiotherapy treatment have shown no evidence of either local regression or distant metastases and seven years later, the patient is still free of the disease.","[[33.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['breast', 'upper outer quadrant of the right breast', 'ipsi- or contralateral lymph nodes', 'breast', 'ovular', 'breast', 'cut surface', 'ductular lumina', 'globular structures', 'intracytoplasmic vacuoles', 'ductular areas', 'Vascular', 'breast', 'right breast', 'site of removal of the nodule', 'ipsilateral axillary sentinel lymph node', 'sentinel lymph node', 'lymph node', 'subdermically', 'site', 'sentinel lymph node', 'lymph node', 'sentinel nodes', 'sentinel lymph node', 'quadrant', 'ductal', 'lymph node', 'axillary', '18 axillary lymph nodes', 'residual mammary gland']","['breast carcinoma', 'nodule', 'nodule', 'regular margins', 'clinical alterations', 'ovular hypoechogenic formation', 'regular margins', 'fibroadenoma of the breast', 'tumour', 'nodule', 'secretory carcinoma', 'lesion', 'capsule', 'one of the resection margins was not very clear', 'foci', 'lesion', 'solid cell nests', 'intermingled with tubular structures', 'neoplastic nests', 'granular or vacuolated cytoplasm', 'vescicular nuclei', 'nucleoli', 'Mitoses', 'atypia', 'Eosinophilic', 'PAS-positive secretory material', 'neoplastic cells', 'extracellular Alcian blue-positive material', 'mucinous carcinoma', 'Vascular invasion', 'neoplastic cells', 'stain for 34beta E12 and CD10', 'secretory breast cancer', 'secretory carcinoma', 'diploid-type histogram', 'low proliferative activity', 'nodule', 'sentinel lymph node', 'sentinel lymph node', 'surgical scar', 'sentinel lymph node', 'secretory carcinoma', 'focal aspects of ductal papillomatosis', 'atypia of the epithelial cells', 'sentinel', 'metastases', 'metastatic cancer cells', 'intracytoplasmic vacuoles', 'secretory globules', 'primary tumour cells', 'metastases', 'local regression', 'distant metastases', 'disease']","['human albumin', 'Nanocoll']","['33', '1999']","['Clinical examination', 'Ultrasound examination of the breast', 'core biopsy of the tumour', 'surgical removal of the nodule under local anaesthetic', 'histopathological examination of the surgical piece', 'microscopic examination', 'Immunohistochemically', 'stain for cytokeratins (MNF116, CK7) EMA, S100 (fig ) and e-cadherin (fig )', 'e-cadherin', 'Chromogranin', 'sinaptophysin', 'NSE', 'smooth muscle actin', 'p63', 'Her-2', 'oestrogen and progesterone receptors', 'Mib1 (Ki67)', 'P53', 'Analysis of the DNA cell content of the secretory carcinoma', 'flow cytometry', 'upper outer quadrantectomy of the right breast on the previous site', 'upper outer quadrantectomy of the right breast on the previous site of removal of the nodule', 'biopsy of the ipsilateral axillary sentinel lymph node', 'radiocolloid', 'radiocolloid and intravital stain', 'intravital stain', 'lymphoscintigraphy', '0.5 ml of intravital stain was injected subdermically into the same site', 'portable radioisotope detector', 'Frozen section of the sentinel nodes', 'extemporary histological examination of the sentinel lymph node', 'histological analysis', 'fixed in formalin, paraffin-embedded, completely sectioned', 'histologically analysed', 'total axillary lymphoadectomy', 'general anaesthetic', 'Histological examination', 'Histological examination of the 18 axillary lymph nodes removed', '18 axillary lymph nodes removed', 'adjuvant chemotherapy', 'CMF', 'radiotherapy', 'examinations', 'surgical, medical and radiotherapy treatment', 'medical and radiotherapy treatment']","['during the intervening period', 'seven years later']"

The patient was retired after various occupations; he had also worked for 7 years at the local port and for 3 years in a motor factory, but he had no memory of direct exposure to asbestos. He had no smoking history. Medical history included partial gastric resection due to gastric and duodenal ulcers with concomitant cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis at 44, surgical removal of a renal stone at 74, diagnosis of benign prostatic hypertrophy at 76.
A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed the presence of a large mass occupying the epigastrium and the left upper region of the abdomen (longest diameter: 9 cm), and multiple diffuse abdominal nodules along the peritoneal surface and below the anterior abdominal wall (longest diameter: 5 cm); imaging confirmed the presence of bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. A small amount of ascites was present; liver, spleen and kidneys were spared. Chest CT was negative, with no evidence of pleural or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. An excisional biopsy of the left inguinal lymphadenopathy was performed. Histological analysis showed malignant neoplasm with a micropapillary, microcystic, and solid growth pattern infiltrating the adjacent soft tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive staining of tumour cells for cytokeratins 5 and 7, vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), epithelial specific antigen (ESA), calretinin; no reactivity was observed for carcinoembryonic antigen or Tag/B72.3. Histological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with a well differentiated biphasic malignancy of mesothelial origin.
In July 2004 the patient was referred to our Department for management. At admission, he reported progressive clinical deterioration (Karnofsky Performance Status 80), fatigue, unintentional weight loss of 6 kg and persistent fever over the last few weeks. His medications were terazosine and finasteride. Physical examination showed a subcutaneous epi-mesogastric mass (9 × 6 cm) and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Complete blood count showed haemoglobin 11.6 g/dL, platelet count 559,000 per cubic millimeter, and white cell count 8,400 per cubic millimeter, with a normal differential count; renal function and liver function tests were normal.
In consideration of patient's age, and type and stage of disease, palliative chemotherapy with single-agent pemetrexed at 500 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks was proposed []. Pemetrexed was provided by Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN) within an Expanded Access Programme. Before chemotherapy start, a written informed consent was obtained and a repeat CT was performed, showing a size increase of all lesions (longest diameter of the mass in the abdominal left upper region: 12 cm) (Fig. ). Treatment started in early August 2004. During the treatment, the patient received vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation, and steroid prophylaxis []. After the first 2 cycles, a clinical improvement was observed with reduction of frequency and intensity of febrile episodes. Partial response was documented by physical examination (decrease in size of the subcutaneous abdominal mass and bilateral inguinal nodes) and by CT (decrease in size of all known lesions and no new lesions). Treatment was well tolerated with only grade 2 neutropenia, and grade 2 nausea and anorexia. Therefore, pemetrexed was continued for 3 cycles and further tumour shrinkage was documented at physical examination and imaging. Toxicity persisted acceptable with only grade 2 nausea and fatigue; fever disappeared after the third cycle. Three further cycles of pemetrexed were administered without increase in toxicity except for mild fever lasting few days after drug administration. After a total of 8 cycles, the epi-mesogastric mass and the inguinal bilateral lymphadenopathy were no more detectable at physical examination, whereas abdominal CT in April 2005 showed a minimal residue of disease (Fig. ). His Karnofsky Performance Status was 80 and his weight was increased of approximately 10% since treatment start. At that point, after multidisciplinary evaluation and discussion with the patient about therapeutic options, we decided to stop the treatment.
In August 2005, a follow-up CT revealed the reappearance of nodular peritoneal lesions. Due to the significant benefit observed and the duration of response (11 months) the patient was retreated with pemetrexed for 4 cycles from August to November 2005, resulting in disease stabilization.

The crossed-head tip of the screwdriver pierced into the right maxilla and the steel shank penetrated through the skull base. The total penetration trajectory measured roughly ten centimeters. The patient was admitted in GCS 11. He presented a scotoma in the left eye and a CSF leak in the maxillary area. The 3-D CT-scan revealed an oblique trajectory of the screwdriver through the right maxilla, into the ethmoidal plane and as far as the left sphenoid wing (Fig. ).
An emergency left pterional approach surgery was performed. The tip of the screwdriver was lodged just above the left optic nerve and adhered tightly to the intracranial part of the nerve trunk. The tip was detected in the left Sylvian area next to the M1 narrowed tract.
First, the screwdriver tip was carefully detached from the artery and, then, the screwdriver was slowly extracted from the skull base. The dura lacerations were repaired with artificial dura, while the skull base fractures were closed with a fragment of temporal muscle and fibrin glue.
The post-operative course was uneventful.

Three weeks before referral to our endocrinological surgery unit she developed a swelling of her head and neck lymph nodes. Her past medical history included surgical removal of a benign breast tumor 22 years ago. Her family history was unremarkable regarding any endocrinological or thyroid disease. Besides her obesity she was suffering from reflux disease and hypertension. She had a regular pulse of 68/per minute and blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg under antihypertensive medication. Her muscle tone was reduced. She had observed a change of her voice and had lost 20 kg of weight within the past 4 months. A thyroid scintigram showed multiple confluencing cold nodules which were highly suspicious for malignant neoplasm of both thyroid lobes and regional lymph node metastases along both jugular veins. Clinical exam and sonography showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes of the head and neck. Pre-operative serum calcitonin was 5.3 pg/ml (normal range 0.8–9.9 pg/ml). Based on the history, clinical presentation and the scintigram we suspected an anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and performed a radical oncologic thyroidectomy with bilateral modified neck-dissection and resection of the right internal jugular vein and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Intraoperatively the tumor was tightly adherent to the surface of the trachea. Because of the impressing clinical picture a fine needle aspiration was not performed prior to surgery. In the authors' point of view it would have had no prognostic effect at this advanced stage of disease. A pre-operative pentagastrin test was also not performed as clinical presentation made the presence of an anaplastic carcinoma highly suspicious. Surprisingly, histopathology showed a pT3 L1 V1 R1 N1b low-differentiated medullary-thyroid carcinoma with massive lymphangiosis and haemangiosis carcinomatosa. Immunhistochemistry revealed weak positive staining for calcitonin and carcinoembryogenic antigen (CEA) (Figure ). Post-operative serum calcitonin decreased to 2.47 pg/ml still being within normal range (0.8–9.9 pg/ml). Post operatively the patient was in the intensive care unit for 6 days. A pentagastrin stimulation test was not performed due to the bad condition of the patient. A permanent tracheostoma was established to ensure a patent airway as the patient aspirated after initial extubation. Additionally massive crust formation obstructed the patient's airway which was treated with a humidifier and frequent irrigations with physiological saline solution and subsequent suctioning of the trachea. Unfortunately the patient developed central lung emboli in the right pulmonary artery. A postoperative CT scan showed multiple lung and intracerebral metastases (Figure and Figure ).

Everything had started a year before, when he had developed shortness of breath along with a plethoric face. The patient was admitted to the Surgery Department and was diagnosed with SVC thrombosis by means of Doppler ultrasonography and spiral computed tomography (CT) scan of chest (figure ). The subject underwent thoracotomy out of suspicion of mediastinal mass effect on SVC, detected on thoracic spiral CT scan to be a thymoma or a thymus-associated mass. In the operation, no discrete mass was found and the thymus gland was removed and sent for pathologic review. No pathologic finding was detected and the gland had normal histological appearance. The patient received anticoagulant therapy in the form of warfarin 5 mg/day for 9 months. Then, he developed arthralgia of knee, wrist, elbow and ankles but no documented arthritis. He was examined by a rheumatologist when he was discovered to have positive pathergy test (positive cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction to intradermal injection of saline) and an oral aphthous ulcer. The history of genital ulcer was also positive in the patient. The diagnosis of Behcet's disease was made and the patient was treated with prednisolone tablets, 15 mg/day, and azathioprine, 100 mg/day; warfarin was also continued. A follow-up CT scan showed prominent mediastinal collateral veins close to the esophagus (figure ).
Two weeks later, the patient presented with sudden onset of hematemesis and was admitted to the Emergency Room. He did not mention any past history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Review of systems was not contributory. The patient was conscious and agitated. His blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, but he had orthostatic hypotension with resting heart rate of 104/min. The patient had plethoric face and engorgement of jugular vein. Conjunctivae were pale and sclerae were anicteric. Pemberton's sign was detected; i.e. within 30 seconds after raised both arms simultaneously (Pemberton's maneuver), marked facial plethora (Pemberton's sign) developed, indicating compression of the jugular vein. Abdomen was soft with no tenderness, organomegaly or shifting dullness. Nervous system, musculoskeletal system, joints and the peripheral vascular system were all normal. A nasogastric tube was inserted and coffee ground secretions were revealed. Lab data were as follows: WBC: 6400, Hb: 6.5 g/dl, MCV: 97, MCH: 32, Platelet: 241,000, PTT: 40 seconds, PT: 18 seconds, INR: 2.1, albumin: 4 g/dl, ALT: 23, Alkaline Phosphatase: 170 (normal), BUN: 18 mg/dl, Cr: 0.6 mg/dl, Na: 138 meq/dl, K: 4.2 meq/dl.
The patient received 6 fresh frozen plasma (FFP) units and 4 units of packed red cells and his INR was rechecked after FFP infusion, when it was corrected to 1.3.
Because of underlying vasculitis, the diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis and bleeding due to esophageal varices was considered. The patient received intravenous infusion of octreotide and intravenous infusion of ranitidine. The bleeding stopped and the patient was closely monitored in the Emergency Room. Warfarin and azathioprine were discontinued and intravenous hydrocortisone was started instead of oral prednisolone. The patient underwent upper endoscopy on the day of admission and esophageal varices were found. Gastric and duodenal mucosae were intact. Abdominal ultrasound was normal and no evidence of ascites, splenomegaly and chronic liver disease was found. To rule out portal vein thrombosis as the cause of esophageal varices, Doppler ultrasonography was performed and mesenteric, splenic, portal and hepatic veins were evaluated; no discrete thrombosis was detected. He was not able to perform MR angiography because of his economic status. The patient underwent re-endoscopy by a second endoscopist and red color sign or stigma of recent bleeding plus esophageal varices were found in the upper half of esophagus tapering to the middle part of esophagus (figure ); the diagnosis of ""downhill"" esophageal varices was made and band ligation was performed successfully (figure ). He received oral cyclophosphamide 100 mg/day upon recommendation of rheumatologist. Omeprazole was administered too.
The patient was discharged from hospital the following day without any complication. Two weeks later, the third endoscopy along with the second band ligation was performed. He was discharged without any further episodes of bleeding. After 1 and 6 months, the patient underwent the 4th and 5th endoscopies and ""downhill"" esophageal varices were found to have been eradicated. Warfarin was initiated for patient and he has been well with no bleeding during the past 16 months.

The swelling had increased in size since then to occupy almost whole of the abdomen. Right labia had a swelling which increases in size on standing and decrease on lying down. On examination abdomen was found to be distended, felt tense with flanks full. The swelling over the labia was reducible on manipulation suggesting its continuity with the abdominal swelling.
Ultrasound abdomen showed 30 × 20 × 20 centimeters huge, multiloculated, multiseptate, lesion extending from xiphisternum to pelvis with extension into the right labia majora. Lesion was causing lateral and posterior displacement of bowel loops and compression of liver and both kidneys. A provisional diagnosis of omental, mesenteric or ovarian cyst was made. CT scan was done to throw some more light on the site of origin. Non-contrast film showed the cyst filled with clear fluid possibly arising from the mesentery. Contrast film was suggestive of multiloculated cyst. Pelvic films proved the labial extention of the cyst (See Figure ), but still the exact site of origin remained unclear.
Patient was taken up for exploratory laparotomy and midline vertical incision was kept. After opening the peritoneum a thin walled cyst was seen popping out of the skin incision (See Figure ). On exploration it was found attached to the greater omentum (See Figure ).
Cyst was deflated partially by aspiration and we found the swelling over labia majora got reduced as we deflated the cyst and no adhesions were found between the cyst wall and labia. Complete excision of the cyst wall along with part of omentum was done. Histopathological report of the cyst wall showed endothelial cell lining, foam cells, lymphatic spaces, lymphoid tissue and smooth muscles which are diagnostic of lymphangiomatous cyst (See Figure ).

Clinical and radiographic examination (including 3D DVT scan [digital volume tomography, New Tom 9000, New Tom Marburg, Germany]) revealed an edentulous moderately severe atrophied mandible, a partialy edentulous maxilla, with severe posterior maxillary alveolar atrophy and skelettal class-III conditions due to cleft palate (figures and ).
In March 2004 extraction of the teeth 12, 17, 22, bilaterally sinus lifting procedure and a simultaneous alveolar ridge augmentation of the maxilla and the mandible were peformed under general anaesthesia. A mixture of cancellous bone from the iliac crest and Grafton®-DBM-Putty (Osteotech, Eatontown, NJ, USA) was used for the maxillary sinus floor augmentation. The lateral augmentation was performed using screw fixed autogenous corticocancellous block grafts and particulate bone grafts from the iliac crest mixed with Grafton®-DBM-Putty (Osteotech, Eatontown, NJ, USA). To fulfill the patient's desire the teeth 11 and 21 were left in the maxilla.
After three months screws were removed and auxiliary implants placed in the mandible.
6 weeks later screws were removed from the maxilla and using preoperative fabricated surgical guides a total of 12 endosseous Camlog® implants were accurately positioned in the mandible and the maxilla according to the predefined planning that was made up of DVT scan and a wax up. Again bone augmentation around the dental implants was performed using filter collected bone and a bioresorbable collagen membrane (BioMend Extend®, Zimmer Dental, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Based on the ideal implant position temporary protheses were fabricated and used for performing the modell-operation to correct the maxillo-mandibular relation. Three months later Le Fort I osteotomy with high horizontal bone cut was performed under general anaesthesia. The carefully downfractured maxilla allowed an unique view from above to the grafted sinuses (figure ). The grafted bone showed high consistency and stability and except for a small mucocele in the right sinus no signs of any inflammatory irritation were detected. According to the preoperative planning the maxilla was placed in the new advanced position and then fixed with microplates (figure ).
Postoperative healing was uneventful, except for a local infection that occurred two month later in the left upper canine region therefore the implant there had to be removed.
Six month later after extraction of teeth 11 and 21 the miniplates were removed from the maxilla and the implants uncovered. In addition abutments with protective healing caps were installed. After placing definite abutments and removing the auxililary implants final restauration was placed (figure ).","[[46.0, 'year']]",M,2007,"['palate', 'mandible', 'maxilla', 'posterior maxillary alveolar', 'skelettal', 'palate', 'teeth 12, 17, 22', 'bilaterally sinus', 'alveolar ridge', 'maxilla', 'mandible', 'cancellous bone', 'cancellous bone from the iliac crest', 'iliac crest', 'maxillary sinus floor', 'bone', 'iliac crest', 'teeth 11 and 21', 'maxilla', 'mandible', 'maxilla', 'mandible', 'maxilla', 'bone', 'dental', 'bone', 'collagen membrane', 'maxillo-mandibular', 'bone', 'maxilla', 'grafted sinuses', 'grafted bone', 'right sinus', 'maxilla', 'left upper canine region', 'teeth 11 and 21', 'maxilla', 'auxililary']","['cleft palate', 'other serious diseases', 'loose fitting denture', 'atrophied mandible', 'edentulous maxilla', 'posterior maxillary alveolar atrophy', 'cleft palate', 'downfractured maxilla', 'high consistency and stability', 'mucocele', 'inflammatory irritation', 'healing was uneventful', 'local infection']",[],"['46', 'departement', 'Tom', '9000', 'Tom Marburg', 'Germany', 'March 2004']","['prosthetic treatment', 'radiographic examination', '3D DVT scan', 'digital volume tomography', 'extraction', 'extraction of the teeth 12, 17, 22', 'bilaterally sinus lifting procedure', 'alveolar ridge augmentation of the maxilla and the mandible', 'general anaesthesia', 'mixture of cancellous bone from the iliac crest and Grafton®-DBM-Putty (Osteotech, Eatontown, NJ, USA) was used for the maxillary sinus floor augmentation', 'lateral augmentation was performed using screw fixed autogenous corticocancellous block grafts and particulate bone grafts from the iliac crest mixed with Grafton®-DBM', 'particulate bone grafts from the iliac crest mixed with Grafton®-DBM-Putty', 'teeth 11 and 21 were left in the maxilla', 'screws were removed', 'auxiliary implants placed in the mandible', 'screws were removed from the maxilla', '12 endosseous Camlog® implants were accurately positioned in the mandible and the maxilla', 'DVT scan', 'wax up.', 'wax up.', 'bone augmentation around the dental implants was performed using filter collected bone and a bioresorbable collagen membrane', 'temporary protheses were fabricated', 'modell-operation to correct the maxillo-mandibular relation', 'Le Fort I osteotomy with high horizontal bone cut was performed under general anaesthesia', 'maxilla was placed in the new advanced position', 'maxilla was placed in the new advanced position and then fixed with microplates', 'implant there had to be removed', 'extraction of teeth 11 and 21', 'miniplates were removed from the maxilla', 'implants uncovered', 'abutments with protective healing caps were installed', 'placing definite abutments', 'removing the auxililary implants', 'final restauration was placed']","['March 2004', 'March 2004', 'After three months', 'three months', '6 weeks later', 'Three months later', 'Postoperative', 'Six month later']"

Preoperative investigations revealed a white cell count (WCC) of 15.6 × 109/L (neutrophils 10.1 × 109/L, monocytes 2.5 × 109/L) and urinalysis positive for blood. He denied any urinary or respiratory symptoms but was treated empirically for a lower urinary tract infection and discharged home. Urine culture was negative. Two weeks later, the WCC remained elevated at 14.2 × 109/L (neutrophils 10.5 × 109/L, monocytes 1.6 × 109/L), although he remained asymptomatic and was keen to proceed.
Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed using the left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time was 76 minutes with aortic cross-clamp for 39 minutes, using antegrade cold crystalloid cardioplegia. The patient came off CPB easily and remained haemodynamically stable thereafter. He was extubated expeditiously and returned to the ward on the first postoperative day. Routine blood tests demonstrated a leukocytosis (46.9 × 109/L) with marked neutrophilia (38.5 × 109/L) and monocytosis (8.4 × 109/L).
Late on the first postoperative day, his condition deteriorated with progressive hypoxia, oliguria and metabolic acidosis. He was readmitted to the intensive care unit for non-invasive ventilation and inotropic support. On the morning of the second postoperative day, he remained hypoxic and oliguric. A pulmonary artery catheter revealed low cardiac output state and low systemic vascular resistance. He was reintubated and mechanically ventilated, inotropic therapy was increased and continuous veno-venous haemofiltration and broad-spectrum antibiotics were commenced. A cardiac origin of low cardiac output was excluded and sepsis or splanchnic ischemia were considered as causes of his systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multi-organ dysfunction (MOD). Computed tomography of the thorax and abdomen showed bilateral ground glass shadowing of the lung parenchyma consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome but no other significant findings. The leukocytosis increased to 91.7 × 109/L (neutrophils 54.1 × 109/L, monocytes 33.0 × 109/L) and his condition deteriorated. A haematology opinion was sought and confirmed a diagnosis of probable leukaemoid reaction on a background of CMML. Despite maximal therapy, the patient died on the third postoperative day. Post-mortem findings were of an enlarged spleen and widespread SIRS, manifesting as pulmonary congestion with patchy hemorrhagic necrosis of the small and large bowel.","[[70.0, 'year']]",M,2007,"['coronary', 'three vessel', 'left ventricular', 'urinary', 'respiratory', 'lower urinary tract', 'Coronary artery', 'left internal mammary artery', 'saphenous vein', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'aortic', 'pulmonary artery', 'cardiac', 'cardiac origin', 'cardiac', 'splanchnic', 'thorax', 'abdomen', 'lung parenchyma', 'respiratory', 'spleen', 'pulmonary', 'small and large bowel']","['angina', 'three vessel disease', 'good left ventricular function', 'well', 'blood', 'symptoms', 'lower urinary tract infection', 'asymptomatic', 'haemodynamically stable', 'leukocytosis', 'condition deteriorated', 'hypoxia', 'oliguria', 'metabolic acidosis', 'hypoxic', 'oliguric', 'low cardiac output state', 'low systemic vascular resistance', 'low cardiac output', 'sepsis', 'splanchnic ischemia', 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome', 'SIRS', 'multi-organ dysfunction', 'MOD', 'bilateral ground glass shadowing of the lung parenchyma', 'acute respiratory distress syndrome', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'significant findings', 'condition deteriorated', 'leukaemoid reaction', 'CMML', 'died', 'enlarged spleen', 'SIRS', 'pulmonary congestion', 'hemorrhagic necrosis']",[],"['70', 'ward', 'intensive care unit']","['coronary revascularization', 'physical examination', 'Preoperative risk assessment scores', 'EuroSCORE', 'logistic', 'white cell count', 'WCC', 'neutrophils', 'monocytes', 'urinalysis', 'Urine culture', 'WCC', 'neutrophils', 'monocytes', 'Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed using the left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts', 'Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)', 'aortic cross-clamp', 'antegrade cold crystalloid cardioplegia', 'CPB', 'extubated', 'blood tests', 'leukocytosis', 'neutrophilia', 'monocytosis', 'non-invasive ventilation', 'inotropic support', 'pulmonary artery catheter', 'reintubated', 'mechanically ventilated', 'inotropic therapy', 'veno-venous haemofiltration', 'broad-spectrum antibiotics', 'Computed tomography of the thorax and abdomen', 'leukocytosis', 'neutrophils', 'monocytes', 'maximal therapy']","['Two weeks later', 'third postoperative day']"
648,1774568-1,17204160,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1774568.xml,Psychogenic or neurogenic origin of agrammatism and foreign accent syndrome in a bipolar patient: a case report,"FG is a 74-year-old right-handed man. He has a grade eleven education and worked as an auxiliary nurse. He had suffered from a chronic bipolar disease since 1982, with multiple episodes requiring many hospitalizations. He came to our attention in July 2005 for acute exacerbation of a bipolar disorder with suspected psychotic features requiring inpatient treatment. At admission, symptoms were compatible with manic exacerbation. Psychotic features were not confirmed. Mental status examination revealed signs of his primary psychiatric disorder. Moreover, a foreign accent, English-sounding, was noted. FG had learned to deal with this long-lasting symptom so he did not report it spontaneously. However, on explicit questioning, he reported that this accent was socially invalidating and completely impossible to control or repress. FG is a native speaker of Quebec French but people who met him thought he came from somewhere else, most often Acadia (French-speaking areas of Eastern Canada (New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia) where the accent is markedly different from Quebec French), France or an English-speaking foreign country. Apart from this foreign accent, he also reported some German- or Spanish-sounding words occasionally and spontaneously coming to his mind. No meaning is associated with these words and the patient easily controls their occurrence with no anxiety. Neurological examination completed during the index hospitalization was unremarkable except for an observed inability to turn back on one foot (decomposition of the half-turn) when walking, slight incoordination of the left arm on the cerebellar testing, and slight micrographia. Snout and palmomental primitive reflexes were also noted.
FG's past medical records reported the presence of this foreign accent in January 2003. It was first noticed at the psychiatric outpatient clinic consultation, shortly after he was discharged from the inpatient service, which was required for manic exacerbation of his bipolar disorder in the fall of 2002. The presence of agrammatism was also recorded during the same period. Psychological factors were suspected because of the patient's psychosocial background (abuse by his father and emotional closeness to his mother, who was English-speaking). Even though he was exposed to English as a child, he never spoke or learned this language. Without any other neurological symptoms, his psychiatrist ascribed the foreign accent to a psychological phenomenon operating at an unconscious level.
His neurological history is noteworthy for epilepsy between the ages of 6 and 14 but without any other symptomatic seizures thereafter. He also suffered from delirium due to lithium intoxication 6 months before the onset of the foreign accent. Finally he has been treated for an essential tremor for many years and has neurosensory hypoacusia. Otherwise, there was no prior history of stroke, cranial trauma or encephalitis. When he developed the language disorder, he was on stable doses of lithium, valproate, quetiapine and perphenazine.
Although they appeared approximately 3 years earlier, the functional origin of the FAS and agrammatism was explored in FG through an extensive neuropsychological and brain imaging study.
Neuropsychological testing showed no impairment in tasks exploring orientation to time and space. FG's performance was normal on the task exploring concentration and selective attention []. He showed good face recognition and presented no clinical signs of visual agnosia []. There were no signs of unilateral neglect. Praxis abilities were well preserved []. FG performed normally on tasks exploring episodic memory. His performance was within the normal range for the three recalls of the DMS-48, a visual forced-choice recognition test [], as well as for the pictorial recognition memory test and the short recognition memory test for faces []. The patient's short term memory was normal in the visuospatial modality (forward span = 5; backward span = 4) []as well as in the verbal modality (forward digit span = 4; backward digit span = 3; forward word span = 4). FG presented with deficits on tests exploring working memory and executive functions. He presented with a severe impairment on the interference condition of the Brown-Peterson task [], a test that taps the ability to encode, maintain, and manipulate information in working memory (see Table ). His performance on the Stroop Test [], an instrument designed to evaluate inhibition abilities (i.e. inhibition of a habitual or more automatic response in favour of an unusual one), was influenced by interference. He obtained normal scores in the word reading and colour naming but his performance was impaired in the colour-word conditions. FG also showed abnormal performance on the Trail Making [], a test exploring mental flexibility (ability to manage more than one stimulus at a time and to shift the course of an ongoing activity). He made no mistakes but was slow on part A and his performance was poor on Part B (alternated switching between numbers and letters). Finally, FG's performance was impaired (2 SD below the normal range) on the D-Kefs Tower Test [], a complex task that measures the executive functions of spatial planning, rule learning, and inhibition of impulsive responding.
With regard to language, speech output was fluent and well articulated, with no signs of word-finding difficulties. The patient however presented with mild agrammatism. There were no phonemic or verbal paraphasias but speech was sometimes telegraphic with omissions of function words and grammatical bound morphemes as well as impoverished syntactic structure. Auditory and visuo-verbal input components were largely preserved. Comprehension abilities at the lexical-semantic level [] as well as at the syntactic-semantic level [,] were normal (see Table ). Reading and immediate and delayed repetition were flawless for both words and nonwords. Written spelling of nonwords was flawless but the patient's performance on word writing to dictation was canonical of surface agraphia with exclusive production of phonological plausible errors and performance affected by orthographic regularity and lexical frequency. However, the patient did not completely master the written language so that these results cannot be interpreted as actual deficits. FG's performance was normal in confrontation naming [] but he showed difficulties in letter and semantic category fluency tasks [] (see Table ), a performance that could be attributed to the deficit in executive functioning. FG showed many characteristics usually reported for FAS. There were no signs of dysarthria (no slow, slurred, groping or laboured articulation) or apraxia of speech (no dysfluency and no problems with phoneme sequencing) but acoustic analysis performed on speech samples recorded in Digital Audio Tape showed the presence of abnormalities at the segmental and suprasegmental levels. Unfortunately, we had no premorbid recording of the patient's speech. However, FG himself as well as one of his close friends, who has known him for over 30 years, confirmed that he never had this particular strange accent before its sudden appearance in January 2003.
Neuroimaging studies were performed while the patient was in euthymic condition. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study including sagittal FLAIR and T2-weighted sequences and axial FLAIR, proton density, T1 and T2-weighted sequences was performed on December 8, 2005 using the standard protocol. The first interpretation was normal except for slight diffuse cerebral atrophy considered normal for his age (see Figure : serie 3 31/10 = axial T2-weighted sequence showing diffuse cortical atrophy predominating at the left sylvian fissure).
An 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose brain positron emission tomography was obtained with a dual-head coincidence camera (Vertex MCD-AC, Phillips). After a 30-minute rest, 111 MBq 18F-FDG were injected in a veinous catheter. There was another 30-minute rest before starting the acquisition (64 × 64 × 16 matrix, 64 steps, mean of 25 seconds/step with decay correction). Measured attenuation and scatter correction were applied to the iterative reconstruction method.
The reconstructed images showed diffuse hypometabolism in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes bilaterally whereas the cerebellum, occipital lobe and subcortical structures were spared. There was also a focal deficit in the area of the anterior left temporal lobe with prominence of the sylvian sulcus (see Figure ). When compared to the MRI, these deficits were related to asymmetric atrophy, which was retrospectively seen in the left temporal and frontal opercular/insular region without a focal lesion.","[[74.0, 'year']]",M,2007,"['Mental status', 'psychiatric', 'Neurological', 'foot', 'left arm', 'cerebellar', 'neurological', 'neurological', 'neurosensory', 'cranial', 'brain', 'face', 'faces', 'segmental and suprasegmental levels', 'cerebral', 'cortical', 'left sylvian fissure', 'brain', 'head', 'frontal, parietal and temporal lobes', 'cerebellum', 'occipital lobe', 'subcortical structures', 'area of the anterior left temporal lobe', 'sylvian sulcus', 'left temporal', 'frontal opercular', 'insular region']","['bipolar disease', 'bipolar disorder', 'psychotic features', 'symptoms', 'manic exacerbation', 'Psychotic features', 'primary psychiatric disorder', 'foreign accent', 'English-sounding', 'symptom', 'accent', 'German- or Spanish-sounding words', 'meaning is associated with these words', 'anxiety', 'unremarkable', 'inability to turn back on one foot', 'decomposition of the half-turn', 'incoordination of the left arm', 'micrographia', 'reflexes', 'foreign accent', 'manic exacerbation of his bipolar disorder', 'agrammatism', 'Psychological factors', 'abuse', 'neurological symptoms', 'epilepsy', 'seizures', 'delirium', 'lithium intoxication', 'foreign accent', 'essential tremor', 'neurosensory hypoacusia', 'stroke', 'cranial trauma', 'encephalitis', 'language disorder', 'functional origin of the FAS', 'agrammatism', 'impairment in tasks exploring orientation to time and space', 'good face recognition', 'visual agnosia', 'unilateral neglect', 'Praxis abilities', 'Praxis abilities were well preserved', 'FG performed normally on tasks exploring episodic memory', 'performance was within the normal range', 'short term memory was normal', 'short term memory was normal in the visuospatial modality', 'deficits', 'impairment on the interference condition of the Brown-Peterson task', 'normal scores in the word reading and colour naming', 'impaired in the colour-word conditions', 'abnormal performance', 'ability to manage more than one stimulus at a time', 'shift the course of an ongoing activity', 'mistakes', 'slow on part A', 'performance was poor on Part B', 'alternated switching between numbers and letters', ""FG's performance was impaired"", 'speech output was fluent and well articulated', 'word-finding difficulties', 'agrammatism', 'phonemic or verbal paraphasias', 'speech was sometimes telegraphic', 'omissions of function words', 'grammatical bound morphemes', 'impoverished syntactic structure', 'Auditory and visuo-verbal input components were largely preserved', 'Comprehension abilities at the lexical-semantic level [] as well as at the syntactic-semantic level [,] were normal', 'Reading and immediate and delayed repetition were flawless for both words and nonwords', 'Written spelling of nonwords was flawless', 'word writing to dictation was canonical of surface agraphia', 'exclusive production of phonological plausible errors', 'performance affected by orthographic regularity and lexical frequency', 'not completely master the written language', 'deficits', ""FG's performance was normal in confrontation naming"", 'normal in confrontation naming', 'difficulties in letter and semantic category fluency tasks', 'deficit in executive functioning', 'dysarthria', 'slow', 'slurred', 'groping', 'laboured articulation', 'apraxia of speech', 'dysfluency', 'problems with phoneme sequencing', 'abnormalities', ""premorbid recording of the patient's speech"", 'particular strange accent', 'strange accent', 'euthymic condition', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cortical atrophy', 'hypometabolism', 'spared', 'focal deficit', 'prominence of the sylvian sulcus', 'deficits', 'asymmetric atrophy', 'focal lesion']","['lithium', 'valproate', 'quetiapine', 'perphenazine', '18F-FDG']","['FG', '74', 'auxiliary nurse', '1982', 'July 2005', 'Acadia', 'Eastern Canada', 'New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island', 'Nova Scotia', 'France', 'January 2003', 'psychiatric outpatient clinic', 'inpatient service', 'fall', '2002', '6', '14', 'January 2003', 'December 8, 2005']","['inpatient treatment', 'cerebellar testing', 'FG', 'extensive neuropsychological and brain imaging study', 'Neuropsychological testing', 'FG', 'three recalls of the DMS-48', 'visual forced-choice recognition test', 'pictorial recognition memory test', 'short recognition memory test for faces', 'working memory and executive functions', 'Brown-Peterson task', 'Stroop Test', 'word reading and colour naming', 'FG', 'Trail Making', 'mental flexibility', 'FG', 'D-Kefs Tower Test', 'FG', 'FG', 'acoustic analysis', 'Neuroimaging studies', 'magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study', 'brain positron emission tomography', 'MRI']","['since 1982', 'July 2005', 'January 2003', 'fall of 2002', 'same period', '6 months', 'many years', 'January 2003', 'January 2003', 'December 8, 2005']"

He also had a large, firm, mobile lump on his left thigh.
He had been treated six years previously for prostatic carcinoma which was Gleason's grade 3+3= 6. Bony metastases had been diagnosed recently. He was on Zoladex® injections.
Clinical examination showed a 6 cm hard, mobile, non-tender mass in his right iliac fossa. Digital rectal examination was unremarkable. Rigid sigmoidoscopy revealed radiation proctitis, which would explain his bleeding per rectum. CT scan of abdomen showed a caecal tumour with regional lymphadenopathy and vertebral metastasis (Figure ). A non-palpable left iliac mass was identified: this was defined as internal iliac nodes lymphadenopathy, associated with partial obstruction of the left ureter (the possibility of prostatic metastasis to these nodes was considered). A fatty mass lesion was identified in the left thigh, the CT appearances of which were that of a simple lipoma; this has remained unchanged on subsequent CT scans. Bone scan confirmed bony metastasis in the 12th thoracic and 1st lumbar vertebrae and rib cage. In 2003, there was a gradual rise in his PSA levels which had gone upto 233 nmol/ml. Zoladex® injections were then started and his PSA levels fell to 6.3 nmol/ml by January 2004. This however had gradually risen again to 254.4 nmol/ml on admission, inspite of being on Zoladex®.
The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy for what appeared to be an obvious locally advanced luminally protuberant caecal carcinoma with mesenteric lymph nodal involvement. Histopathological examination of the specimen showed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the caecum extending throughout the whole bowel wall and breaching the serosa with metastatic involvement of 5 of 15 paracolic lymph nodes (Figure ). The possibility of prostatic metastasis was considered and confirmed on immunohistochemical staining for PSA (Figure ) and, given this, stains for CK7, CK20 and CDX2 immunoprofile were considered unnecessary. The final histological diagnosis was of a metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma to the caecum.

Chest and abdominal computed tomography showed a 7.8 × 7.3 cm irregular, partially cystic mass in the body and tail of the pancreas, suspicious for malignancy. In addition, two lesions were seen in the liver compatible with metastases. He underwent an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), which revealed a 4.9 × 3.7 cm irregular mass in the pancreatic tail and body. The mass was hypoechoic, heterogeneous, lobulated, multicystic, and septated. There were two masses found in the left lobe and in the perihilar region of the liver, measuring 1.9 × 1.5 cm and 2.2 × 2.2 cm in maximal cross-sectional diameter respectively. Fine needle aspiration was performed on one of the two masses in the left lobe of the liver, after color Doppler imaging was utilized prior to needle puncture in order to confirm a lack of significant vascular structures within the needle path (Figure: ). Three passes were made by a 22-gauge needle with a stylet using a transgastric approach. A cytopathologist (HQP) was present and performed a preliminary cytological assessment during the procedure. An adequate sample was obtained after the first two passes but a third pass was requested for special studies due to the unusual morphology seen on site evaluation. The decision to not sample the pancreatic mass was made by the endoscopist.
Two passes were used for 2 sets of Air-Dried smears. One smear of each pass was stained on-site by the Diff-Quick method for immediate assessment.

A Case Report and Review of the Literature","A 48-year old Caucasian female with active
rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed with a low-grade myxoid
liposarcoma of the left thigh in 1981. This was treated with surgery followed by
radiotherapy. In 1991, she was discharged from routine oncological
followup. In 1998, she was rereferred by her GP for investigation
of a left groin mass. Biopsy of the groin mass confirmed recurrent
liposarcoma and restaging investigations confirmed that the lesion
was isolated. Surgery and radiotherapy (5000 Gy in 25
fractions) were used to treat the recurrent liposarcoma. The
pathology report revealed that the tumour had transformed into a
“high-grade myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma surrounding the iliac
artery and vein, involving the deep resection
margins.”
Over the next 6 years, the patient continued on close outpatient
followup with regular chest X rays. During this time, persistent
left leg oedema became problematic. In addition, her rheumatoid
arthritis remained symptomatic despite treatment with
hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, and indomethacin.
In October 2004, the patient was admitted as a
medical emergency with a 5-day history of nausea and vomiting,
severe occipital headache, photophobia, and diplopia. In
addition, she described a strange sensation in her tongue with
impaired tongue movement. On examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm smooth mobile cervical neck node was noted in
addition to a left VI cranial nerve palsy, a right XII
cranial nerve pals, y and hypotonia of the left side of the
tongue. A lumbar puncture, CT brain, and blood tests including a
vasculitic screen and viral serology were normal. An MRI
demonstrated a “high signal at apex of the temporal bone” but
was otherwise normal. Over the next 10 days, the patient
continued to complain of a persistent dull throbbing headache and
developed a right-sided VI nerve palsy. FNA of the neck node
confirmed metastatic liposarcoma and a CT scan of the
chest/abdomen and pelvis revealed “widespread tumour deposits in
the right psoas muscle and pelvis.” The lungs were clear of
metastatic disease. A repeat MRI done 3 weeks following her
admission this time showed that “at the skull base, the clivus
gives an abnormal marrow signal with infiltration, most likely due
to metastatic disease.” Due to intractable symptoms, she went on
to receive palliative radiotherapy to the base of skull (30 Gy
in 10 fractions). A repeat CT scan done 6 weeks after the last
scan showed progressive disease in the abdomen and pelvis with new
lung metastases. Whilst waiting to commence palliative
chemotherapy, the patient developed neurogenic dysphagia and died
from aspiration pneumonia. At postmortem, meningeal thickening was
noted in the area of the mid brain (). Further
neuropathological examination revealed liposarcoma cells within
blood vessels in the subarachnoid space () in
addition to deposits of metastatic liposarcoma in the subarachnoid
space itself ().","[[48.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['left thigh', 'left groin', 'groin', 'chest', 'left leg', 'occipital', 'tongue', 'tongue', 'cervical neck', 'cervical neck node', 'left VI cranial nerve', 'right XII\ncranial nerve', 'left side of the\ntongue', 'lumbar', 'brain', 'right-sided VI nerve', 'neck node', 'chest/abdomen', 'pelvis', 'lungs', 'skull base', 'clivus', 'marrow', 'base of skull', 'abdomen', 'pelvis', 'lung', 'meningeal', 'area of the mid brain', 'blood vessels', 'blood vessels in the subarachnoid space', 'subarachnoid space', 'subarachnoid\nspace']","['rheumatoid arthritis', 'myxoid\nliposarcoma of the left thigh', 'left groin mass', 'groin mass', 'liposarcoma', 'lesion', 'liposarcoma', 'tumour', 'myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma surrounding the iliac\nartery and vein', 'left leg oedema', 'rheumatoid\narthritis', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'occipital headache', 'photophobia', 'diplopia', 'strange sensation', 'impaired tongue movement', 'mobile cervical neck node', 'left VI cranial nerve palsy', 'right XII\ncranial nerve pals', 'hypotonia of the left side of the\ntongue', 'headache', 'right-sided VI nerve palsy', 'metastatic liposarcoma', 'tumour deposits', 'lungs were clear of\nmetastatic disease', 'abnormal marrow signal', 'infiltration', 'metastatic disease', 'symptoms', 'disease', 'lung metastases', 'neurogenic dysphagia', 'died', 'aspiration pneumonia', 'meningeal thickening', 'liposarcoma cells', 'metastatic liposarcoma']","['hydroxychloroquine', 'methotrexate', 'indomethacin']","['48-year', '1981', '1991', '1998', 'October 2004']","['surgery', 'radiotherapy', 'Biopsy of the groin mass', 'Surgery', 'radiotherapy', 'pathology', 'chest X rays', 'treatment', 'lumbar puncture', 'CT brain', 'blood tests', 'vasculitic screen', 'viral serology', 'MRI', 'FNA of the neck node', 'CT scan of the\nchest/abdomen and pelvis', 'MRI', 'palliative radiotherapy', 'palliative radiotherapy to the base of skull', 'CT scan', 'scan', 'palliative\nchemotherapy', 'neuropathological examination']","['1981', 'next 6 years', '5-day', '5-day', 'next 10 days', '3 weeks', '6 weeks']"

urinary tract infection caused by Photobacterium damsela,
a virulent pathogen, in a 22-year-old gravid female at 23-week
gestation.
The patient initially presented for routine prenatal care. At this
time she reported frequency and dysuria with no other complaints.
She denied any significant past medical history. The only finding
on physical examination was suprapubic tenderness and leukocytosis
was noted on the urine dipstick. A urine culture was obtained and
the patient was treated empirically with Cephalexin 500 mg qid
for one week. The urine culture subsequently demonstrated growth
> 100000 colonies of Photobacterium damsela, which was
sensitive to cephalosporins,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and aminoglycosides.
Given the rarity of infection with this
pathogen, a more detailed history was obtained where the patient
stated have had sexual intercoursein the Caribbean Sea off the
coast of Puerto Rico, one week prior to her office visit.
One week after having her first office visit and the urine culture
with the above findings, the patient presented to labor and
delivery complaining of fever, chills, and foul smelling urine at
24-week gestation. On the day prior to admission, she noted that
her urine was malodorous. She complained of suprapubic tenderness
and mild right flank pain. On examination she was noted to have an
oral temperature of 101.6 and suprapubic tenderness, no
costovertebral angle tenderness was noted. No contractions were
palpated and on vaginal examination a closed uneffaced cervical os
was noted. The white blood cell count was 8800 with 79%
polymorphonuclear lymphocytes and no bandemia was present.
A urinalysis showed trace blood, positive nitrites, and some
bacteria. The fetal heart rate was reassuring and no contractions
were noted on the tocometer.
Given the history of the unusual pathogen that grew a week prior
to this presentation, the patient was admitted with the diagnosis
of pyelonephritis in pregnancy and was started on Cefazolin
2 g IV every 6 hours, and Gentamicin 120 mg IV every 8
hours. The patient remained febrile for 24 hours at which time she
had her last temperature spike of 101.6 and fetal tachycardia
was noted to 180 beats per minute. She was maintained on the
aforementioned antibiotic therapy and defervesced. A complete
blood count was repeated on hospital admission day number 3 and
her white blood cell count remained within normal limits. On
admission day 3 the peak and trough for gentamicin showed
therapeutic levels of the antibiotic. No growth was observed on
the blood cultures done on admission. The patient was discharged
home on hospital day number five. She was advised to take Bactrim
for one week followed by suppressive therapy with Macrobid for the
remainder of the pregnancy. Urine cultures were repeated monthly
for the next 3 months and all remained negative.","[[22.0, 'year']]",F,2006,"['urinary tract', 'suprapubic', 'suprapubic', 'right flank', 'oral', 'suprapubic', 'costovertebral angle', 'vaginal', 'cervical os', 'heart']","['urinary tract infection', 'Photobacterium damsela', 'virulent pathogen', 'gravid', 'gestation', 'frequency', 'dysuria', 'other complaints', 'suprapubic tenderness', 'leukocytosis', 'Photobacterium damsela', 'infection', 'pathogen', 'sexual intercoursein', 'labor', 'delivery', 'fever', 'chills', 'foul smelling urine', 'gestation', 'urine was malodorous', 'suprapubic tenderness', 'right flank pain', 'suprapubic tenderness', 'costovertebral angle tenderness', 'contractions', 'closed uneffaced cervical os', 'bandemia', 'blood', 'bacteria', 'contractions', 'unusual pathogen', 'pyelonephritis', 'pregnancy', 'febrile', 'fetal tachycardia', 'defervesced', 'therapeutic levels of the antibiotic', 'growth', 'pregnancy']","['Cephalexin', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'aminoglycosides', 'Cefazolin', 'Gentamicin', 'gentamicin', 'Bactrim', 'Macrobid']","['22', 'Caribbean Sea', 'coast of Puerto Rico']","['prenatal care', 'physical examination', 'urine dipstick', 'urine culture', 'urine culture', 'cephalosporins', 'urine culture', 'oral temperature', 'white blood cell count', 'polymorphonuclear lymphocytes', 'urinalysis', 'nitrites', 'fetal heart rate', 'tocometer', 'temperature spike', 'antibiotic therapy', 'complete\nblood count', 'white blood cell count', 'peak and trough for gentamicin', 'blood cultures', 'suppressive therapy', 'Urine cultures']","['23-week', 'At this\ntime', 'At this\ntime', 'one week', 'prior to her office visit', '24-week', 'On the day prior to admission', 'a week prior\nto this presentation', '24 hours', 'next 3 months']"

(UM) Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility clinic for an
evaluation of a six year history of primary infertility. Her prior
fertility evaluation and treatment history was significant for
four previous cycles of ovulation augmentation with clomiphene
citrate in conjunction with timed intercourse and a normal
hysterosalpingogram several years earlier. Her initial workup at
UM revealed normal ovarian reserve testing, normal values for TSH
and prolactin, and her husband's semen analysis was normal.
Transvaginal ultrasonography showed persistent bilateral
3.5 cm ovarian cysts that had a ground-glass appearance
consistent with endometriomas []. The patient underwent
laparoscopic evaluation due to the large endometriomas at which
time she was diagnosed with stage IV endometriosis. Due to dense
adhesive disease, the procedure was converted to an
exploratory laparotomy. Three right
ovarian endometriomas were removed, and the cyst wall of each was
excised with subsequent cauterization of the bases for hemostasis.
The left ovarian endometrioma was approached; however, it was not
removed due to severe adhesions and the patient's desire for
fertility. The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable.
Five weeks after surgery, the patient underwent a
hysterosalpingogram which showed a normal uterine cavity, right
tubal patency, and left hydrosalpinx without spillage of dye. She
subsequently underwent two cycles of gonadotropins in conjunction
with intrauterine inseminations, but had suboptimal responses.
Nine months after surgery, the patient presented to
the emergency room with fever and abdominal pain. Her temperature
was 38.7°C. Her abdominal and pelvic exams showed
moderate tenderness, small amount of vaginal discharge and
bacterial vaginosis as evidenced by clue cells on a normal saline
wet prep. Gonorrhoeae and chlamydia cultures were obtained.
Transvaginal ultrasound showed a 7 cm left adnexal mass with
uniform echogenicity (). Her WBC was
16.7 K. She was admitted to the hospital for intravenous
antibiotic administration but despite broad-spectrum coverage,
high-grade fevers continued. On hospital day 3, after discussion
of risks, benefits, and alternatives that included conservative
management, she was consented for definitive surgical management
and underwent a modified radical hysterectomy with bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy and lysis of adhesions.
Although all cervical, blood, and urine cultures were negative
on hospital admission, the left ovary contained an ovarian abscess
with gram negative rods within the left-sided endometrioma.
Gonorrhoeae and chlamydia cultures were negative. There was an
evidence of BV on normal saline wet prep and culture. Histology of
the left fallopian tube and ovary revealed an endometriotic cyst
with massive edema, hemorrhage, acute inflammation, and marked
eosinophilia () with an associated pyosalpinx

654,1779773-1,17212820,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1779773.xml,Pneumatized superior turbinate as a cause of headache,"A 40-year-old female, non smoker was referred by her family physician with migraine-type headache complaints and mild nasal congestion. The pain was located over the forehead and behind the left eye. Headaches occurred once every 3 weeks, triggered by weather and barometric changes with mild improvement during the menstruation. The duration of the headache was 3 days approximately and the pain was not associated with nausea, photophobia, vertigo or tinnitus. Its intensity was 9 on a 0–10 visual analogue scale.
The patient reported nephrotic syndrome at the age of 3, for which she had been on prednizolone for 10 years. A history of recurrent episodes of rhinosinusitis was also obtained.
Nasal endoscopy revealed a mild septal deviation, a right concha bullosa of the middle turbinate and a paradoxically curved middle turbinate on the left side. Coronal computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the above findings and additionally revealed a superior concha bullosa and mild mucosal disease on the left side (Fig. ).
The patient underwent a detailed laboratory examination to exclude any other possible causes of headache. Whole blood cell count, urinalysis, thyroxin level, biochemical tests, tumor markers, as well as Mantoux test and monotest were normal. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, and ultrasonography of the thyroid gland were also normal. Biochemical and serologic tests of hepatic dysfunction were negative. Serologic tests of complement fixation titers of the plasma antibodies against various common viruses were performed and were found normal as well.
The patient underwent nasal rigid endoscopy after application of local anesthetic and decongestant, which revealed the presence of a large superior concha in close contact with the nasal septum (Fig. ). Direct application of local anesthetic (1% tetracaine hydrochloride solution) at the point of contact between the superior concha and the nasal septum improved headache by 4 points (score 5 at the scale of 0–10). Injection of local anesthetic (0.5 ml of 2% xylocaine with epinephrine 1:100.000) into the superior turbinate under endoscopic visualization eliminated the pain completely.
The patient was given endonasal steroids for 20 days without improvement. Then she was advised surgical intervention which she initially denied. The patient was followed for 3 months without any improvement and she, finally, decided to undergo surgery. Septoplasty and bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery was performed, including partial removal of both the pneumatized middle turbinates in conjunction with gentle lateralization and resection of the lower half of the left superior turbinate. The interior of the superior turbinate was found devoid of fluid or any other content. The patient reported prompt relief of her headache and at 13 months of follow-up postoperatively she remains free from headache or any other nasal symptoms. Although the patient did never report anosmia, she was examined by using the ""Sniffin' sticks"" test 1-year-postoperatively []. The examination showed that odor threshold, odor discrimination and odor identification were within normal limits. It appears, thus, that although part of the olfactory mucosa might had been removed by the partial resection of the superior turbinate, sufficient olfactory epithelium had remained intact, resulting in preservation of normal olfactory function.
Although pneumatization of the middle nasal turbinate has been occasionally reported [], pneumatization of the superior and inferior turbinates are very rare findings [,]. The presence of a superior concha bullosa is not always recognizable with nasal endoscopy alone, due to the minimally accessible area of the upper nasal cavity. For this reason, the superior nasal turbinate has been called the forgotten turbinate []. Coronal CT-scan provides useful information for this inaccessible area.
Association of a massive extensively pneumatized superior turbinate with headache is very rare. In these cases the superior turbinate is forced anteriorly and inferiorly at the area between the middle turbinate and the nasal septum, leading to intranasal mucosal contact []. Although the phenomenon of referred headache owed to intranasal mucosal contact was recognized as early as 1888 by Roe [] and has been since, occasionally, reported, with the advent of functional endoscopic sinus surgery and CT imaging, resurgence of interest in headache of nasal origin has been observed. Stammberger and Wolf [] reviewed the possible mechanisms involved in the genesis of referred headaches in the nasal area. According to them, afferent fibers from pain receptors in the nasal mucosa terminate in the same group of sensory neurons in the sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, as fibers innervating cutaneous receptors, located at several peripheral segmental dermatomes of the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve. These two common pathways converge along the same final neurons to a common area of the cortex. Accordingly, the cortical center can not distinguish the original peripheral source of the pain impulses and they may be misinterpreted as coming from other skin areas, such as the temple, the zygoma or the forehead. The pain may be perceived also from other end-organs innervated by terminal branches within the trigeminal system, such as dura, intracranial and scalp vessels or the eye [].
An important issue in the generation of headaches of nasal origin is mediation of neuropeptides, such as substance P [,,]. These may be released by mechanical pressure induced in areas of contacting opposing mucosal surfaces, such as the superior turbinate and the nasal septum. Substance P can be liberated at both the central and the peripheral ends of a sensory neuron, mediating not only central pain reflexes, via afferent C fibers, but at the same time local reflexes at the nasal mucosa, resulting from reverse impulses and manifestating as vasodilation, extravasation of plasma, hypersecretion, and smooth muscle contraction. This axon reflex can explain why an initial small localized lesion, such as a limited mucosal lesion or area of nasal mucosal contact, may trigger severe long-standing headaches, frequently projecting to different areas of the head.
Many areas of the nose and the paranasal sinuses have been implicated as causes of referred headaches, including superior concha bullosa as a rare occurrence. Clerico [] was the first who suggested the superior turbinate as a source of referred headache, with features consistent of common migraine. Two more reports on this issue followed [,]. Clerico [] proposed that before surgery, the application of local anesthetic and/or decongestant (diagnostic block) on the area of the superior turbinate, under endoscopic visualization, might confirm this anatomic variation as the source of headache. We performed this test, and although significant reduction of the pain was obtained, the pain was not completely eliminated. This was probably due to the fact that local decongestants and anesthetic sprays are deposited primarily in the anterior half of the nasal cavity and may not adequately reach the superior turbinate. Complete relief of headache was obtained only after injection of local anesthetic into the superior turbinate under endoscopic guidance. The positive finding of this diagnostic test and resolution of the symptoms after surgical intervention prove the association of our patient's headache with the presence of the massive superior concha bullosa.
Finally, the presence of a nasal osteoma as a rare cause of headaches of nasal origin should be mentioned. Paranasal sinus and intranasal osteomas are histologically benign and slow-growing tumors, which are usuallly asymptomatic, but when they enlarge they may produce pressure symptoms such as headaches. They occasionally cause obstruction or infection and may grow into the orbit or intradurally causing neurological manifestations. Paranasal sinus osteomas usually occur in the frontal sinus and less frequently in the other sinuses []. A few cases of intranasal osteomas were also reported, mainly in the middle turbinate and once in the superior turbinate []. All cases of turbinal osteomas were characterized by accompanying headache, probably due to the same pathogenetic mechanisms implicated in headache caused by the presence of a pneumatized superior concha, as previously mentioned. CT scan may assist in differential diagnosis by depicting the lesion and providing detailed information concerning the bony structures of the region.","[[40.0, 'year']]",F,2007,"['nasal', 'over the

656,1780052-1,17201913,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1780052.xml,Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) after thoracic radiotherapy for breast carcinoma,"A 59-year-old female who was a lifelong non-smoker underwent a modified radical mastectomy in August 2002 for an adenocarcinoma of her left breast, staged pT2N2M0. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 4 cycles of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) with cyclofosfamide (600 mg/m2) was administered from September to November 2002, followed by tamoxifen 20 mg daily. The patient was then referred for adjuvant radiotherapy on the left thoracic wall and the axillary lymph nodes. After CT planning, she received radiation from 6th February to 20th March 2003 to a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The thoracic wall was irradiated using tangential 6 Mv photon fields, and regional lymph nodes using an anterior-posterior photon field (6 Mv) dosed at 3 cm, with a posterior top-up field to the axilla. The V20, i.e. volume of total lung receiving a dose of 20 Gy or more, was 32%.
In April 2003, the patient complained of shortness of breath. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.0°C and pulmonary auscultation revealed inspiratory crackles and bronchial breathing sounds. Peripheral O2 saturation was 97% measured by a pulse-oxymeter during treatment with 2 litres of O2 a minute. Blood analysis revealed a CRP of 189 mg/L(0–10 mg/L) and a one-hour sedimentation rate of 105 mm/hour(0–30 mm/hour), haemoglobin was 5.4 mmol/L(7.5–10.0 mmol/L), WBC count was 6.0 × 109/L(4.4–10.0 × 109/L) with a slight eosinophilia of 12%(0–5%), platelet count was 365 × 109/L(150–400 × 109/L). Further serum chemistry, renal, liver functions, and urinalysis were normal. A chest radiograph showed a patchy consolidation zone in the upper lobe and the apex of the lower lobe of the left lung. Computer tomography (CT) revealed multiple ground glass opacities in the upper and lower lobe of the left lung, and no abnormalities were seen in the right lung.
A clinical diagnosis of radiation pneumonitis was made and treatment with prednisone 20 mg 3 times daily was initiated, with an improvement in clinical symptoms seen within 4 days. In the following months, the dose of prednisone was gradually tapered to 15 mg once daily. The chest radiograph in July 2003 showed a reduction of the ground glass opacities. In August 2003, patient was hospitalised due to shortness of breath. A new CT showed an increase of the patchy infiltrates in the left lung, but also new patchy infiltrates in the middle lobe of the right lung (figure ). To rule out an infectious cause, a bronchoscopy was performed which revealed no endobronchial abnormalities. No biopsies were performed but broncho-alveolair lavage showed a normal cell count and negative cultures. Consequently, a diagnosis of interstitial lung disease due to radiotherapy was made, most probably BOOP, and the prednisone dosage was increased to 20 mg four times daily. A clinical improvement was seen within two weeks, after which the prednisone dosage was tapered in the following 12 months. Radiological improvement was observed in the right lung (figure ). However, abnormalities consistent with radiation fibrosis remained within the radiation field in the left lung.
A 92-year-old patient presented with multiple intradermal metastases from a breast cancer on the right thoracic wall 10 years after undergoing an amputation of the right breast for a pT3N0M0 breast cancer. No adjuvant post-surgical therapy was administered after the initial surgery. Restaging revealed no regional or distant metastasis and the chest wall lesions were resected. Pathological examination showed an irradical resection after which she was referred for radiotherapy. She received thoracic and axillary radiotherapy to a total dose of 60 Gy in once-daily fractions of 2 Gy using non-CT based planning. Radiotherapy to 50 Gy was performed using an anterior electron field (10 MeV) matched to a lateral photon field (6 Mv) dosed at 3 cm. The dose on the axilla was supplemented using a posterior field. This was followed by a boost of 10 Gy to the site of irradical excision on the chest wall using 10 MeV electrons.
Three months after completing radiation therapy, the patient was hospitalised for complaints of fever and shortness of breath. She was febrile (38.0°C) and auscultation revealed bronchial breath sounds over the right lung while no abnormalities were heard on the left side. The one-hour sedimentation rate was 98 mm/hour(0–30 mm/hour), WBC count was 9.8 × 109/L(4.4–10.0 × 109/L). Chest radiograph showed a density of the right upper lobe and, to a lesser degree, the right lower lobe of the lung. The left lung showed a normal pattern. Bronchoscopy revealed no endobronchial abnormalities or evidence for infection. Bronchial biopsies showed normal tissue.
A diagnosis of radiation pneumonitis was made and high-dose prednisone 40 mg once daily was started. The clinical condition of patient improved significantly within two weeks and patient was discharged. During follow up, the improved clinical condition and radiological imaging lead to a tapering of the prednisone, with discontinuation after 6 months. The symptoms recurred two months later and a chest radiograph showed an increase in the density of the right lung and a density in the left upper lobe.

657,1780055-1,17227576,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1780055.xml,Brain metastases as primary manifestation of a melanocytic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in a 60-year-old man,"A 60-year-old man with mental retardation of unclear origin who was otherwise healthy suffered a focal seizure with speech disturbance. Two intracerebral lesions were identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure ).
The patient's neurological status on admission was normal. There were no clues to phakomatosis in the patient's or in the family history. Neither did the clinical findings point in this direction. No further seizures occurred after initiation and starting phenytoin therapy.
Initial MRI demonstrated a contrast-enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe and a smaller lesion in the right frontal lobe (Figure ). No other focal lesions were identified. Laboratory tests were normal except for elevations of the following parameters: D-dimer level of 254, neuron-specific enolase level of 13.1, and lambda and kappa light chain levels of 1.63 and 4.64, respectively. The CSF cell count and protein content were normal.
Since the lesions had no mass effect, initially a stereotactic biopsy was obtained from the left frontal lesion. Histologically, a semimalignant melanocytoma with the differential diagnosis of a MPNST was diagnosed. The lesion was then removed microneurosurgically. Postoperatively, the patient underwent whole-brain irradiation (30Gy). Due to the advanced stage of the malignancy and to gain control over further intracerebral metastasis, which were not visible on the MRI, no local radiotherapy such as radiosurgery was chosen. No postoperative or radiation-related complications were observed.
Fluorodeoxyglycose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) identified no body lesions except for an area of increased accumulation lateral to the right jugular vein, which corresponded to an enlarged lymph node, suggesting a nodal metastasis on MRI. PET even failed to demonstrate the right frontal lesion that was still present prior to cerebral irradiation. Only whole-body MRI (T2WI) identified several structures of increased signal intensity in the right thigh. One of the lesions was contiguous with the sciatic nerve (Figure and ). The radiologic criteria were indicative of a peripheral nerve tumor, suggesting that this was the primary tumor. Spinal MRI demonstrated further metastases at the level of S1 and S2 but no relationship to spinal nerves (Figure ).
Based on the patient's poor prognosis due to extensive local tumor spread and the presence of distant cerebral and vertebral metastases and a high risk of neurological deficits associated with a resection of the thigh tumors, a removal was considered unjustified. Stigmata of neurofibromatosis were excluded, as were pulmonary and visceral metastases.
The first follow-up examination was performed after 3 months. MRI identified no tumor recurrence in the left frontal lobe and no progression of the lesion on the right (Figure ). The patient had no clinical or neurological symptoms and suffered no seizures on continuous phenytoin medication (300 mg/day). At the last follow-up 11 months later, MRI showed unchanged cerebral findings and no progression of the lumbar vertebral lesions. However, there was an increase in the size of the cervical lymph node metastasis, and MRI for the first time demonstrated metastases in the area of the right thigh. Nevertheless, the patient continued to be free of neurologic deficits or epileptic seizures and no further therapy was initiated.
Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining demonstrated tumor tissue with spindled epithelioid cells, some of which contained melanin (Figure ). The cells were arranged in nestlike clusters with an altogether heterogeneous appearance. Immunohistochemically, strong expression of vimentin (dilution 1:600; Zymed, Wien/Austria) and S-100 (dilution 1:6000; DAKO, Glostrup/Denmark) was demonstrated (Figure ). The pigmented cells were positive for HMB45 (dilution 1:500; DAKO, Glostrup/Denmark) and there was isolated expression of EMA (dilution 1:100; DAKO, Glostrup/Denmark). The overall expression of Ki67 antigen (dilution 1:200; DAKO, Glostrup/Denmark) was low, but some foci with an index of 30% were identified. There was no immunoreaction to LU-5 (cytokeratin; dilution 1:500; Biomedicals, Augst/Switzerland), NF (neurofilament; dilution 1:200; Zymed, Wien/Austria), or SYN (synaptophysin; dilution 1:150; BioGenex; San Ramon/U.S.A.). Furthermore electron microscopy investigation showed a basal lamina, strongly indicating peripheral nerve origin. The histological diagnosis of MPNST was based on the demonstration of spindled cells and their arrangement, the pattern of immunoreactions as well as the electron microscopy investigation. Due to the overall low expression of the Ki67 antigen and the histological characterization, the tumor was graded WHO°I, according to the WHO classification for soft-tissue tumors[]. The histological diagnosis was verified by several reference pathologists.","[[60.0, 'year']]",M,2007,"['intracerebral', 'head', 'neurological', 'left frontal lobe', 'right frontal lobe', 'left frontal', 'whole-brain', 'intracerebral', 'body', 'lateral to the right jugular vein', 'lymph node', 'nodal', 'right frontal', 'cerebral', 'whole-body', 'right thigh', 'sciatic nerve', 'peripheral nerve', 'Spinal', 'level of S1 and S2', 'spinal nerves', 'cerebral', 'vertebral', 'neurological', 'thigh', 'pulmonary', 'visceral', 'left frontal lobe', 'neurological', 'cerebral', 'lumbar vertebral', 'cervical lymph node', 'area of the right thigh', 'neurologic', 'tissue', 'basal lamina', 'peripheral nerve origin', 'soft-tissue']","['mental retardation', 'healthy', 'focal seizure', 'speech disturbance', 'intracerebral lesions', 'phakomatosis', 'seizures', 'contrast-enhancing lesion', 'lesion', 'focal lesions', 'lesions', 'mass effect', 'left frontal lesion', 'melanocytoma', 'MPNST', 'lesion', 'malignancy', 'intracerebral metastasis', 'postoperative or radiation-related complications', 'body lesions', 'area of increased accumulation lateral to the right jugular vein', 'accumulation', 'enlarged lymph node', 'nodal metastasis', 'right frontal lesion', 'increased signal intensity', 'lesions', 'peripheral nerve tumor', 'primary tumor', 'metastases', 'poor prognosis', 'local tumor spread', 'metastases', 'neurological deficits', 'thigh tumors', 'neurofibromatosis', 'metastases', 'tumor', 'lesion', 'clinical or neurological symptoms', 'neurological symptoms', 'seizures', 'unchanged cerebral findings', 'lumbar vertebral lesions', 'cervical lymph node metastasis', 'metastases', 'neurologic deficits', 'epileptic seizures', 'tumor tissue', 'spindled epithelioid cells', 'cells were arranged in nestlike clusters', 'strong expression of vimentin', 'pigmented cells', 'isolated expression of EMA', 'foci', 'immunoreaction', 'MPNST', 'spindled cells', 'spindled cells and their arrangement', 'immunoreactions', 'tumor', 'soft-tissue tumors']","['phenytoin', 'vimentin', 'S-100', 'LU-5', 'cytokeratin', 'NF', 'neurofilament', 'Zymed', 'SYN', 'synaptophysin', 'BioGenex']","['60', 'Augst/Switzerland', 'Wien/Austria', 'San Ramon']","['magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head', 'phenytoin therapy', 'MRI', 'Laboratory tests', 'D-dimer level', 'neuron-specific enolase level', 'lambda', 'lambda and kappa light chain levels', 'CSF cell count', 'protein content', 'stereotactic biopsy', 'Histologically', 'lesion was then removed microneurosurgically', 'whole-brain irradiation', 'MRI', 'local radiotherapy', 'radiosurgery', 'Fluorodeoxyglycose positron emission tomography', 'FDG PET', 'MRI', 'PET', 'cerebral irradiation', 'whole-body MRI (T2WI)', 'Spinal MRI', 'resection of the thigh tumors', 'examination', 'MRI', 'MRI', 'MRI', 'therapy', 'Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining', 'Immunohistochemically', 'S-100', 'HMB45', 'Ki67 antigen', 'index', 'electron microscopy', 'electron microscopy', 'Ki67 antigen', 'histological characterization', 'histological diagnosis']","['Postoperatively', 'after 3 months', '11 months later']"
658,1780062-1,17194310,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1780062.xml,Case report: Infective endocarditis caused by Brevundimonas vesicularis,"The patient was a 40-year-old male admitted for chronic cough and a 2-month history of intermittent afternoon fever. He denied both a history of traveling and contact with animals over the previous 3 months. Associated symptoms included general malaise, anorexia, and the loss of 6 kg body weight within the previous 2 months. On admission, the vital signs were shown as blood pressure: 124/68 mmHg; pulse rate: 80/min; respiratory rate: 22/min; body temperature: 38.5°C. Physical examination revealed a pansystolic murmur over the apex and left lower sternal border. An abscess in a molar cavity that required debridement was found, although the patient had not complained of dental pain. Laboratory tests revealed a WBC count of 9250/μL with elevated neutrophils (82.7%); normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL; an elevated ESR level (123 mm/1 hr); and abnormal liver function with AST/ALT of 49/79 IU/L. A chest x-ray film revealed increased infiltration over the right upper and lower lobes, and abdominal sonography showed mild splenomegaly. Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was excluded by negative results from serial acid-fast stain and culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a vegetation with size of 0.9 cm over the anterior leaflet of mitral valve, and moderate mitral regurgitation. However, the cardiac systolic and diastolic functions were normal with the ejection fraction of 78.9%, fraction shortening of 47.8%. Ultimately, definite subacute endocarditis was diagnosed according to the Duke criteria, including two blood culture results of B. vesicularis; the presence of vegetation on the mitral valve revealed by an echocardiogram (Fig. ); and such clinical and laboratory features as fever, splenomegaly, heart murmur, anemia, Osler's node (Fig. ),,and Roth's spot (Fig. ).
The pathogen was identified as B. vesicularis on the basis of the biochemical characteristics tested by the API ID 32 GN automatic identification system (bioMérieux, Marcy I' Étoile, France). These included the characteristics of positive activity of D-maltose/D-glucose oxidation; negative activity of inositol/D-sorbitol/L-arabinose oxidation; negative activity of L-alanine/capric acid/potassium 5-ketogluconate/trisodium citrate decarboxylation; negative activity of nitrate reduction and indole production. The organism was susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, aztreonam, cefepime, meropenem, netilmicin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, cefazolin, cefmetazole, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ticarcillin, according to the susceptibility test performed by the disc diffusion method with interpretation criteria for Pseudomonas []. The patient was treated with a combination of cefazolin (2 gm/8 hr) and gentamicin (80 mg/8 hr) as empiric antibiotics during the first 3 days and fever subsided gradually.
Ampicillin/sulbactam (3 gm/6 hr) was used alternatively for covering the infection of oral anaerobes while the patient underwent removal of the abscessed tooth. Treatment with amipicillin/sulbactam failed, however; the patient developed a flare-up of fever, the appearance of a new Osler's node on the fourth digit of the left hand (Fig. ), and pain in the right femur with right inguinal lymphadenopathy. Treatment with a combination of ceftriaxone (2 gm/12 hr) and gentamicin (80 mg/8 hr) was administered subsequently. The femoral-inguinal symptoms and fever improved gradually with the antimicrobial therapy and therefore were ascribed to embolism. Although the clinical symptoms and signs improved after use of these antibiotics, ciprofloxacin (400 mg/12 hr) was administered as an alternative due to the eruption of a skin rash from an allergic reaction after 7 days' treatment with ceftriaxone. Ultimately, the patient received the treatment regimen for one month and was discharged. There were no sequelae at 6-month follow-up and the mitral vegetation disappeared in the follow-up echocardiogram performed one month after discharge.","[[40.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['body', 'body', 'apex', 'left lower sternal border', 'molar cavity', 'dental', 'liver', 'chest', 'right upper and lower lobes', 'abdominal', 'pulmonary', 'Transthoracic', 'anterior leaflet of mitral valve', 'mitral', 'cardiac', 'mitral valve', 'heart', 'disc', 'oral', 'tooth', 'fourth digit of the left hand', 'left hand', 'right femur', 'right inguinal', 'femoral-inguinal', 'skin', 'mitral']","['cough', 'fever', 'general malaise', 'anorexia', 'loss of 6 kg body weight', 'pansystolic murmur', 'abscess', 'dental pain', 'normocytic anemia', 'abnormal liver function', 'infiltration', 'splenomegaly', 'pulmonary tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'vegetation', 'mitral regurgitation', 'cardiac systolic and diastolic functions were normal', 'endocarditis', 'B. vesicularis', 'vegetation', 'fever', 'splenomegaly', 'heart murmur', 'anemia', ""Osler's node"", ""Roth's spot"", 'pathogen', 'D-maltose/D-glucose oxidation', 'inositol/D-sorbitol/L-arabinose oxidation', 'L-alanine/capric acid/potassium 5-ketogluconate/trisodium citrate decarboxylation', 'fever', 'infection of oral anaerobes', 'oral anaerobes', 'abscessed tooth', 'fever', ""Osler's node"", 'pain', 'right inguinal lymphadenopathy', 'femoral-inguinal symptoms', 'symptoms', 'fever', 'embolism', 'symptoms', 'signs', 'skin rash', 'allergic reaction', 'sequelae', 'mitral vegetation']","['amikacin', 'gentamicin', 'piperacillin', 'aztreonam', 'cefepime', 'meropenem', 'netilmicin', 'ampicillin', 'amoxicillin', 'ciprofloxacin', 'cefazolin', 'cefmetazole', 'ceftazidime', 'cefotaxime', 'ceftriaxone', 'ticarcillin', 'cefazolin', 'gentamicin', 'Ampicillin/sulbactam', 'amipicillin', 'sulbactam', 'ceftriaxone', 'gentamicin', 'ciprofloxacin', 'ceftriaxone']","['40', 'Roth', 'Marcy']","['vital signs', 'blood pressure', 'pulse rate', 'respiratory rate', 'body temperature', 'Physical examination', 'debridement', 'Laboratory tests', 'WBC count', 'neutrophils', 'hemoglobin level', 'ESR level', 'liver function', 'AST/ALT', 'chest x-ray film', 'abdominal sonography', 'serial acid-fast stain', 'culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Transthoracic echocardiography', 'ejection fraction', 'fraction shortening', 'blood culture', 'echocardiogram', 'laboratory', 'biochemical characteristics', 'L-alanine/capric acid', 'potassium 5-ketogluconate', 'trisodium citrate decarboxylation', 'nitrate reduction', 'indole production', 'susceptibility test', 'empiric antibiotics', 'removal of the abscessed tooth', 'Treatment', 'antimicrobial therapy', 'antibiotics', 'treatment', 'treatment regimen', 'echocardiogram']","['2-month', 'afternoon', 'previous 2 months', 'after 7 days', '6-month', 'one month']"
659,1781460-1,17229322,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1781460.xml,Severe paraneoplastic hypoglycemia in a patient with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor with an exon 9 mutation: a case report,"A 39 year-old man with a multifocal abdominal recurrence of a small bowel gastrointestinal stromal tumor presented to the hospital following loss of consciousness preceded by weakness, dizziness and nausea. His serum glucose was 20 mg/dL (normal 80–110 mg/dL) and required a continuous infusion of high dose (10%) dextrose to maintain a serum glucose concentration above 70 mg/dL. Serologic workup demonstrated no evidence of factitious hypoglycemia and it discarded the diagnosis of islet cell-induced hypoglycemia. The insulin like growth factor (IGF) I and IGF binding protein 3 level were below the normal range, while insulin, pro-insulin, C-peptide and IGF II levels were all in the normal range (table ).
An abdominal computed tomography demonstrated a large, multicentric tumor with extensive collateral circulation (Fig and ). Preoperative selective embolization of associated vessels was performed to reduce operative bleeding. The following day, extensive tumor debulking of both the dominant mass and 99% of the remaining multifocal 40 cm × 25 cm × 10 cm GIST was achieved (Fig and ), obtaining an R1 resection. Immediately after completing the resection, the patient became euglycemic without requiring intravenous glucose. The patient was euglycemic, active and without radiographic evidence of progression 6 months after his surgery. Due to gastrointestinal intolerance to imatinib, he is currently on therapy with sunitinib with stable disease.
Pathologic analysis identified the presence of KIT (CD-117) in the tumor; confirming GIST histology. Extracted DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction for exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 of KIT. No mutations were found in exons 11, 13 or 17; however one allele at position 1530 in exon 9 contained a 6 bp tandem repeat insert (GCCTAT). This led to a duplication of amino acid residues alanine 502 and tyrosine 503 (Fig ). The mutation was confirmed by a TOPO cloning system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California USA), which detected the presence of one normal allele and one with the 6 bp insert as described.
The patient's serum and tumor were sent to the University Medical Center in Utrecht (The Netherlands) for further analysis. The concentration of II E [68–88] (""big"" IGF-II) in plasma was 51.9 ng/mL (normal: 6.5–17.5 ng/mL). The levels of IGF binding protein 6 (IGFBP-6) were reported to be within the normal range. In situ hybridization of the tumor samples demonstrated high expression of IGF II mRNA and elevated pro-IGF II (figure ).
It has been found that specific KIT mutations in GIST may predict a patient's prognosis. Mutations on exon 11 are the most common (79%), while those on exon 9 are only found in about 11% of GIST. Most patients with exon 11 mutations respond to treatment with imatinib, while less than half of those with exon 9 mutations respond and are almost twice as likely to recur [-].
The particular mutation we found in our patient has been reported very infrequently, and is thought to induce a ligand-independent gain-of-function with homodimerization and constitutive autophosphorylation [,]. The significance of the association of this mutation and non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH) has yet to be established.
The incidence of NICTH is thought to be one fourth that of functional insulinomas (1 case of NICTH per million people-years) [,]. NICTH usually occurs with large or metastatic tumors that are usually of mesenchymal origin, but may also present in other types of cancer []. Searching via MEDLINE, PubMed, Gold Rush and article cross-referencing, we only found 4 other publications of NICTH in GIST; four of which had overexpression of ""big"" IGF II and in two there was overexpression of pro-IGF II [-].
High concentrations of pre-pro-IGF II genes that are not properly glycosylated result in the high molecular weight ""big"" IGF II. Compared to physiologic IGF II, it has a significantly higher affinity to the insulin receptor, and a lower affinity to its binding protein [,]. The association of ""big"" IGF II and NICTH was first identified by Daughaday in a patient with a fibrosarcoma []. Non-islet cell tumor-induced hypoglycemia secondary to ""big"" IGF II is difficult to confirm because laboratory tests for it are not readily available. A landmark observation by Teale et al. was that IGF I and II levels in patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia were both usually low, while patients with NICTH had normal levels of IGF II []. Consequently, Hizuka et al. demonstrated that IGF I was always low in hypoglycemic patients with ""big"" IGF II, while those without elevated ""big"" IGF II had both low IGF I and II [].
The management of most patients with NICTH requires prompt intravenous hydration and glucose infusions. Once stable, the ideal treatment is to remove the source of hypoglycemia. In NICTH, the hypoglycemia is not due to a dysfunctional insulin receptor nor abnormal K-ATP channels, therefore diazoxide is unlikely to be effective []. Attempts with imatinib as a first-line therapy may fail due to resistance to the drug, or take as long as 5 weeks before being able to interrupt the intravenous glucose infusions []. A recent report by Hamberg et al. [] found in one patient with NICTH from GIST that elevated concentrations of imatinib seemed to worsen hypoglycemia, while another patient spontaneously resolved without any GIST-related therapy. Alternative nonoperative cytoreductive techniques such as selective embolization and radiofrequency ablation may have a role in alleviating hypoglycemia; however these have not been reported in the literature. Additionally, they may potentially result in greater circulating ""big"" IGF II during necrosis of the GIST and may explain Hamberg's findings in a patient treated with imatinib alone that had hypoglycemia proportional to the dose of imatinib. In other (non GIST) cases of NICTH, low dose steroids and growth hormone have allowed palliative weaning from intravenous glucose [,,]. Surgical resection remains as the most rapid and cost-effective therapy to normalize glucose metabolism in most cases of NICTH.","[[39.0, 'year']]",M,2007,"['abdominal', 'small bowel gastrointestinal', 'abdominal', 'collateral', 'associated vessels', 'vessels', 'R1', 'gastrointestinal', 'exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 of KIT', 'exons 11, 13 or 17', 'position 1530 in exon 9', 'mesenchymal origin']","['small bowel gastrointestinal stromal tumor', 'loss of consciousness', 'weakness', 'dizziness', 'nausea', 'factitious hypoglycemia', 'islet cell-induced hypoglycemia', 'tumor', 'collateral circulation', 'selective embolization of associated vessels', 'operative bleeding', 'GIST', 'euglycemic', 'euglycemic', 'active', 'progression', 'gastrointestinal intolerance', 'stable disease', 'KIT', 'tumor', 'GIST', 'mutations', 'one allele', '6 bp tandem repeat insert', 'GCCTAT', 'duplication of amino acid residues alanine', 'duplication of amino acid residues alanine 502 and tyrosine 503', 'mutation', 'normal allele', '6 bp insert', 'tumor', 'IGF-II', 'high expression of IGF II mRNA', 'elevated pro-IGF II', 'specific KIT mutations in GIST', 'Mutations on exon 11', 'GIST', 'exon 11 mutations', 'exon 9 mutations', 'mutation', 'ligand-independent gain-of-function', 'homodimerization', 'constitutive autophosphorylation', 'mutation', 'non-islet cell tumor', 'non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia', 'hypoglycemia', 'NICTH', 'NICTH', 'functional insulinomas', 'NICTH', 'NICTH', 'tumors', 'cancer', 'NICTH', 'GIST', 'overexpression of ""big"" IGF II', 'overexpression of pro-IGF II', 'High concentrations of pre-pro-IGF II genes', 'properly glycosylated', 'IGF II.', 'IGF II', 'IGF II', 'NICTH', 'fibrosarcoma', 'Non-islet cell tumor-induced hypoglycemia', 'IGF II', 'hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia', 'hypoglycemic', 'NICTH', 'hypoglycemia', 'hypoglycemia', 'dysfunctional insulin receptor', 'abnormal K-ATP channels', 'NICTH', 'GIST', 'hypoglycemia', 'hypoglycemia', 'IGF II', 'necrosis of the GIST', ""Hamberg's"", 'hypoglycemia', 'NICTH', 'normalize glucose metabolism', 'NICTH']","['dextrose', 'glucose', 'imatinib', 'sunitinib', 'imatinib', 'glucose', 'diazoxide', 'imatinib', 'imatinib', 'imatinib', 'imatinib', 'glucose']","['39', 'Carlsbad, California USA', 'University Medical Center', 'Utrecht']","['serum glucose', 'serum glucose concentration', 'Serologic workup', 'insulin like growth factor (IGF) I', 'IGF binding protein 3 level', 'insulin', 'pro-insulin', 'C-peptide', 'IGF II levels', 'abdominal computed tomography', 'selective embolization of associated vessels', 'extensive tumor debulking of both the dominant mass', 'R1 resection', 'resection', 'surgery', 'therapy', 'Pathologic analysis', 'Extracted DNA', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'TOPO cloning system', 'serum', 'analysis', 'concentration of II E', 'plasma', 'IGF binding protein 6', 'IGFBP-6', 'situ hybridization of the tumor samples', 'IGF II mRNA', 'pro-IGF II', 'treatment', 'laboratory tests', 'IGF I', 'IGF I and II levels', 'NICTH', 'IGF II', 'IGF I', 'IGF II', 'IGF II', 'IGF I and II', 'hydration', 'glucose infusions', 'treatment', 'therapy', 'glucose infusions', 'GIST-related therapy', 'cytoreductive techniques', 'selective embolization', 'radiofrequency ablation', 'steroids', 'growth hormone', 'Surgical resection', 'therapy']","['Preoperative', 'Preoperative', '6 months', 'currently']"

Panoramic radiograph showed a multiloculated lesion on the left mandibular body (Fig. ). The surgical procedure was first planned on the virtual digital model (Fig. ), it helped us to measure exactly and to visualize the entity of the resection. A stereolithographic model of the left mandible was constructed. Prior to surgery, a mandibular reconstruction plate was pre-bent using the stereolithographic model as a reference. Screw placement was also planned and marked on the model, as well as screws length, which were recorded by measuring the thickness of the model at each plate hole (Fig. ).
The focus of the treatment was to resect the tumor and preserve the form of the mandible. Before resection, the reconstruction plate was placed intraorally along the inferior border of the mandible, and screw holes were drilled to facilitate later fixation of the plate. The time spent in adapting the reconstruction plate was less than 5 minutes because no adjustments to the plate were necessary.
The iliac microvascular flap was harvested and modelled using the dimensional data recorded during the preoperative planning on the digital model and on the stereolithographic model. The insertion of the flap in the osseus gap was easy and with excellent fit (Fig. ). 6 months after the reconstruction, the plate was removed and implants were inserted (Fig. , , ).","[[28.0, 'year']]",M,2007,"['left mandibular body', 'left mandible', 'mandibular', 'mandible', 'inferior border of the mandible', 'iliac microvascular', 'iliac microvascular flap', 'osseus gap']","['ameloblastoma', 'lesion', 'tumor']",[],['28'],"['treatment', 'Panoramic radiograph', 'surgical procedure', 'resection', 'stereolithographic model of the left mandible', 'surgery', 'mandibular reconstruction plate was pre-bent', 'Screw placement', 'treatment', 'resect the tumor', 'resect the tumor and preserve the form of the mandible', 'reconstruction plate was placed intraorally along the inferior border of the mandible', 'screw holes were drilled to facilitate later fixation of the plate', 'iliac microvascular flap was harvested', 'insertion of the flap in the osseus gap', 'reconstruction', 'plate was removed', 'implants were inserted']",['6 months']

Other medical, surgical, or family histories were unremarkable.
The patient was seen with a 6-month history of abdominal distention and discomfort. At physical examination, no abdominal masses or ascites were detected. A pelvic ultrasound (US) was performed, and an adnexal cystic mass of 19 × 16 × 12 cm with solid component was observed in the area of the left adnexa. There was no ascites or any other abnormalities observed in the pelvic cavity. Serum CA-125 was 4.13 U/ml, and routine preoperative laboratory tests were obtained and reported as normal, as was the chest x-ray. A CT scan was conducted as part of the preoperative evaluation; the scan confirmed the US findings and revealed solid areas in a cystic tumor (Figures and ).
An exploratory laparotomy was performed with the diagnosis of a suspicious malignant adenexal mass. During the procedure, a tumor measuring 19 × 16 × 12 cm was found in the left retroperitoneal space, the tumor completely separated from the ovaries or other intrapelvic structures. Complete and intact removal of the lesion was obtained; this was sent for frozen section, and was subsequently reported as mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. At the time of the surgery, both ovaries and fallopian tubes were grossly normal, as were all intra-abdominal structures. The patient's postoperative course showed no complications or adverse events. Six courses of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered with carboplatinum at a dose of 6 area under the curve (AUC) and paclitaxel at 175 mgs/m2. CA-125 was obtained after the fifth chemotherapy course and was reported as 5.3 U/ml. A pelvic US was performed 8 months later, and a new pelvic mass measuring 7 × 6 × 6 cm at the same site was found. An exploratory laparotomy was conducted and a sigmoid resection was required due to a mass involving this. Infracolic omentectomy was also carried out due to multiple nodules. The surgery was considered optimal cytoreduction with no visible lesion remaining. The Pathology report stated mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.
Second-line chemotherapy was initiated with oral etoposide (50 mg daily for 21 days). After one cycle, disease progression was identified and the patient decided to stop chemotherapy.

He had previously undergone orchidopexy in childhood for a mal-descended right testis. There is otherwise no other significant medical or family history. The mid-scrotally located mass measured 4 × 7 cm and was nodular, hard and clinically separate from the testes. It was not attached to the scrotal skin or other underlying structures. Lymphadenopathy was not detected.
Initial ultrasonography (Fig ) showed a large extra-testicular and multinodular mass in the midline of the scrotum. The largest nodule, located behind the right testis was cystic. Both testes appeared normal. Subsequent staging Computer Tomography (CT) of the scrotum, abdomen and chest was performed, which identified a similarly localised heterogeneous mass of 6.9 × 3.7 cm, separate from the testes (Fig ) and did not extend into the tunica vaginalis. There was no evidence of distant or nodal metastases.
An initial diagnostic wedge biopsy indicated the lesion could be an ancient schwannoma. Curative surgical excision with partial scrotectomy was undertaken for removal of the mass and for definitive diagnosis. At resection, the tumour appeared to be superficial to the tunica vaginalis, testes and corpus spongiosum. Inferiorly, the tumour was attached to the bulbospongiosus requiring partial resection of the superficial muscle fibres.
The resected specimen (Fig ) was white and multinodular, with areas of cystic change and haemorrhage. Microscopically (Fig ), proliferation of spindled shaped cells with fibrillary cytoplasm was seen, with dense fibrous bands arranging the cells into nodules. In some cells, marked nuclear hyperchromaticism and atypia were seen. Mitoses were not present. Within the lesion, cellular areas were interspersed with looser myxoid and cystic areas. Blood vessels with thickened hyalinised walls were noted. Staining for S100 protein was positive in the tumour cells. The histological features are that of an ancient schwannoma.

She received adjuvant radiation and started tamoxifen 20 mg daily four months before admission. At the clinical examination, she had several purpuric papular lesions in both distal extremities, some were confluent, within a 1 cm diameter on the left external heel. Arthritis was also present in both ankles and knees. Liver function tests demonstrated a cholestatic damage, with increase of alkaline phosphatase (196; normal: 40–150 U/L), GGT (213; normal> 12–43), SGPT (249; normal 5–66 U/L), SGOT (110; normal 9–55 U/L); other liver tests, and the rest of laboratory, including SMA-18, blood cytology, coagulation studies, viral hepatitis infection markers, antinuclear antibodies, coagulation tests and crioaglutinines were normal.

She had grown normal along the 50th height percentile. X rays of her spine revealed oedematous changes of 3 and compressions of 2 thoracic vertebrae (# 9, 11). At first these were considered trauma related, however, especially posterior oedematous changes of the 8th vertebra were considered not to be typical sequels of a trauma (figure figure ). In addition, a technetium bone scan did show an additional lesion in the right 4th rib (figure ). The rib lesion was also analysed by MRI of the thorax. It did show a strong T2/TIRM/STIR signal. Thus Langerhans' cell histiocytosis was suspected at that time. A biopsy of this rib, however, revealed a sterile lympho- plasmocytoid osteomyelitis suggesting multifocal CNO. There were no elevated inflammatory parameters (ESR, CRP, leukocytes). A differential blood count did not show signs of malignancy. Further workup revealed normal serum levels of beta-HCG (human choriogonadotropin), neuron specific enolase, cortisol and angiotensin converting enzyme. HLA B 27 was present. Total alkaline phosphatase levels (401, 426, 316, 378, 185, 189 U/l) measured over time were in the normal range. Compared to a cohort of genetically diagnosed childhood hypophosphatasia patients [,] these levels were considered unremarkable. However, a nephelometric measurement of the bone alkaline phosphatase revealed a reduced level (8.9 microg/l; normal 36–80 microg/l). Therefore, a more reliable and specific measurement of the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase in leukocytes was done. The result was below normal (1.8 nmol/min/mg Protein; normal: 2 – 18) []. In addition, pyridoxal phosphate in the plasma was slightly elevated (31 ng/ml; normal: 5 – 30 ng/ml), phosphoethanolamine excretion in the urine was normal. We suggested that a partial defect in the TNSALP gene was present. She may be a carrier of one severely mutated allele of alkaline phosphatase, because slight elevation of plasma pyridoxal levels has been demonstrated in obligatory heterozygotes (parents of index patients) with severe alleles []. Thus, the patient might be a carrier for the hypophosphatasia trait. The family refused a diagnostic genetic workup.
Based on our experience in treating hypophosphatasia patients with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents [,], in addition to the anti-inflammatory treatment of chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis patients [] we started a therapy using naproxen at a dose of 15 mg/kg/d in both patients. This therapeutic protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Wuerzburg.
The treatment rapidly reduced clinical symptoms including pain and soft tissue swelling (figure ). Parallel to this clinical improvement subsequent MRI analysis after 3, 6 and 12 months revealed subsequent reduction of bone marrow oedema and local gadolinium enhancement. 12 months later MRI showed almost unremarkable lesions (figure ). Mild hyperostosis of the os zygomaticum was still present after 12 months at treatment cessation. 24 months later the patient was still in remission.
The medication did abrogate pain completely after the first 3 months of treatment. Parallel to this clinical improvement subsequent MRI analysis (figure ) after 3, 6 and 12 (figure ) months revealed subsequent reduction of bone marrow oedema and local gadolinium enhancement. 12 months later MRI showed an unremarkable 8th thoracic vertebra, whereas the 9th and 11th still showed compression without sign of acute inflammation (figure ).

Gastroscopy showed mucosal nodularity and ulceration at the proximal gastric body with an ""hour glass"" deformity, an appearance suggestive of malignancy. Multiple mucosal biopsies were obtained and histopathology revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and chronic gastritis. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed diffuse thickening of the gastric wall and a few enlarged lymph nodes in the lesser sac.
The patient underwent an elective D2 total gastrectomy with splenectomy as the bulky gastric tumour was extending into the splenic hilus and a Roux-en-Y reconstruction was performed.
The histopathological examination of the specimen macroscopically showed firm texture of the proximal stomach and vague nodular appearance of the mucosa over a 100 by 80 mm area. Microscopically the proximal stomach showed transmural infiltration by poorly differentiated diffuse adenocarcinoma, which had reached the serosal surface. There was vascular invasion, infiltration of 10 out of 34 nodes and numerous extranodal tumour deposits. A nodule of firm white tissue, 9mm diameter, was present on the external surface of the gastric antrum. Histological examination revealed this nodule to be a benign gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), which had arisen from the muscularis propria. It was composed of interwoven cytologically bland spindle shaped cells that were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry to be uniformly positive for CD117. Scattered spindle cells of the GIST also expressed smooth muscle actin, desmin and S-100 (Fig. , , ). Cytoceratin immunohistochemistry was negative. An additional finding was the presence within the GIST of numerous cytokeratin positive polygonal-shaped gastric carcinoma cells (Fig. ).

There was no history of trauma. The pain was moderate, not characteristic of torsion, and not the chief complaint. Oral temperature was 37.8°C and pulse 94/min. Physical examination revealed bilateral red swollen scrotum, moderately hot and tender allowing examination of the testes, which were in normal position and of equal size and not tender. There was a small amount of fluid bilaterally detected on transillumination. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory work up showed Hb. 10.5 gm/dl, Hct. 32%, WBC 12.7 × 103/mm3 and normal serum amylase. Ultrasound examination confirmed the equal sized testes, with normal echogenicity, the presence of small amount of fluid in the scrotum, and the edematous scrotum. On further examination of the scrotum, a streak of redness extended along the midline raphe to the perineum, where a visible wire through an eroded perianal skin was seen (Fig ). The patient underwent a Thiersch wire insertion for a rectal prolapse one year before. The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ampicillin, Gentamycin and Metronidazol). It was decided that the Thiersch wire has to be removed in theatre under general anesthesia. While examination under anesthesia the perineum appeared healthy, without signs of inflammation, or suppuration but moderate amount of induration. Rectal exam was normal; there was moderate narrowing and fibrosis at the anal verge. After removal of the wire the tract was intact with minimal discharge, which cleared in few days following wire removal. The sinus tract was very short lived and closed without any problems thereafter.
Culture taken from the site of the wound grew streptococcus fecalis sensitive to the administered antibiotics. The scrotal swelling and redness subsided gradually. The child was discharged without any complications. Follow up was uneventful for both the scrotal redness and swelling as well as the rectal prolapse.","[[4.0, 'year']]",M,2006,"['scrotum', 'scrotum', 'testes', 'testes', 'scrotum', 'scrotum', 'scrotum', 'midline raphe to the perineum', 'perianal skin', 'rectal', 'perineum', 'Rectal', 'anal verge', 'tract', 'sinus tract', 'site of the wound', 'scrotal', 'scrotal', 'rectal']","['swelling', 'redness', 'pain', 'trauma', 'pain', 'torsion', 'bilateral red swollen scrotum', 'hot', 'tender', 'normal position', 'equal size', 'tender', 'fluid bilaterally', 'normal serum amylase', 'equal sized testes', 'normal echogenicity', 'fluid', 'edematous scrotum', 'streak of redness', 'redness', 'visible wire through an eroded perianal skin', 'rectal prolapse', 'healthy', 'inflammation', 'suppuration', 'induration', 'narrowing', 'fibrosis', 'tract was intact', 'discharge', 'short lived', 'problems', 'wound', 'streptococcus fecalis', 'swelling', 'redness', 'complications', 'redness', 'swelling', 'rectal prolapse']","['Ampicillin', 'Gentamycin', 'Metronidazol']","['B.S.', '4', 'pediatric surgical ward', 'Jordan University Hospital']","['Oral temperature', 'pulse', 'Physical examination', 'transillumination', 'physical examination', 'Laboratory work up', 'Hb.', 'Hct', 'WBC', 'serum amylase', 'Ultrasound examination', 'Thiersch wire insertion for a rectal prolapse', 'broad-spectrum antibiotics', 'Thiersch wire has to be removed', 'general anesthesia', 'examination', 'anesthesia', 'Rectal exam', 'removal of the wire', 'wire removal', 'Culture', 'antibiotics']","['two days', 'two days', 'two days', 'one year before']"

A trucut® biopsy was suggestive of fibromatosis. Computerized tomogram (CT) scan revealed a large soft tissue mass infiltrating the massetter, parotid gland, floor mouth, submandibular gland, the lateral oro-nasopharyngeal wall and the pterygoid muscle. The horizontal ramus of mandible was eroded and the mass extended across the midline. Excision of the mass with segmental mandibulectomy was performed. Reconstruction with a free fibula was deferred for a later stage in view of the young age, large mass and concern of recurrent disease. Since the mucosal defect following excision was not large enough primary closure was performed. Histopathology confirmed juvenile fibromatosis and all cut margins of resection were free of tumour. The patient presented after 13 months with recurrent swelling over the cheek with significant difficulty in swallowing and constant dribbling of saliva due to inadequate mouth closure (Figure ). A CT scan revealed presence of a large recurrent mass in the floor of mouth, infiltrating the infratemporal fossa (ITF) and reaching up to the base of skull (Figure ). In view of the extensive recurrence low dose chemotherapy (weekly vinblastine, methotrexate and tamoxifen) was started. After completion of 12 weeks of chemotherapy, a partial response was achieved. Excision of the mass with ITF clearance was performed subsequently. A portion of tongue and its base along with the lateral oropharyngeal and the soft palate was also excised (Figure. ) The defect following resection was large and a free flap was not feasible as the external carotid artery was ligated at previous surgery. Reconstruction with a PMMC flap for providing mucosal cover and soft tissue bulk for defect was considered. In view of the large mucosal defect a large skin paddle was taken incorporating the nipple-areola complex. The technique for harvesting the PMMC has been described previously [] (Figure ). The edges of the flap were sutured circumferentially to the mucosa of the oral cavity except superiorly where the mucosa was deficient; the flap was anchored to the hard palate with non-absorbable sutures.
Patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged after ten days. The flap was well taken without any necrosis or other complication. Guide bite prosthesis was used after a week of surgery to prevent malocclusion. Histopathological examination revealed all cut margins to be free of tumour. Patient further received 12 weeks of low dose chemotherapy. At one year follow-up the patient is having normal speech and swallowing and is free from recurrent disease.","[[3.0, 'year']]",M,2007,"['cheek', 'submandibular', 'submental', 'postauricular region', 'soft tissue', 'massetter', 'parotid gland', 'floor mouth', 'submandibular gland', 'lateral oro-nasopharyngeal wall', 'pterygoid muscle', 'horizontal ramus of mandible', 'fibula', 'mucosal', 'cheek', 'mouth', 'floor of mouth', 'infratemporal fossa (ITF)', 'base of skull', 'portion of tongue and its base', 'lateral oropharyngeal', 'soft palate', 'external carotid artery', 'mucosal', 'soft tissue', 'mucosal', 'skin', 'nipple-areola complex', 'PMMC', 'mucosa of the oral cavity', 'mucosa', 'hard palate']","['swelling', 'increasing in size', 'fibromatosis', 'soft tissue mass', 'eroded', 'mass', 'mass', 'mass', 'disease', 'mucosal defect', 'juvenile fibromatosis', 'all cut margins of resection were free of tumour', 'swelling', 'difficulty in swallowing', 'dribbling of saliva', 'inadequate mouth closure', 'mass', 'mass', 'defect', 'mucosal defect', 'defect', 'skin paddle', 'mucosa was deficient', 'uneventful recovery', 'necrosis', 'complication', 'malocclusion', 'cut margins to be free of tumour', 'tumour', 'normal speech and swallowing', 'disease']","['vinblastine', 'methotrexate', 'tamoxifen']",['3'],"['trucut® biopsy', 'Computerized tomogram (CT) scan', 'Excision of the mass with segmental mandibulectomy', 'Reconstruction with a free fibula', 'excision', 'primary closure', 'Histopathology', 'CT', 'CT scan', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'Excision of the mass with ITF clearance', 'portion of tongue and its base along with the lateral oropharyngeal and the soft palate was also excised', 'resection', 'free flap', 'external carotid artery was ligated', 'surgery', 'Reconstruction with a PMMC flap for providing mucosal cover', 'Reconstruction with a PMMC flap for providing mucosal cover and soft tissue bulk for defect', 'harvesting the PMMC', 'edges of the flap were sutured circumferentially to the mucosa of the oral cavity except superiorly where the mucosa was deficient', 'flap was anchored to the hard palate with non-absorbable sutures', 'flap was well taken without any necrosis or other complication', 'Guide bite prosthesis was used after a week of surgery to prevent malocclusion', 'Histopathological examination', 'chemotherapy']","['13 months', '13 months', '13 months', 'one year']"

She presented at age 17 with inability to abduct her legs against any resistance on an exercise machine; other muscle groups were strong. Following her first pregnancy at age 20, she noticed weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, and tripping and falling that progressed in frequency over the next 3 years from once a month to once a week. A muscle biopsy and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of HIBM with homozygous M712T mutations in GNE. At age 25, she noted difficulty fastening snaps and could not raise her arms to pull back her hair. Progression was gradual, with more significant decline following illnesses. Treatments included solumederol, 1 g intravenously for 3 days, which resulted in improved strength but was followed by relapse. On one occasion, IVIG (dose unknown) was given over 3 days, providing no improvement but complicated by aseptic meningitis requiring hospitalization. For the 6 months prior to admission, the patient used a wheelchair and required assistance walking and with transfers. Medications included sertraline for depression and anxiety, and vitamins.

The upper extremities were most affected, but leg weakness was evident by decreased endurance, speed of walking, and getting in and out of a car. He occasionally used his hands to lift his legs. Symptoms were largely stable, but exacerbated by emotional events. He did not receive any treatment for his myopathy, and medications included only multivitamins.

an Elective Abortion: The Need for New Data","A 22-year-old female with two prior full-term deliveries underwent
an elective abortion at 15 weeks gestation at a clinic, 8 weeks
prior to admission at our medical center. The procedure was
uncomplicated; the patient does not remember receiving antibiotics
or being tested for GBS. Her past medical history was
noncontributory although she reports a negative HIV test one month
prior to admission. She denies using illicit drugs, any injection
therapy, or any recent tattoos.
One week after the abortion, she developed low-grade fever and
malaise and returned for a repeat cervical dilation and uterine
evacuation. Genital cultures grew GBS, Candida albicans,
and oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. She was
discharged with 7 days of amoxicillin.
Two weeks later, she presented to another hospital complaining of
fever, chills, productive cough, dyspnea, and diffuse chest pain
of 5 days duration. She was febrile with enlarged tonsils, no
evidence of cardiac abnormalities, rales in bilateral lung bases,
and a benign abdomen. A sterile speculum exam revealed
yellow-green discharge from the cervix; cultures were sent. She
was admitted and treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and
metronidazole. CT showed diffuse, patchy infiltrates in the lower
lobes with cavitations and no evidence of a pulmonary embolism.
Blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in chains presumed to be
S pneumonia and nafcillin was added. She left against
medical advice and two weeks later presented to our Emergency
Department (ED) with worsening fevers, chills, SOB, productive
cough, and pleuritic chest pain. In the ED, she was again treated
with cefotaxime and azithromycin for presumed community acquired
pneumonia and intravenous heparin for possible PE.
On exam she was febrile, hypotensive, tachycardic, and tachypneic.
Oxygen saturation was 87% on room air. She had pale
conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes. Lung exam revealed diffuse
rhonchi and decreased breath sounds on the right. On
cardiovascular exam, her neck showed cannon v waves along with a
3/6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal
border. Abdominal and extremity exams were benign. There were no
signs of Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions.
Her CBC revealed a WBC of 19.3, hemoglobin of 9.6, and platelets
of 81 000. D-dimer was 4540 ng/mL; beta hCG was negative. Chest
radiograph showed bilateral, fluffy, lower lobe infiltrates with
peripheral cavitations. Ultrasound of the lower extremities for
deep vein thromboses was negative. EKG revealed sinus tachycardia
and right ventricular conduction delay (RSR'). CT of the chest,
abdomen, and pelvis revealed large, bilateral, peripheral lower
lobe cavitary lesions.
She was admitted to the ICU and treated with penicillin G,
gentamicin, and clindamycin. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures of 55 mmHg,
right atrial and right ventricular dilation, and large tricuspid
valve vegetation with severe tricuspid regurgitation ().
Left ventricular ejection fraction was
56%.
Blood cultures were reported positive in 12 hours with GBS,
sensitive to penicillin (MIC 0.12) and cefotaxime (MIC 0.12).
Clindamycin was stopped.
Throughout her stay, the patient was persistently febrile. Repeat
CT of the chest, 2 weeks after admission, showed improving
pulmonary infiltrates; multiple, bilateral cavitary lesions
increased in size; cardiomegaly with a very large right atrium and
suprahepatic inferior vena cava, along with a severely enlarged
liver suggesting right heart failure.
She was treated with 3 weeks of gentamicin and discharged on
continued intravenous penicillin G for a total of 6 weeks of
therapy. Although her echocardiograms and CT scans showed evidence
of right heart failure, she had no clinical evidence of this; it
was decided to monitor the patient closely and forgo surgery. The
patient missed two followup appointments after her discharge.
She appeared in the ED a few months later complaining of chest
pain and dyspnea on exertion. CT scan of chest showed left
descending pulmonary artery aneurysm without clot or dissection
but clear evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Echocardiogram in
the ED revealed normal LV motion and ejection fraction, complete
resolution of the vegetation, pulmonary artery peak systolic
pressure of 41 mmHg, a thickened tricuspid valve with severe
regurgitation, and septal flattening consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The cardiologist evaluated the

left inguinal region, chills and high fever over a week. She has
had hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus and has used oral
anti-diabetic and anti-hypertension drugs for 8 years. She had no
history of previous trauma, operation, underlying skin lesion, use
of foreign body or human bite on her vulvar region. Two days after
onset, her left part of the vulva became swelling and the lesions
color turned to red. Even though she had used
amoxicilline-clavulanic acid and ornidasole for three days, the
lesion on the vulva and pain worsened.
In clinical examination her fever 38°C,
pulse 96/dk, blood pressure 160/80 mmHg, in the left part
of the vulva there was an erode lesion in the certain part of the
inflammatory halo. The lesion was 5 × 4 cm in size, red,
hot, swollen, and painful and fluctuant. Local tenderness and
edema were also marked (). The borders of the
lesion was not elevated and sharply demarcated.
Laboratory values were as follows: WBC count, 18200/ mm3
(82% neutrophils, 8% lymphocyte, 8% monocytes)
[4000–10000/mm3]; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 122 mm/hour [0–20 mm/hour];
C-reactive protein, (++++)[negatif]; and blood glucose,
235 mg/dL [70–110 mg/dL].
Vulvar abscess was diagnosed and it was drained. In Gram stain of
the pus, granulocytes (80% neutrophil), Gram-negative rods
and Gram-positive cocci were detected. Ampicilline-sulbactam
4 × 1 gr IV/day, ciprofloxacin 2 × 400 mg

X-ray showed delayed bone development. She had low-pitched cry, short neck with limited movement, stiff muscle tone (unable to sit, she was still fisting), fixed flexion of both elbows, and she did not show any sign of speaking or babble (Fig. and ). Moreover she had tied tongue and thin skin. Her brain stem evoked potential test showed conductive hearing loss. She was about 27 inches in length, her weight was 3 kilograms and there were no records about her birth weight. Her skull circumference was 35 cm. Finally, she showed a number of features not typical of BDLS, including crowded ribs by chest by X-ray (distance between each rib is short). Hepatomegally was shown by ultrasonography.
Peripheral blood from the patient was subjected to short-term culture in RPMI 1640 medium for 72 hours.

She was right-hand dominant and a housewife. There was no history of trauma, insect bites or drainage from the area. There was no significant past medical or surgical history. She was not on any prescribed medication. There was no family history of tumours. She denied smoking, alcohol and drug abuse. On examination, a non-tender, firm to palpation, well-demarcated and tethered to the subcutaneous tissues mass, surrounded by mild erythema, and measuring approximately 2.5 cm × 3.0 cm was revealed, in the absence of palpable lymph nodes at the ipsilateral elbow or axilla. There were no other abnormal signs.
Haematological and biochemical investigations were within the normal range. A plain X-ray of the right hand and forearm was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the mass to have infiltrated all skin layers and to have encircled the ulnar artery without involvement of the underlying bones (Figure ). The absence of a signal void from within the mass excluded a diagnosis of haemangioma. Ultrasound-guided needle biopsy showed lesional areas consistent with collagenous fibrous tissue of varying cellularity, with little evidence of mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin (SMA), suggesting myofibroblastic differentiation. Histological appearances were in keeping with fibromatosis.
Three weeks after initial presentation, the lesion was excised preserving the ulnar nerve and artery. Histology showed a multi-nodular, well-circumscribed uniform spindle cell lesion with varying cellularity and fibrosis. In one section, central cyst formation was observed. Occasional mitoses of normal morphology were seen. Necrosis was not a feature. In several areas, the lesion appeared to be intravascular, the vessel was lined by an apparent endothelium (Figure ). Scattered osteoclast-like multi-nucleate giant cells were also observed. Immunohistochemistry replicated diffuse positivity for SMA, but not for desmin, CD34 or S100 protein. Appearances were consistent with a myofibroblastic proliferation, confirming a diagnosis of intravascular fasciitis (IVF).

The cerebral abscess was surgically drained and the patient, after recovery, remained asymptomatic for the following 11 y. In the current clinical evaluation, physical examination revealed no cyanosis, heart rate of 80 bpm, arterial blood pressure of 110 × 70 mmHg; apical impulse was normopositioned at the 50 intercostal space. Cardiac rhythm was regular and there was a harsh intense ejection murmur in the low external border.
The ECG showed: sinus rhythm, right axis deviation, right ventricular overload and a minor degree of right bundle branch block. Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure and Figure ) showed: a 17 mm perimembranous VSD associated to a slow velocity flow from left to right ventricle; aortic root was slightly deviated to the right. In addition, there was RV hypertrophy and a muscular septation inside this cavity causing obstruction with a peak gradient of 80 mmHg. There was no obstruction to flow in the right outflow tract and the site of the right obstruction was displaced proximally preserving the right ventricular infundibulum. The pulmonary valve was completely normal.

The post-transplant course was complicated by severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) of the skin, thrombocytopenia, and systemic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, causing treatment-induced renal failure that necessitated hemodialysis (Table ).
Nine months after HSCT, he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with septic shock, which was treated with empiric antibiotics, vasoactive medication, and mechanical ventilation. Seven days after ICU admission, the FiO2 requirement suddenly increased to 1.0 and fresh blood was coming from the endotracheal tube. The platelet count was 10 × 109 per liter and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was 40 seconds. Despite platelet transfusion to a platelet count of more than 100 × 109 per liter and FFP administration to an APTT of less than 35 seconds (in addition to the standard treatment as described in Materials and methods), the bleeding increased in severity. rFVIIa was administered intravenously in doses of up to 120 μg/kg without hemostatic effect. Bronchoscopy revealed fresh bleeding from both lungs. rFVIIa (50 μg/kg) dissolved in saline was administered by BAL into the left and right main bronchi simultaneously with the systemic i.v. administration of 50 μg/kg rFVIIa. This resulted in an immediate cessation of the bleeding from the endotracheal tube. The arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/FiO2 ratio increased the subsequent day. The hemostatic effect lasted for approximately 36 hours, after which bleeding recurred. The treatment was repeated twice also, and bleeding ceased for more than 24 hours. Hereafter, the patient received rFVIIa (50 μg/kg) by BAL alone twice, and bleeding ceased for 24 to 36 hours after each administration. Complete hemostasis was obtained after the third BAL administration of rFVIIa and lasted for three months (Table ).

The mammograms revealed en equivocal lesion. Ultrasonography identified a 14 mm tumor that was suspicious for malignancy. A FNAC was done under ultrasound guidance.
The smears were stained with Diff-Quick® (Dade AG, Düdingen, Germany). The aspirates were cellular and consisted mainly of single spindle or polymorphic, polygonal cells with a few admixed groups of benign ductal epithelial cells (Figure ) and lymphocytes.
The nuclei were generally large, ranging from 2 - > 5 × RBC. Most nuclei had a distinct medium-sized nucleolus. The nuclear outlines were irregular with buds and folds. The chromatin was granular. A few cells showing intranuclear cytoplasmic vacuoles were found (Figure ). The cytoplasm was bluish, variable in amount and often dense (Figure ). In the background there was abundant granular metachromatic ground substance and some metachromatic stromal fragments (Figures , and ). A few mitotic figures were found (Figure ). There was no necrotic debris.
The cytologic diagnosis was suspicious for malignancy and a metaplastic carcinoma where only the non-epithelial component had been aspirated, or a non-epithelial lesion, was suggested. No smears were available for immunocytochemistry.
The histopathological characteristics are shown in Figures , , , , , , , , , , , . Macroscopically the tumor was round, seemingly well circumscribed, firm and with a white cut surface. The diameter was 14 mm. On microscopy, the lesion was cellular (Figures and ), consisting of spindled and polygonal cells with distinct pleomorphism (Figures , , ). There were variable amounts of eosinophilic ground substance (Figures , and ) and a focal admixture of lymphocytes (Figures and ). There were 6–9 mitoses per high power field (HPF) (Figure ) The tumor infiltrated in the surrounding fatty tissue (Figures , , ).
On immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were positive for smooth muscle actin (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) (Figure ), keratin MNF 116 (a pan-keratin with both high- and low molecular weight keratins from DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) (Figure ) and vimentin (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark)(Figure ).

Eight years previously, she was diagnosed with hepatic hamartoma by fine needle biopsy. She did not accept effective treatment, and subsequently presented with epigastric distention. A history of hepatitis (HBV, HCV) and hepatic cirrhosis were excluded with appropriate tests. Physical examination revealed slight paleness of the skin and mucosa and no jaundice. Abdominal palpation demonstrated the presence of shifting dullness and hepatomegaly without obvious tenderness. No other abnormal signs were found.
The patients' blood results were as follows:
Hematology; RBC: 3.64 × 1012/L, Hb: 61 g/L, WBC: 4.40 × 109/L and PLT: 126 × 109/L. Biochemistry; showed: ALT 23 U/L, AST 35 U/L, ALP 386 U/L, ALB 28.0 g/L, TP 50.4 g/L, GLB 22.4 g/L and GGT 254 U/L. Serum markers for HBV and HCV were negative. AFP, CA125, CA199 and CEA were normal.
Both ultrasonography and spiral computerized tomography (CT) revealed an enlarged liver with rugositied surface. Multinodular focuses involved the whole liver accompanied with calcified plaques, cholecystolithiasis, multiple tiny nodules under the peritoneum and ascites (figure ).
After a multidisciplinary consensus, the patient underwent surgery including omentectomy and excisional biopsy of liver tumors. In the operation, asymmetrical nodules were noticed on the whole liver and beneath the peritoneum. One was located at colic omentum with 1.5 cm diameter. Frozen section biopsy revealed angiosarcoma. Therefore, only colic omentum resection and hepatic multi-point biopsy were performed.
Postoperative pathology revealed angiosarcoma (figure ) arising from hepatic hamartoma (figure ) accompaniedwith coelio-implantation metastasis. Subsequent immunohistochemistry revealed the lesions were CD34(+) (figure ), Vimentin(+) (figure ), S-100(-), CEA(-) and CK(-) (Zymed).

He was noted to have splenomegaly in a routine follow up. Laboratory data were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase, 126 U/litre (normal, < 40); alanine aminotransferase, 66 U/litre (normal, < 36); alkaline phosphatase, 123 U/litre (normal, < 96); and γ-glutamyltransferase, 178 IU/litre (normal, < 96). Serum fetoprotein was 256 μg/litre (normal, < 20). Serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen was positive and antihepatitis C virus antibody was negative.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen showed an approximately 3.5 cm in diameter with a heterogeneous, hypervascular enhancing mass in the left lateral segment of the liver. A multiple, small-to-moderate nodules composed of a low-density area throughout the parenchyma was present in the enlarged spleen. There were no tumor thrombi within the portal veins and lymphadenopathy (Figure ).
Positron emission tomography findings revealed the ringed dense uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in the spleen. It was not absorbed in the lymph nodes of the splenic hilus and behind the pancreatic head; there were no abnormal hot areas in the liver.
After the liver tumor and spleen were resected, the serum fetoprotein concentrations returned to within the normal range. However, the patient who was treated symptomatically and not treated with chemotherapy due to poor general condition died 6 months after surgical resection.
Grossly, the resected liver tissue measured 10 × 7 × 5 cm. There was a well circumscribed tumor measuring 4 × 3 × 3 cm. The mass was grey and soft with a small area of bleeding, necrosis and intact capsule. The non-tumorous portion showed obvious cirrhotic nodularity. The resected spleen measured 25 × 17 × 7.5 cm and weighed 1750 g. The outer capsule was smooth, glistening, and intact. Cut surface of the spleen was red-purple and had a diffuse reticulonodular appearance indicative of prominent white pulp. Splenic hilar and mesenteric lymph nodes were not enlarged obviously.
On histologic sections, the tumor cells were growing in cords of variable thickness, which were separated by sinusoid-like blood spaces in the liver mass. Diffuse fatty change of tumor cells was found in small area (Figure ). The non-tumour part showed cirrhotic change. The tumor in the spleen was characterised by a micronodular lymphoid infiltrate located in white pulp, with variable red pulp infiltration, marginal zone differentiation and follicular replacement by neoplastic cells (Figure ). The white pulp tumoral nodules were composed of an inner central zone of small lymphocytes, located in the mantle zone and replacing the germinal center, and a peripheral zone of medium-sized cells with clear cytoplasm and scattered blasts (Figure ), the marginal zone component. Splenic hilar and mesenteric lymph nodes were not effaced with intact capsules, sinuses, and germinal centers.
Immunohistochemical staining of the neoplastic cells showed positivity for CD20, CD79α (Figure ), Pax-5, bcl-2 and lacked co-expression of cyclin D, CD30, CD3, CD5, bcl-6, bcl-10, CD68, and cytokeratin, indicating that the tumor was B-cell lymphoma. The proliferative index is low, and Ki67 staining showed a distinctive annular pattern, outlining the presence of an increased growth fraction in the germinal center and marginal zone.
Amplification of Immunoglobulin heavy chain genes was performed by semi-nested PCR, using primers directed to the framework 2 (FR-2) region and to the joining region (JH) as described previously [,] Gene rearrangement studies also supported a clonal B-cell process with heavy chain rearrangement (Figure ).

He was a former intravenous drug user (IVDU) and had been enrolled in a MMT program since 1990, taking between 80 and 100 mg methadone daily. He also had a history of anxiety and mood disorders, and had been taking clonazepam, 1 mg 4 times daily since 1999. At transplant evaluation, the patient had solid psychosocial support (family and counseling) and had a consistent ten year adherence to his MMT, including negative toxicological screens. The UCDMC transplant team determined that it would be in the patient's best interest to continue his MMT pre and post transplant.
The patient had a MELD score of 15 at the time of transplant. He tolerated the operation well with no major complications during surgery, although he did require more intraoperative anesthesia than the average non-MMT patient. Post-operative pain management during hospitalization required consultation with pain specialists and the doses of hydromorphone and morphine were higher than the average non -MMT transplant patients. On post-operative day six, the patient resumed a normal diet; his pain was managed with oral narcotic analgesics; he was fully ambulatory and was discharged from the hospital. Immediately post-transplant, the patient's methadone was 100 mg daily.
In June 2001, the patient showed biopsy proven recurrent HCV in the transplanted liver. There were no signs of rejection. The patient was continuing MMT ~80 mg daily and was compliant with his immunosuppressive therapy and transplant follow up care. In January 2002, the patient began HCV treatment using an escalating regimen of INF combined with RBV. He reached full dose INF (3 MIU three times per week) and RBV (1200 mg daily) at approximately 10 weeks of treatment. The intention was to treat for 48 weeks on combination therapy. The patient started treatment with a low viral load (410,760 IU/mL). At approximately six months of therapy, he was HCV-RNA quantitatively virus negative.
Overall, the patient had common side effects to the combination therapy. His physical symptoms included fatigue, nausea, headaches, and flu-like symptoms. These side effects were treated symptomatically and either resolved or were well-tolerated. Although the patient was taking immunosuppressive drugs throughout his HCV therapy, his white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts remained stable. By treatment week 12, he did experience significant hemolytic anemia (Hgb 10.7 g/dL) and was started on 40,000 units per week of erythropoietin. The patient's RBV was reduced to 800 mg daily for two weeks and then was increased to 1000 mg daily for the remainder of treatment.
Due to a history of anxiety and mood disorders, the patient was started on low dose antidepressants, citalopram 10 mg daily, three months prior to starting treatment. Additionally, the patient experienced psychiatric side effects to IFN/RBV including mood swings, angry outbursts, insomnia, and forgetfulness. His citalopram, 10 mg daily, was increased twice (20 mg daily at week 12 and 40 mg daily at week 40). Quetiapine, 25 mg 1–2 tabs daily, and bupropion, 150 mg twice daily, were also added halfway through treatment to further control these psychiatric side effects. These additional psychotropic medications were managed in conjunction with the patient's methadone clinic; during treatment the patient's methadone was gradually increased from 84 mg daily to a maximum of 110 mg daily.

695,1797165-1,17239254,oa_comm/PMC001xxxxxx/PMC1797165.xml,Distraction osteogenesis in a severe mandibular deficiency,"A 23-year old male patient who had severe mandibular hypoplasia referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery for treatment. His main complaints were unaesthetic appearance, snoring, wheezing, and difficulties during respiration, speech, and chewing.
In the extraoral examination, severely convex profile with a receding chin and a prominent nose was observed. Intraoral examination revealed a Class II Division I malocclusion with an excessive overjet. Maxillary arch had a triangular form. Right lateral incisor was missing, mild rotation of the left central incisor, palatoversion of the left lateral incisor and buccoversion of the left canine were observed due to arch length deficiency. Lower second premolars, first and second molars were missing at both sides and first premolar was also absent at left side. Mesial tipping of right and left third molars was observed due to missing of the adjacent teeth (Figure , , and ).
To determine the skeletal deformity, cephalometric analysis and measurements on stereolithographic three dimensional skull prototype model obtained through three dimensional computerized tomographic images of the patient were used. The stereolithographic model was built by Spectrum Z510 Color 3D Printers (Z Corporation-Burlington, USA).
Cephalometric analysis indicated severe skeletal Class II discrepancy confirmed by an ANB of 13°. Point A and point B were 6 mm and 42 mm behind the nasion vertical (NV), respectively. These norms supported each other and revealed that the patient had a severely retruded mandible. Ramus length (Ar-Go) was 41 mm and corpus length (Go-Gn) was 49 mm revealing deficiency of both ramus and corpus. Increases in the mandibular plane, gonial angle and Y-axis emphasized the posterior rotation of the mandible. The anterior facial height was 129 mm, posterior facial height was 64 mm and the ratio of these values was 49.61 % revealing that the patient had a long face. Overjet and overbite were measured as 15 mm and 4 mm, respectively. The cephalometric landmarks used in our report are demonstrated in Figures , and and the pre and post treatment measurements of the cephalograms are presented in Table .
Ramus and corpus lengths were also measured on the stereolithographic models. The preoperative distance between condyle and gonion was 50 mm and the distance between gonion and menton was 69 mm for the right side. They were 44 mm and 68 mm, respectively for the left side. The patient had severe mandibular hypoplasia due to inadequate ramus and corpus length, therefore using an extraoral multiplanar distractor was inevitable. Tritrac® External Distractor (Ucmed Medical Ltd. Co.-Ankara, Turkey) was used for the treatment of the presented case.
Preadjusted appliances (0.018 × 0.022 inch) were placed in the maxillary and mandibular arch and open coil spring was used to open space for the left lateral incisor. Following the leveling phase, 0.016 × 0.022 inch arch wires were placed on the upper and lower teeth.
Because of the limitation of the mouth opening, nasotracheal intubation was performed with fiberoptic bronchoscope. Under general anaesthesia, after completing the intraoral incisions and exposing the cortex of mandibular corpus and ramus on both sides, the device was secured to the mandible via 6 percutaneous pins. This system had 3 pairs of pins to be secured; one pair to the ramus, the other to the angulus and the last one to the corpus region inferior to the mandibular canal. During this procedure extraoral incisions and trochar were used. The mandibular osteotomy was then performed with round and fissure burs and osteotomes. Two osteotomies on each ipsilateral side were planned. One of the osteotomies was on the ramus and the other one was anterior to the second molar. After the completion of the osteotomies, the distractors were tested and were placed paralell to each other. Then, the incisions were primarily closed.
A 7 days of latency phase was waited for callus formation. Afterwards, distraction was performed at a rate of 0.5 mm, twice a day. Ramus was distracted for 7 days and corpus was distracted for 45 days. While the corpus was being distracted, the angles of distractors were reduced 5° on days 10, 20, 30, 40 so as to decrease the gonial angle. Paralellization of the distractors were protected during this procedure. Once the desired bone length had been acquired, 3 months of consolidation was allowed. Following the consolidation phase the distractor was removed under local anaesthesia and the extraoral wounds were debrided and primarily closed and left for recovery.
The patient used class II intraoral elastics at night time in order to prevent relapse and elastic traction was completed after 3 months. The patient was followed-up for one more month in order to determine whether relapse would occur. Brackets were debonded 4 months after consolidation period. The total treatment time was 14 months.
Finally the prosthetic rehabilitations of the missing teeth in the mandible were solved with stationary restorations.","[[23.0, 'year']]",M,2007,"['mandibular', 'Oral', 'Maxillofacial', 'extraoral', 'chin', 'nose', 'Intraoral', 'Maxillary arch', 'Right lateral incisor', 'left central incisor', 'left lateral incisor', 'left canine', 'arch', 'Lower second premolars', 'first and second molars', 'first premolar', 'right and left third molars', 'adjacent teeth', 'skeletal', 'skull', 'skeletal', 'ANB', 'Point A', 'point B', 'behind the nasion vertical (NV)', 'mandible', 'Ramus', 'corpus', 'ramus', 'corpus', 'mandibular plane', 'gonial angle', 'posterior rotation of the mandible', 'anterior facial', 'posterior facial', 'face', 'Ramus', 'corpus', 'condyle', 'gonion', 'gonion', 'menton', 'mandibular', 'ramus', 'corpus', 'extraoral', 'maxillary', 'mandibular arch', 'left lateral incisor', 'mouth', 'cortex of mandibular corpus', 'cortex of mandibular corpus and ramus on both sides', 'ramus', 'mandible', 'percutaneous', 'ramus', 'angulus', 'corpus region inferior to the mandibular canal', 'mandibular', 'ramus', 'anterior to the second molar', 'Ramus', 'corpus', 'corpus', 'gonial angle', 'bone', 'extraoral', 'teeth', 'mandible']","['mandibular hypoplasia', 'unaesthetic appearance', 'snoring', 'wheezing', 'difficulties during respiration, speech, and chewing', 'convex profile', 'receding chin', 'prominent nose', 'malocclusion', 'overjet', 'triangular form', 'Right lateral incisor was missing', 'rotation of the left central incisor', 'palatoversion of the left lateral incisor', 'buccoversion', 'buccoversion of the left canine', 'arch length deficiency', 'missing at both sides', 'absent at left side', 'Mesial tipping of right and left third molars', 'missing of the adjacent teeth', 'skeletal deformity', 'discrepancy', 'retruded mandible', 'deficiency', 'Increases in the mandibular plane', 'gonial angle and Y-axis', 'emphasized the posterior rotation of the mandible', 'anterior facial height', 'posterior facial height', 'long face', 'mandibular hypoplasia', 'inadequate ramus and corpus length', 'latency phase', 'callus formation', 'Paralellization of the distractors', 'extraoral wounds', 'relapse', 'missing teeth']",[],"['23-year', 'Burlington, USA', 'Ankara']","['Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery', 'treatment', 'Intraoral examination', 'cephalometric analysis', 'stereolithographic three dimensional skull prototype model', 'three dimensional computerized tomographic images', 'Cephalometric analysis', 'ANB', 'Ramus length', 'corpus length', 'anterior facial height', 'posterior facial height', 'ratio', 'Overjet', 'overbite', 'cephalograms', 'stereolithographic', 'distance between condyle and gonion', 'distance between gonion and menton', 'using an extraoral multiplanar distractor', 'extraoral multiplanar distractor', 'Tritrac® External Distractor', 'open coil spring was used to open space for the left lateral incisor', 'nasotracheal intubation', 'nasotracheal intubation was performed with fiberoptic bronchoscope', 'general anaesthesia', 'completing the intraoral incisions and exposing the cortex of mandibular corpus and ramus on both sides, the device was secured to the mandible via 6 percutaneous pins', 'system had 3 pairs of pins to be secured; one pair to the ramus, the other to the angulus and the last one to the corpus region inferior to the mandibular canal', 'procedure extraoral incisions and trochar', 'mandibular osteotomy', 'mandibular osteotomy was then performed with round and fissure burs and osteotomes', 'Two osteotomies on each ipsilateral side', 'One of the osteotomies was on the ramus and the other one was anterior to the second molar', 'osteotomies', 'distractors were tested', 'distractors were tested and were placed paralell to each other', 'incisions were primarily closed', 'distraction was performed at a rate of 0.5 mm, twice a day', 'Ramus was distracted', 'corpus was distracted', 'angles of distractors were reduced 5°', 'procedure', 'consolidation', 'distractor was removed under local anaesthesia', 'local anaesthesia', 'extraoral wounds were debrided and primarily closed', 'class II intraoral elastics', 'elastic traction', 'Brackets', 'Brackets were debonded', 'treatment', 'prosthetic rehabilitations of the missing teeth in the mandible were solved with stationary restorations']","['7 days', 'on days 10, 20, 30, 40', '4 months']"

Liver biopsy was performed on all but one case (case 2) in December 2001 (). The pathologic findings showed diffuse spotty hepatocytic necrosis. The portal tracts were slightly enlarged, and inflammatory infiltration was present in all cases. Clumped Kupffer cells containing periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive material were abundant, especially around the terminal hepatic venule (). These findings were compatible with the remission stage of acute hepatitis and also with toxic hepatitis. Wide periportal necrosis was also identified in cases 1 and 4 (), and necrosis was found in the central-to-portal or portal-to-portal region, with bridging necrosis in all cases (). In case 4, regenerative nodules were present, suggesting the development of cirrhosis. Cholestasis and fatty changes were also evident in cases 4 and 3, respectively.
