The defect was estimated to be 10 mm wide on TTE with evidence of right atrial and right ventricular dilatation. Left atrial size was normal. She was referred was further investigation and treatment. Cardiac catheterisation demonstrated a pulmonary to systemic flow shunt of four to one. Peri-procedure TEE revealed that there were two defects; one measuring 24 mm located inferiorly between the inferior vena cava and coronary sinus os with the second defect situated superiorly and measuring 30 mm. The inferior defect was closed using a 24 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose was 403. The patient was discharged the following day and readmitted three months later for closure of the superior defect. This was performed using a 30 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. The procedure was technical difficult as after deployment of the left sided disc, the device initially lay obliquely in the defect. The final position was satisfactory with no evidence of intra-cardiac shunting (figure ). There was no interference between the two devices and mitral valve function remained normal. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the second procedure was 727. The patient remained well and at six month follow-up there was no evidence of residual shunt.\",\n          \"A 60 year old woman presented with a small swelling beneath the right ear lobe of 4 months duration. The swelling measured 2 \\u00d7 1 cm placed in the superficial part of the parotid and was not fixed. There was no facial nerve palsy or palpable cervical nodes. A fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was carried out which showed the lesion to be ACC []. The clinical staging was T1, N0, M0. The patient underwent a total conservative parotidectomy after metastatic work up. Histopathology revealed ACC with cribriform pattern and perineural invasion (Figure ). 60 Gy adjuvant external beam radiotherapy was administered post-operatively to the parotid area and the neck. Patient was placed on regular follow-up. Three years after primary surgery, patient presented with heaviness and pain in the right hypochondrium of 15 days duration. Patient was anicteric and abdominal examination revealed firm nodular and non tender enlargement of the liver. There was no ascites. Surgical site and neck were clinically normal. Chest roentgenogram was normal. Ultrasonography (US) of the abdomen revealed multiple metastatic lesions scattered in both lobes (Figure ). Liver function tests were normal and an US guided FNAC revealed metastatic ACC (Figure ). Since the lesions were multiple and scattered over both lobes of liver, surgical option was not considered and the patient was offered palliative chemotherapy which she declined. She developed pedal edema and abdominal distention 20 months after detection of liver metastasis. On clinical examination, patient was anicteric but liver had increased in size and abdomen showed evidence of a little free fluid. Chest CT scan was normal. Bone scan did not suggest any metastatic focus. Patient died a month later still without evidence of local recurrence or pulmonary metastasis.\",\n          \"A 30-year old woman was investigated for palpitations and a secundum ASD of approximately 20 mm was diagnosed. TEE suggested that the atrial septum was fenestrated with a small inferior rim of tissue and she was referred for device closure. At cardiac catheterisation it became clear that there were two principal defects, one in the fossa ovalis and the other situated inferior and posterior between the fossa ovalis and the coronary sinus. The superior hole was closed with a 16 mm Amplatzer septal occluder but failed to cover the inferior defect. A 15 mm Amplatzer septal occluder device was subsequently placed successfully across the inferior defect with a stable position (figure ). Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the procedure was 124. Subsequent follow-up revealed a small left to right shunt between the two septal occluders but further intervention was not considered necessary.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"age\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[[31.0, 'year']]\",\n          \"[[60.0, 'year']]\",\n          \"[[30.0, 'year']]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"M\",\n          \"F\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pub_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2004\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He had a past history of hypertension and hypomania. He was single and he lived alone. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 80/63 mm of Hg, heart rate 126/minute, and temperature 102\\u00b0F. He was awake but unable to speak due to a mixed receptive and expressive aphasia. He had right homonymous hemianopsia and hemiplegia. Cardiac examination was positive for a pansystolic murmur in the apical area. The abdominal examination was unremarkable. On rectal examination there was perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone. Complete blood count showed WBC 15,400/mm3 with a left shift, hematocrit 49%, and normal platelets. Serum chemistries showed glucose 84 mg/dl, albumin 2.9 mg/dl, and calcium 8.5 mg/dl. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain, including diffusion weighted imaging, revealed acute hemorrhagic infarction of the left occipital lobe and acute embolic infarctions of the left frontal and right occipital lobes (Fig and ). Transesophageal Echocardiogram demonstrated mitral regurgitation and large vegetations on the posterior leaf of the mitral valve. Splenic and renal infarcts were visible on Computerized Tomography of the abdomen. All of the blood culture bottles and the urine culture grew methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment of the bacterial endocarditis was started with intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin. The patient had a significant recovery of speech and motor function within a few days. When asked about recent dental work, he gave a history of a tooth extraction 2\\u20133 days before the hospitalization but was unable to provide information about his dentist. A dentist from the hospital examined the patient and found no clinical evidence of the extraction. The patient underwent a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation. He displayed confabulation and perseverance (marriage, retirement, hospitalization were reported using the same date which was his birthday). He also had significant executive dysfunction including concrete thinking and poor insight regarding his health and cognitive problems. On hospital day 12 the patient had mitral valve replacement surgery using a bioprosthetic valve. He completed a six-week course of intravenous antibiotic treatment. He also underwent extensive rehabilitation therapy and was sent home after 8 weeks of hospitalization. On subsequent follow-up visits the patient showed complete recovery from the stroke and was back to his baseline. In response to questions about his sexual history the patient indicated having heterosexual relations with multiple partners. However, his answers were inconsistent and seemed unreliable.\\nA closer examination of his medical records revealed that two years prior to this hospitalization, the patient was admitted with a plastic soda bottle retained in the rectosigmoid for 3 days. The bottle had been filled with warm water and inserted into his anal canal for sexual stimulation. It slipped all the way into the rectum and could not be retrieved. His attempts to extract it at home were unsuccessful. In the emergency room his physical examination was normal except for a palpable mass in the suprapubic area, decreased anal sphincter tone and a dilated rectal vault. On X-ray of the abdomen, the outline of a plastic bottle was visible in the rectosigmoid (Fig ). The patient was taken to the operating room and under spinal anesthesia the bottle was extracted. He had multiple lacerations of the rectal mucosa but there was no perforation. He went home the next day. On follow-up visits to primary care he was noted to be overall healthy except having mild hypertension. His behavior was indicative of hypomania, but he did not get a formal psychiatric evaluation.\\nForeign bodies in the rectum and methods of their extraction have been amply chronicled in the surgical literature []. Sexual stimulation is the reason in a majority of these cases []. Local trauma, perforation, and resultant peritonitis are well known complications []. An unlimited PUBMED search for articles on bacteremia or endocarditis related to rectal foreign body insertion was unfruitful (We tried MeSH terms anal/rectal/colorectal/foreign bodies/anorectal /sexual deviation for the purpose). Bacteremia and septicemia from barium enema [], and therapeutic anal dilatation [] have been published. Procedures like fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy are known to cause endocarditis [], but septic stroke resulting from endocarditis related to lower gastrointestinal instrumentation has also not been reported.\\nThe patient's history of anorectal insertion of a plastic soda bottle for sexual gratification is consistent with published reports of use of large objects for this purpose []. The resultant rectal trauma can easily lead to bacteremia. Rectal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is well documented and is a potential source of infection []. This organism tends to be more abundant on the rectal mucosa than within the feces []. In a study of gastrointestinal colonization, Staphylococcus aureus grew from the culture of rectal swabs in 60% cases versus 53% positive culture of nasal swabs taken from the same subjects []. This organism is known to cause endocarditis of normal heart valves [,]. Neurologic complications of infective endocarditis, particularly embolic events, tend to be higher in cases of endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus [].\\nIt is known that few patients with rectal foreign bodies will freely admit to transanal introduction []. This explains to some extent the paucity of literature linking this practice with bacteremia or endocarditis. We believe our patient was habituated to rectal insertion of foreign bodies and that is evident from his previous history along with the clinical findings of perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone []. In the absence of a reliable history from the patient, the link between endocarditis and rectal trauma in this case is based on circumstantial evidence. A further study of patients with well-documented evidence of rectal foreign body insertion could be the next step to explore this important observation.\",\n          \"A 66-year-old female was admitted to our Institution with a history of a painless left preauricular nodule that had gradually increased in size. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a 2 \\u00d7 2.5 cm solid lesion in the left parotid gland. Cervical and peri-aortic lymph nodes were not enlarged, except for one in the submandibular region.\\nTotal parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve was performed. Thus, the parotid gland and covering skin were removed. Lateral jugular lymph nodes dissection was carried out.\\nThe lesion was initially examined in frozen sections. The specimen was submitted for histology and after fixation in formalin solution and inclusion in paraffin, 3\\u20135 \\u03bcm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for conventional evaluation and a Periodic acid Schiff stain also carried out. A panel of immunostains, including antibodies against mitochondrial antigen, keratin (Citok AE1, Citok AE3), carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA), vimentin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, smooth muscle actin and S-100, was applied to representative sections of the tumour using the avidin-biotin complex technique (Table ). Formalin-fixed small fragments of neoplasm were also examined by electron microscopy, after washing in 0,1 M phosphate buffer, postfixation in osmium tetroxide, dehydratation in ethanol and embedding in epon-araldite.\\nUltrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips EM 208 electronic microscope.\",\n          \"A 47 year old man presented to the Emergency department with central chest pain. Lateral myocardial infarction (MI) was confirmed by typical changes in leads I, AVL and V6 and raised troponin T levels. The patient was not thombolysed. He was haemodynamically stable initially and a coronary angiogram was contemplated. However, before this could be performed, he developed further chest pain and became haemodynamically unstable with tachycardia, hypotension and collapse (at 48 hours). An urgent trans- thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a pericardial effusion. Left ventricular (LV) free wall rupture was suspected. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed which confirmed this, as well as a large pericardial effusion (figure ). He was transferred from the referring hospital to the nearest cardiothoracic centre (one hour journey) for surgical repair. On arrival, it was felt that he would not have survived a trip to the catheter lab. A peri-operative trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) demonstrated pericardial tamponade and left ventricular free wall rupture in the region supplied by the circumflex artery. Surgery was performed via a median sternotomy. A large amount of blood and clot was removed from the pericardium with immediate haemodynamic improvement. A large recent infarction was identified involving the obtuse margin of the heart. This part of the myocardium was typically oedematous and fragile. At the centre of the infarcted area blood spurted from a small hole in the left ventricular free wall. The pericardium was sutured bilaterally to the skin edges and the heart was gently lifted placing large swabs behind it for surgical exposure. Surgery was performed on the beating heart without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The LV wall defect was repaired with Gelatine-Resorcin-Formalin (GRF glue: Cardial, Saint-Etienne, France) applied to a 6 cm diameter bovine pericardial patch (Impra, Tempe, Arizona, USA). This sutureless technique was repeated four times using overlapping patches of bovine pericardium to ensure coverage of the surrounding infarcted area of the left ventricular free wall. After ensuring adequate hemostasis, the heart was replaced into the pericardial sac. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP, Datascope, Oakland, NJ, USA) was inserted electively after the procedure to reduce cardiac after-load. Post-operatively, the patient returned to the intensive therapy unit in a stable condition without inotropic support. The patient was successfully extubated twelve hours post-operatively and remained haemodynamically stable. Loss from the chest drains was modest (440 mls in 24 hours). The IABP was removed two days after surgery. The rest of the post-operative course was uneventful. There was no evidence of end-organ injury. A pre-discharge trans-thoracic echocardiogram did not show any leak of blood across the ventricular repair. There was minimal pericardial effusion and moderate left ventricular ejection fraction with no valvular abnormalities. The patient was discharged home on the fifth post-operative day. Subsequent investigation with coronary angiogram and magnetic resonance imaging scan have shown complete occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery. Irregularities were seen in the left anterior and right coronary arteries but there were no significant stenoses in these vessels. The obtuse margin of the heart was akinetic and the left ventricle was dilated with overall moderate function. At eighteen month follow up the patient is clinically well being active and experiencing only mild dyspnoea on exertion (NYHA II).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"age\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 93,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[[77.0, 'year']]\",\n          \"[[44.0, 'year']]\",\n          \"[[5.0, 'year']]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"M\",\n          \"F\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He had a past history of hypertension and hypomania. He was single and he lived alone. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 80/63 mm of Hg, heart rate 126/minute, and temperature 102\\u00b0F. He was awake but unable to speak due to a mixed receptive and expressive aphasia. He had right homonymous hemianopsia and hemiplegia. Cardiac examination was positive for a pansystolic murmur in the apical area. The abdominal examination was unremarkable. On rectal examination there was perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone. Complete blood count showed WBC 15,400/mm3 with a left shift, hematocrit 49%, and normal platelets. Serum chemistries showed glucose 84 mg/dl, albumin 2.9 mg/dl, and calcium 8.5 mg/dl. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain, including diffusion weighted imaging, revealed acute hemorrhagic infarction of the left occipital lobe and acute embolic infarctions of the left frontal and right occipital lobes (Fig and ). Transesophageal Echocardiogram demonstrated mitral regurgitation and large vegetations on the posterior leaf of the mitral valve. Splenic and renal infarcts were visible on Computerized Tomography of the abdomen. All of the blood culture bottles and the urine culture grew methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment of the bacterial endocarditis was started with intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin. The patient had a significant recovery of speech and motor function within a few days. When asked about recent dental work, he gave a history of a tooth extraction 2\\u20133 days before the hospitalization but was unable to provide information about his dentist. A dentist from the hospital examined the patient and found no clinical evidence of the extraction. The patient underwent a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation. He displayed confabulation and perseverance (marriage, retirement, hospitalization were reported using the same date which was his birthday). He also had significant executive dysfunction including concrete thinking and poor insight regarding his health and cognitive problems. On hospital day 12 the patient had mitral valve replacement surgery using a bioprosthetic valve. He completed a six-week course of intravenous antibiotic treatment. He also underwent extensive rehabilitation therapy and was sent home after 8 weeks of hospitalization. On subsequent follow-up visits the patient showed complete recovery from the stroke and was back to his baseline. In response to questions about his sexual history the patient indicated having heterosexual relations with multiple partners. However, his answers were inconsistent and seemed unreliable.\\nA closer examination of his medical records revealed that two years prior to this hospitalization, the patient was admitted with a plastic soda bottle retained in the rectosigmoid for 3 days. The bottle had been filled with warm water and inserted into his anal canal for sexual stimulation. It slipped all the way into the rectum and could not be retrieved. His attempts to extract it at home were unsuccessful. In the emergency room his physical examination was normal except for a palpable mass in the suprapubic area, decreased anal sphincter tone and a dilated rectal vault. On X-ray of the abdomen, the outline of a plastic bottle was visible in the rectosigmoid (Fig ). The patient was taken to the operating room and under spinal anesthesia the bottle was extracted. He had multiple lacerations of the rectal mucosa but there was no perforation. He went home the next day. On follow-up visits to primary care he was noted to be overall healthy except having mild hypertension. His behavior was indicative of hypomania, but he did not get a formal psychiatric evaluation.\\nForeign bodies in the rectum and methods of their extraction have been amply chronicled in the surgical literature []. Sexual stimulation is the reason in a majority of these cases []. Local trauma, perforation, and resultant peritonitis are well known complications []. An unlimited PUBMED search for articles on bacteremia or endocarditis related to rectal foreign body insertion was unfruitful (We tried MeSH terms anal/rectal/colorectal/foreign bodies/anorectal /sexual deviation for the purpose). Bacteremia and septicemia from barium enema [], and therapeutic anal dilatation [] have been published. Procedures like fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy are known to cause endocarditis [], but septic stroke resulting from endocarditis related to lower gastrointestinal instrumentation has also not been reported.\\nThe patient's history of anorectal insertion of a plastic soda bottle for sexual gratification is consistent with published reports of use of large objects for this purpose []. The resultant rectal trauma can easily lead to bacteremia. Rectal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is well documented and is a potential source of infection []. This organism tends to be more abundant on the rectal mucosa than within the feces []. In a study of gastrointestinal colonization, Staphylococcus aureus grew from the culture of rectal swabs in 60% cases versus 53% positive culture of nasal swabs taken from the same subjects []. This organism is known to cause endocarditis of normal heart valves [,]. Neurologic complications of infective endocarditis, particularly embolic events, tend to be higher in cases of endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus [].\\nIt is known that few patients with rectal foreign bodies will freely admit to transanal introduction []. This explains to some extent the paucity of literature linking this practice with bacteremia or endocarditis. We believe our patient was habituated to rectal insertion of foreign bodies and that is evident from his previous history along with the clinical findings of perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone []. In the absence of a reliable history from the patient, the link between endocarditis and rectal trauma in this case is based on circumstantial evidence. A further study of patients with well-documented evidence of rectal foreign body insertion could be the next step to explore this important observation.\",\n          \"A 66-year-old female was admitted to our Institution with a history of a painless left preauricular nodule that had gradually increased in size. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a 2 \\u00d7 2.5 cm solid lesion in the left parotid gland. Cervical and peri-aortic lymph nodes were not enlarged, except for one in the submandibular region.\\nTotal parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve was performed. Thus, the parotid gland and covering skin were removed. Lateral jugular lymph nodes dissection was carried out.\\nThe lesion was initially examined in frozen sections. The specimen was submitted for histology and after fixation in formalin solution and inclusion in paraffin, 3\\u20135 \\u03bcm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for conventional evaluation and a Periodic acid Schiff stain also carried out. A panel of immunostains, including antibodies against mitochondrial antigen, keratin (Citok AE1, Citok AE3), carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA), vimentin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, smooth muscle actin and S-100, was applied to representative sections of the tumour using the avidin-biotin complex technique (Table ). Formalin-fixed small fragments of neoplasm were also examined by electron microscopy, after washing in 0,1 M phosphate buffer, postfixation in osmium tetroxide, dehydratation in ethanol and embedding in epon-araldite.\\nUltrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips EM 208 electronic microscope.\",\n          \"A 47 year old man presented to the Emergency department with central chest pain. Lateral myocardial infarction (MI) was confirmed by typical changes in leads I, AVL and V6 and raised troponin T levels. The patient was not thombolysed. He was haemodynamically stable initially and a coronary angiogram was contemplated. However, before this could be performed, he developed further chest pain and became haemodynamically unstable with tachycardia, hypotension and collapse (at 48 hours). An urgent trans- thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a pericardial effusion. Left ventricular (LV) free wall rupture was suspected. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed which confirmed this, as well as a large pericardial effusion (figure ). He was transferred from the referring hospital to the nearest cardiothoracic centre (one hour journey) for surgical repair. On arrival, it was felt that he would not have survived a trip to the catheter lab. A peri-operative trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) demonstrated pericardial tamponade and left ventricular free wall rupture in the region supplied by the circumflex artery. Surgery was performed via a median sternotomy. A large amount of blood and clot was removed from the pericardium with immediate haemodynamic improvement. A large recent infarction was identified involving the obtuse margin of the heart. This part of the myocardium was typically oedematous and fragile. At the centre of the infarcted area blood spurted from a small hole in the left ventricular free wall. The pericardium was sutured bilaterally to the skin edges and the heart was gently lifted placing large swabs behind it for surgical exposure. Surgery was performed on the beating heart without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The LV wall defect was repaired with Gelatine-Resorcin-Formalin (GRF glue: Cardial, Saint-Etienne, France) applied to a 6 cm diameter bovine pericardial patch (Impra, Tempe, Arizona, USA). This sutureless technique was repeated four times using overlapping patches of bovine pericardium to ensure coverage of the surrounding infarcted area of the left ventricular free wall. After ensuring adequate hemostasis, the heart was replaced into the pericardial sac. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP, Datascope, Oakland, NJ, USA) was inserted electively after the procedure to reduce cardiac after-load. Post-operatively, the patient returned to the intensive therapy unit in a stable condition without inotropic support. The patient was successfully extubated twelve hours post-operatively and remained haemodynamically stable. Loss from the chest drains was modest (440 mls in 24 hours). The IABP was removed two days after surgery. The rest of the post-operative course was uneventful. There was no evidence of end-organ injury. A pre-discharge trans-thoracic echocardiogram did not show any leak of blood across the ventricular repair. There was minimal pericardial effusion and moderate left ventricular ejection fraction with no valvular abnormalities. The patient was discharged home on the fifth post-operative day. Subsequent investigation with coronary angiogram and magnetic resonance imaging scan have shown complete occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery. Irregularities were seen in the left anterior and right coronary arteries but there were no significant stenoses in these vessels. The obtuse margin of the heart was akinetic and the left ventricle was dilated with overall moderate function. At eighteen month follow up the patient is clinically well being active and experiencing only mild dyspnoea on exertion (NYHA II).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

He had a past history of hypertension and hypomania. He was single and he lived alone. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 80/63 mm of Hg, heart rate 126/minute, and temperature 102\\u00b0F. He was awake but unable to speak due to a mixed receptive and expressive aphasia. He had right homonymous hemianopsia and hemiplegia. Cardiac examination was positive for a pansystolic murmur in the apical area. The abdominal examination was unremarkable. On rectal examination there was perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone. Complete blood count showed WBC 15,400/mm3 with a left shift, hematocrit 49%, and normal platelets. Serum chemistries showed glucose 84 mg/dl, albumin 2.9 mg/dl, and calcium 8.5 mg/dl. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain, including diffusion weighted imaging, revealed acute hemorrhagic infarction of the left occipital lobe and acute embolic infarctions of the left frontal and right occipital lobes (Fig and ). Transesophageal Echocardiogram demonstrated mitral regurgitation and large vegetations on the posterior leaf of the mitral valve. Splenic and renal infarcts were visible on Computerized Tomography of the abdomen. All of the blood culture bottles and the urine culture grew methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment of the bacterial endocarditis was started with intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin. The patient had a significant recovery of speech and motor function within a few days. When asked about recent dental work, he gave a history of a tooth extraction 2\\u20133 days before the hospitalization but was unable to provide information about his dentist. A dentist from the hospital examined the patient and found no clinical evidence of the extraction. The patient underwent a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation. He displayed confabulation and perseverance (marriage, retirement, hospitalization were reported using the same date which was his birthday). He also had significant executive dysfunction including concrete thinking and poor insight regarding his health and cognitive problems. On hospital day 12 the patient had mitral valve replacement surgery using a bioprosthetic valve. He completed a six-week course of intravenous antibiotic treatment. He also underwent extensive rehabilitation therapy and was sent home after 8 weeks of hospitalization. On subsequent follow-up visits the patient showed complete recovery from the stroke and was back to his baseline. In response to questions about his sexual history the patient indicated having heterosexual relations with multiple partners. However, his answers were inconsistent and seemed unreliable.\\nA closer examination of his medical records revealed that two years prior to this hospitalization, the patient was admitted with a plastic soda bottle retained in the rectosigmoid for 3 days. The bottle had been filled with warm water and inserted into his anal canal for sexual stimulation. It slipped all the way into the rectum and could not be retrieved. His attempts to extract it at home were unsuccessful. In the emergency room his physical examination was normal except for a palpable mass in the suprapubic area, decreased anal sphincter tone and a dilated rectal vault. On X-ray of the abdomen, the outline of a plastic bottle was visible in the rectosigmoid (Fig ). The patient was taken to the operating room and under spinal anesthesia the bottle was extracted. He had multiple lacerations of the rectal mucosa but there was no perforation. He went home the next day. On follow-up visits to primary care he was noted to be overall healthy except having mild hypertension. His behavior was indicative of hypomania, but he did not get a formal psychiatric evaluation.\\nForeign bodies in the rectum and methods of their extraction have been amply chronicled in the surgical literature []. Sexual stimulation is the reason in a majority of these cases []. Local trauma, perforation, and resultant peritonitis are well known complications []. An unlimited PUBMED search for articles on bacteremia or endocarditis related to rectal foreign body insertion was unfruitful (We tried MeSH terms anal/rectal/colorectal/foreign bodies/anorectal /sexual deviation for the purpose). Bacteremia and septicemia from barium enema [], and therapeutic anal dilatation [] have been published. Procedures like fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy are known to cause endocarditis [], but septic stroke resulting from endocarditis related to lower gastrointestinal instrumentation has also not been reported.\\nThe patient's history of anorectal insertion of a plastic soda bottle for sexual gratification is consistent with published reports of use of large objects for this purpose []. The resultant rectal trauma can easily lead to bacteremia. Rectal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is well documented and is a potential source of infection []. This organism tends to be more abundant on the rectal mucosa than within the feces []. In a study of gastrointestinal colonization, Staphylococcus aureus grew from the culture of rectal swabs in 60% cases versus 53% positive culture of nasal swabs taken from the same subjects []. This organism is known to cause endocarditis of normal heart valves [,]. Neurologic complications of infective endocarditis, particularly embolic events, tend to be higher in cases of endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus [].\\nIt is known that few patients with rectal foreign bodies will freely admit to transanal introduction []. This explains to some extent the paucity of literature linking this practice with bacteremia or endocarditis. We believe our patient was habituated to rectal insertion of foreign bodies and that is evident from his previous history along with the clinical findings of perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone []. In the absence of a reliable history from the patient, the link between endocarditis and rectal trauma in this case is based on circumstantial evidence. A further study of patients with well-documented evidence of rectal foreign body insertion could be the next step to explore this important observation.\",\n          \"A 66-year-old female was admitted to our Institution with a history of a painless left preauricular nodule that had gradually increased in size. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a 2 \\u00d7 2.5 cm solid lesion in the left parotid gland. Cervical and peri-aortic lymph nodes were not enlarged, except for one in the submandibular region.\\nTotal parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve was performed. Thus, the parotid gland and covering skin were removed. Lateral jugular lymph nodes dissection was carried out.\\nThe lesion was initially examined in frozen sections. The specimen was submitted for histology and after fixation in formalin solution and inclusion in paraffin, 3\\u20135 \\u03bcm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for conventional evaluation and a Periodic acid Schiff stain also carried out. A panel of immunostains, including antibodies against mitochondrial antigen, keratin (Citok AE1, Citok AE3), carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA), vimentin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, smooth muscle actin and S-100, was applied to representative sections of the tumour using the avidin-biotin complex technique (Table ). Formalin-fixed small fragments of neoplasm were also examined by electron microscopy, after washing in 0,1 M phosphate buffer, postfixation in osmium tetroxide, dehydratation in ethanol and embedding in epon-araldite.\\nUltrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips EM 208 electronic microscope.\",\n          \"A 47 year old man presented to the Emergency department with central chest pain. Lateral myocardial infarction (MI) was confirmed by typical changes in leads I, AVL and V6 and raised troponin T levels. The patient was not thombolysed. He was haemodynamically stable initially and a coronary angiogram was contemplated. However, before this could be performed, he developed further chest pain and became haemodynamically unstable with tachycardia, hypotension and collapse (at 48 hours). An urgent trans- thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a pericardial effusion. Left ventricular (LV) free wall rupture was suspected. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed which confirmed this, as well as a large pericardial effusion (figure ). He was transferred from the referring hospital to the nearest cardiothoracic centre (one hour journey) for surgical repair. On arrival, it was felt that he would not have survived a trip to the catheter lab. A peri-operative trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) demonstrated pericardial tamponade and left ventricular free wall rupture in the region supplied by the circumflex artery. Surgery was performed via a median sternotomy. A large amount of blood and clot was removed from the pericardium with immediate haemodynamic improvement. A large recent infarction was identified involving the obtuse margin of the heart. This part of the myocardium was typically oedematous and fragile. At the centre of the infarcted area blood spurted from a small hole in the left ventricular free wall. The pericardium was sutured bilaterally to the skin edges and the heart was gently lifted placing large swabs behind it for surgical exposure. Surgery was performed on the beating heart without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The LV wall defect was repaired with Gelatine-Resorcin-Formalin (GRF glue: Cardial, Saint-Etienne, France) applied to a 6 cm diameter bovine pericardial patch (Impra, Tempe, Arizona, USA). This sutureless technique was repeated four times using overlapping patches of bovine pericardium to ensure coverage of the surrounding infarcted area of the left ventricular free wall. After ensuring adequate hemostasis, the heart was replaced into the pericardial sac. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP, Datascope, Oakland, NJ, USA) was inserted electively after the procedure to reduce cardiac after-load. Post-operatively, the patient returned to the intensive therapy unit in a stable condition without inotropic support. The patient was successfully extubated twelve hours post-operatively and remained haemodynamically stable. Loss from the chest drains was modest (440 mls in 24 hours). The IABP was removed two days after surgery. The rest of the post-operative course was uneventful. There was no evidence of end-organ injury. A pre-discharge trans-thoracic echocardiogram did not show any leak of blood across the ventricular repair. There was minimal pericardial effusion and moderate left ventricular ejection fraction with no valvular abnormalities. The patient was discharged home on the fifth post-operative day. Subsequent investigation with coronary angiogram and magnetic resonance imaging scan have shown complete occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery. Irregularities were seen in the left anterior and right coronary arteries but there were no significant stenoses in these vessels. The obtuse margin of the heart was akinetic and the left ventricle was dilated with overall moderate function. At eighteen month follow up the patient is clinically well being active and experiencing only mild dyspnoea on exertion (NYHA II).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"age\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 93,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[[77.0, 'year']]\",\n          \"[[44.0, 'year']]\",\n          \"[[5.0, 'year']]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"M\",\n          \"F\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pub_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2006-04\",\n          \"2002\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"PROBLEM\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 692,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['unexplained progressive weight gain', 'facial plethora', 'tremor', 'sweating', 'hypertension', 'hypokalemia', 'diabetes mellitus', 'thyroid enlargement', 'cushingoid features', 'striae', 'moon face', 'central obesity', 'a buffalo hump', 'hyperthyroidism', 'a multinodular goiter', 'increased uptake in an area of the left thyroid gland', 'an autonomous adenoma', 'significantly elevated', 'elevated', 'ectopic ACTH', 'significant central-to-peripheral ACTH gradients', 'Ectopic ACTH syndrome', 'pulmonary and/or abdominal tumors', 'a tumor of 1 cm size', 'a small 3 mm hypointense and hypoenhancing lesion of the neurohypophysis', 'radiotracer enrichment in the left thyroid gland', 'the autonomous adenoma', 'faint focal octreotide enhancement in the abdomen', 'hyperthyroidism', 'an autonomous adenoma', 'an ACTH', 'endocrine tumor', 'a 2 mm sized benign nodule on the right side', '2 benign nodules', 'hyperthyroidism', 'hypercortisolism', 'elevated liver function tests', 'the pituitary lesion within the posterior lobe', 'the left-sided adrenal tumor', 'hypercortisolism', 'pituitary adenoma', 'the pituitary lesion', 'this lesion', 'hypercortisolism', 'diabetes insipidus', 'tracer accumulation', 'increased glucose metabolism of this abdominal area', 'a 21 \\u00d7 15 mm tumor mass', 'this tumor', 'smaller size', 'tumor', 'moderate uptake', 'the neuroendocrine tumor', 'this lesion', 'metastatic tissue', 'a primary neuroendocrine tumor', 'the abdominal 111In-pentetreotide enhancement', 'further tumor tissue', 'a well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the mesentery', 'The tumor', 'All removed lymph nodes', 'increased activity', 'type 2 diabetes', 'muscle mass']\",\n          \"['diffuse abdominal discomfort', 'acute abdominal pain', 'intestinal occlusion', 'a cystic mass', 'a retroperitoneal tumor', 'ascitic fluid', 'malignant cells', 'The tumor', 'disease']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"TEST\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 673,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Her vital signs', 'a temperature', 'a heart rate', 'a blood pressure', 'cardiac examination', 'the evaluation', 'laboratory examinations', 'a white blood cell count', 'cells', 'mm3', 'an erythrocyte sedimentation time', 'a reactive C protein', 'three peripheral blood culture', 'A Transthoracic echocardiography', 'TTE', '3 blood cultures', 'a transesophageal echocardiography', 'TEE', 'The TEE']\",\n          \"['A CT scan of thorax and abdomen', 'the CT scan', 'A plain X-ray']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"TREATMENT\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 682,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Initial treatment', 'surgical removal', 'chemotherapy in line', 'vincristine', 'adriamycine', 'carboplatin', 'etoposide', 'actinomycin D', 'ifosfomide', 'surgical removal', 'chemotherapy', 'cerebral radiotherapy', 'treatment', 'gammaknife radiosurgery', 'radiosurgery', 'Surgery', 'surgery', 'chemotherapy', 'weekly Navelbine', 'daily Endoxan']\",\n          \"['Pharmacotherapy', 'drugs', 'Behavioural therapy', 'fluoxetine', 'fluoxetine', 'the medication', 'pharmacotherapy', 'delivery']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

\"A 58-year-old male was brought to the emergency room with confusion and an inability to speak for 1 day. He had a past history of hypertension and hypomania. He was single and he lived alone. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 80/63 mm of Hg, heart rate 126/minute, and temperature 102\\u00b0F. He was awake but unable to speak due to a mixed receptive and expressive aphasia. He had right homonymous hemianopsia and hemiplegia. Cardiac examination was positive for a pansystolic murmur in the apical area. The abdominal examination was unremarkable. On rectal examination there was perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone. Complete blood count showed WBC 15,400/mm3 with a left shift, hematocrit 49%, and normal platelets. Serum chemistries showed glucose 84 mg/dl, albumin 2.9 mg/dl, and calcium 8.5 mg/dl. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain, including diffusion weighted imaging, revealed acute hemorrhagic infarction of the left occipital lobe and acute embolic infarctions of the left frontal and right occipital lobes (Fig and ). Transesophageal Echocardiogram demonstrated mitral regurgitation and large vegetations on the posterior leaf of the mitral valve. Splenic and renal infarcts were visible on Computerized Tomography of the abdomen. All of the blood culture bottles and the urine culture grew methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment of the bacterial endocarditis was started with intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin. The patient had a significant recovery of speech and motor function within a few days. When asked about recent dental work, he gave a history of a tooth extraction 2\\u20133 days before the hospitalization but was unable to provide information about his dentist. A dentist from the hospital examined the patient and found no clinical evidence of the extraction. The patient underwent a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation. He displayed confabulation and perseverance (marriage, retirement, hospitalization were reported using the same date which was his birthday). He also had significant executive dysfunction including concrete thinking and poor insight regarding his health and cognitive problems. On hospital day 12 the patient had mitral valve replacement surgery using a bioprosthetic valve. He completed a six-week course of intravenous antibiotic treatment. He also underwent extensive rehabilitation therapy and was sent home after 8 weeks of hospitalization. On subsequent follow-up visits the patient showed complete recovery from the stroke and was back to his baseline. In response to questions about his sexual history the patient indicated having heterosexual relations with multiple partners. However, his answers were inconsistent and seemed unreliable.\\nA closer examination of his medical records revealed that two years prior to this hospitalization, the patient was admitted with a plastic soda bottle retained in the rectosigmoid for 3 days. The bottle had been filled with warm water and inserted into his anal canal for sexual stimulation. It slipped all the way into the rectum and could not be retrieved. His attempts to extract it at home were unsuccessful. In the emergency room his physical examination was normal except for a palpable mass in the suprapubic area, decreased anal sphincter tone and a dilated rectal vault. On X-ray of the abdomen, the outline of a plastic bottle was visible in the rectosigmoid (Fig ). The patient was taken to the operating room and under spinal anesthesia the bottle was extracted. He had multiple lacerations of the rectal mucosa but there was no perforation. He went home the next day. On follow-up visits to primary care he was noted to be overall healthy except having mild hypertension. His behavior was indicative of hypomania, but he did not get a formal psychiatric evaluation.\\nForeign bodies in the rectum and methods of their extraction have been amply chronicled in the surgical literature []. Sexual stimulation is the reason in a majority of these cases []. Local trauma, perforation, and resultant peritonitis are well known complications []. An unlimited PUBMED search for articles on bacteremia or endocarditis related to rectal foreign body insertion was unfruitful (We tried MeSH terms anal/rectal/colorectal/foreign bodies/anorectal /sexual deviation for the purpose). Bacteremia and septicemia from barium enema [], and therapeutic anal dilatation [] have been published. Procedures like fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy are known to cause endocarditis [], but septic stroke resulting from endocarditis related to lower gastrointestinal instrumentation has also not been reported.\\nThe patient's history of anorectal insertion of a plastic soda bottle for sexual gratification is consistent with published reports of use of large objects for this purpose []. The resultant rectal trauma can easily lead to bacteremia. Rectal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is well documented and is a potential source of infection []. This organism tends to be more abundant on the rectal mucosa than within the feces []. In a study of gastrointestinal colonization, Staphylococcus aureus grew from the culture of rectal swabs in 60% cases versus 53% positive culture of nasal swabs taken from the same subjects []. This organism is known to cause endocarditis of normal heart valves [,]. Neurologic complications of infective endocarditis, particularly embolic events, tend to be higher in cases of endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus [].\\nIt is known that few patients with rectal foreign bodies will freely admit to transanal introduction []. This explains to some extent the paucity of literature linking this practice with bacteremia or endocarditis. We believe our patient was habituated to rectal insertion of foreign bodies and that is evident from his previous history along with the clinical findings of perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone []. In the absence of a reliable history from the patient, the link between endocarditis and rectal trauma in this case is based on circumstantial evidence. A further study of patients with well-documented evidence of rectal foreign body insertion could be the next step to explore this important observation.\",\n          \"A 66-year-old female was admitted to our Institution with a history of a painless left preauricular nodule that had gradually increased in size. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a 2 \\u00d7 2.5 cm solid lesion in the left parotid gland. Cervical and peri-aortic lymph nodes were not enlarged, except for one in the submandibular region.\\nTotal parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve was performed. Thus, the parotid gland and covering skin were removed. Lateral jugular lymph nodes dissection was carried out.\\nThe lesion was initially examined in frozen sections. The specimen was submitted for histology and after fixation in formalin solution and inclusion in paraffin, 3\\u20135 \\u03bcm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for conventional evaluation and a Periodic acid Schiff stain also carried out. A panel of immunostains, including antibodies against mitochondrial antigen, keratin (Citok AE1, Citok AE3), carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA), vimentin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, smooth muscle actin and S-100, was applied to representative sections of the tumour using the avidin-biotin complex technique (Table ). Formalin-fixed small fragments of neoplasm were also examined by electron microscopy, after washing in 0,1 M phosphate buffer, postfixation in osmium tetroxide, dehydratation in ethanol and embedding in epon-araldite.\\nUltrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips EM 208 electronic microscope.\",\n          \"A 47 year old man presented to the Emergency department with central chest pain. Lateral myocardial infarction (MI) was confirmed by typical changes in leads I, AVL and V6 and raised troponin T levels. The patient was not thombolysed. He was haemodynamically stable initially and a coronary angiogram was contemplated. However, before this could be performed, he developed further chest pain and became haemodynamically unstable with tachycardia, hypotension and collapse (at 48 hours). An urgent trans- thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a pericardial effusion. Left ventricular (LV) free wall rupture was suspected. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed which confirmed this, as well as a large pericardial effusion (figure ). He was transferred from the referring hospital to the nearest cardiothoracic centre (one hour journey) for surgical repair. On arrival, it was felt that he would not have survived a trip to the catheter lab. A peri-operative trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) demonstrated pericardial tamponade and left ventricular free wall rupture in the region supplied by the circumflex artery. Surgery was performed via a median sternotomy. A large amount of blood and clot was removed from the pericardium with immediate haemodynamic improvement. A large recent infarction was identified involving the obtuse margin of the heart. This part of the myocardium was typically oedematous and fragile. At the centre of the infarcted area blood spurted from a small hole in the left ventricular free wall. The pericardium was sutured bilaterally to the skin edges and the heart was gently lifted placing large swabs behind it for surgical exposure. Surgery was performed on the beating heart without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The LV wall defect was repaired with Gelatine-Resorcin-Formalin (GRF glue: Cardial, Saint-Etienne, France) applied to a 6 cm diameter bovine pericardial patch (Impra, Tempe, Arizona, USA). This sutureless technique was repeated four times using overlapping patches of bovine pericardium to ensure coverage of the surrounding infarcted area of the left ventricular free wall. After ensuring adequate hemostasis, the heart was replaced into the pericardial sac. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP, Datascope, Oakland, NJ, USA) was inserted electively after the procedure to reduce cardiac after-load. Post-operatively, the patient returned to the intensive therapy unit in a stable condition without inotropic support. The patient was successfully extubated twelve hours post-operatively and remained haemodynamically stable. Loss from the chest drains was modest (440 mls in 24 hours). The IABP was removed two days after surgery. The rest of the post-operative course was uneventful. There was no evidence of end-organ injury. A pre-discharge trans-thoracic echocardiogram did not show any leak of blood across the ventricular repair. There was minimal pericardial effusion and moderate left ventricular ejection fraction with no valvular abnormalities. The patient was discharged home on the fifth post-operative day. Subsequent investigation with coronary angiogram and magnetic resonance imaging scan have shown complete occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery. Irregularities were seen in the left anterior and right coronary arteries but there were no significant stenoses in these vessels. The obtuse margin of the heart was akinetic and the left ventricle was dilated with overall moderate function. At eighteen month follow up the patient is clinically well being active and experiencing only mild dyspnoea on exertion (NYHA II).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"age\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 93,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[[77.0, 'year']]\",\n          \"[[44.0, 'year']]\",\n          \"[[5.0, 'year']]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"M\",\n          \"F\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"stanza_condition\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 692,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['unexplained progressive weight gain', 'facial plethora', 'tremor', 'sweating', 'hypertension', 'hypokalemia', 'diabetes mellitus', 'thyroid enlargement', 'cushingoid features', 'striae', 'moon face', 'central obesity', 'a buffalo hump', 'hyperthyroidism', 'a multinodular goiter', 'increased uptake in an area of the left thyroid gland', 'an autonomous adenoma', 'significantly elevated', 'elevated', 'ectopic ACTH', 'significant central-to-peripheral ACTH gradients', 'Ectopic ACTH syndrome', 'pulmonary and/or abdominal tumors', 'a tumor of 1 cm size', 'a small 3 mm hypointense and hypoenhancing lesion of the neurohypophysis', 'radiotracer enrichment in the left thyroid gland', 'the autonomous adenoma', 'faint focal octreotide enhancement in the abdomen', 'hyperthyroidism', 'an autonomous adenoma', 'an ACTH', 'endocrine tumor', 'a 2 mm sized benign nodule on the right side', '2 benign nodules', 'hyperthyroidism', 'hypercortisolism', 'elevated liver function tests', 'the pituitary lesion within the posterior lobe', 'the left-sided adrenal tumor', 'hypercortisolism', 'pituitary adenoma', 'the pituitary lesion', 'this lesion', 'hypercortisolism', 'diabetes insipidus', 'tracer accumulation', 'increased glucose metabolism of this abdominal area', 'a 21 \\u00d7 15 mm tumor mass', 'this tumor', 'smaller size', 'tumor', 'moderate uptake', 'the neuroendocrine tumor', 'this lesion', 'metastatic tissue', 'a primary neuroendocrine tumor', 'the abdominal 111In-pentetreotide enhancement', 'further tumor tissue', 'a well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the mesentery', 'The tumor', 'All removed lymph nodes', 'increased activity', 'type 2 diabetes', 'muscle mass']\",\n          \"['diffuse abdominal discomfort', 'acute abdominal pain', 'intestinal occlusion', 'a cystic mass', 'a retroperitoneal tumor', 'ascitic fluid', 'malignant cells', 'The tumor', 'disease']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"stanza_test\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 673,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Her vital signs', 'a temperature', 'a heart rate', 'a blood pressure', 'cardiac examination', 'the evaluation', 'laboratory examinations', 'a white blood cell count', 'cells', 'mm3', 'an erythrocyte sedimentation time', 'a reactive C protein', 'three peripheral blood culture', 'A Transthoracic echocardiography', 'TTE', '3 blood cultures', 'a transesophageal echocardiography', 'TEE', 'The TEE']\",\n          \"['A CT scan of thorax and abdomen', 'the CT scan', 'A plain X-ray']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"stanza_treatment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 682,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Initial treatment', 'surgical removal', 'chemotherapy in line', 'vincristine', 'adriamycine', 'carboplatin', 'etoposide', 'actinomycin D', 'ifosfomide', 'surgical removal', 'chemotherapy', 'cerebral radiotherapy', 'treatment', 'gammaknife radiosurgery', 'radiosurgery', 'Surgery', 'surgery', 'chemotherapy', 'weekly Navelbine', 'daily Endoxan']\",\n          \"['Pharmacotherapy', 'drugs', 'Behavioural therapy', 'fluoxetine', 'fluoxetine', 'the medication', 'pharmacotherapy', 'delivery']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He had a past history of hypertension and hypomania. He was single and he lived alone. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 80/63 mm of Hg, heart rate 126/minute, and temperature 102\\u00b0F. He was awake but unable to speak due to a mixed receptive and expressive aphasia. He had right homonymous hemianopsia and hemiplegia. Cardiac examination was positive for a pansystolic murmur in the apical area. The abdominal examination was unremarkable. On rectal examination there was perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone. Complete blood count showed WBC 15,400/mm3 with a left shift, hematocrit 49%, and normal platelets. Serum chemistries showed glucose 84 mg/dl, albumin 2.9 mg/dl, and calcium 8.5 mg/dl. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain, including diffusion weighted imaging, revealed acute hemorrhagic infarction of the left occipital lobe and acute embolic infarctions of the left frontal and right occipital lobes (Fig and ). Transesophageal Echocardiogram demonstrated mitral regurgitation and large vegetations on the posterior leaf of the mitral valve. Splenic and renal infarcts were visible on Computerized Tomography of the abdomen. All of the blood culture bottles and the urine culture grew methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment of the bacterial endocarditis was started with intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin. The patient had a significant recovery of speech and motor function within a few days. When asked about recent dental work, he gave a history of a tooth extraction 2\\u20133 days before the hospitalization but was unable to provide information about his dentist. A dentist from the hospital examined the patient and found no clinical evidence of the extraction. The patient underwent a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation. He displayed confabulation and perseverance (marriage, retirement, hospitalization were reported using the same date which was his birthday). He also had significant executive dysfunction including concrete thinking and poor insight regarding his health and cognitive problems. On hospital day 12 the patient had mitral valve replacement surgery using a bioprosthetic valve. He completed a six-week course of intravenous antibiotic treatment. He also underwent extensive rehabilitation therapy and was sent home after 8 weeks of hospitalization. On subsequent follow-up visits the patient showed complete recovery from the stroke and was back to his baseline. In response to questions about his sexual history the patient indicated having heterosexual relations with multiple partners. However, his answers were inconsistent and seemed unreliable.\\nA closer examination of his medical records revealed that two years prior to this hospitalization, the patient was admitted with a plastic soda bottle retained in the rectosigmoid for 3 days. The bottle had been filled with warm water and inserted into his anal canal for sexual stimulation. It slipped all the way into the rectum and could not be retrieved. His attempts to extract it at home were unsuccessful. In the emergency room his physical examination was normal except for a palpable mass in the suprapubic area, decreased anal sphincter tone and a dilated rectal vault. On X-ray of the abdomen, the outline of a plastic bottle was visible in the rectosigmoid (Fig ). The patient was taken to the operating room and under spinal anesthesia the bottle was extracted. He had multiple lacerations of the rectal mucosa but there was no perforation. He went home the next day. On follow-up visits to primary care he was noted to be overall healthy except having mild hypertension. His behavior was indicative of hypomania, but he did not get a formal psychiatric evaluation.\\nForeign bodies in the rectum and methods of their extraction have been amply chronicled in the surgical literature []. Sexual stimulation is the reason in a majority of these cases []. Local trauma, perforation, and resultant peritonitis are well known complications []. An unlimited PUBMED search for articles on bacteremia or endocarditis related to rectal foreign body insertion was unfruitful (We tried MeSH terms anal/rectal/colorectal/foreign bodies/anorectal /sexual deviation for the purpose). Bacteremia and septicemia from barium enema [], and therapeutic anal dilatation [] have been published. Procedures like fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy are known to cause endocarditis [], but septic stroke resulting from endocarditis related to lower gastrointestinal instrumentation has also not been reported.\\nThe patient's history of anorectal insertion of a plastic soda bottle for sexual gratification is consistent with published reports of use of large objects for this purpose []. The resultant rectal trauma can easily lead to bacteremia. Rectal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is well documented and is a potential source of infection []. This organism tends to be more abundant on the rectal mucosa than within the feces []. In a study of gastrointestinal colonization, Staphylococcus aureus grew from the culture of rectal swabs in 60% cases versus 53% positive culture of nasal swabs taken from the same subjects []. This organism is known to cause endocarditis of normal heart valves [,]. Neurologic complications of infective endocarditis, particularly embolic events, tend to be higher in cases of endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus [].\\nIt is known that few patients with rectal foreign bodies will freely admit to transanal introduction []. This explains to some extent the paucity of literature linking this practice with bacteremia or endocarditis. We believe our patient was habituated to rectal insertion of foreign bodies and that is evident from his previous history along with the clinical findings of perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone []. In the absence of a reliable history from the patient, the link between endocarditis and rectal trauma in this case is based on circumstantial evidence. A further study of patients with well-documented evidence of rectal foreign body insertion could be the next step to explore this important observation.\",\n          \"A 66-year-old female was admitted to our Institution with a history of a painless left preauricular nodule that had gradually increased in size. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a 2 \\u00d7 2.5 cm solid lesion in the left parotid gland. Cervical and peri-aortic lymph nodes were not enlarged, except for one in the submandibular region.\\nTotal parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve was performed. Thus, the parotid gland and covering skin were removed. Lateral jugular lymph nodes dissection was carried out.\\nThe lesion was initially examined in frozen sections. The specimen was submitted for histology and after fixation in formalin solution and inclusion in paraffin, 3\\u20135 \\u03bcm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for conventional evaluation and a Periodic acid Schiff stain also carried out. A panel of immunostains, including antibodies against mitochondrial antigen, keratin (Citok AE1, Citok AE3), carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA), vimentin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, smooth muscle actin and S-100, was applied to representative sections of the tumour using the avidin-biotin complex technique (Table ). Formalin-fixed small fragments of neoplasm were also examined by electron microscopy, after washing in 0,1 M phosphate buffer, postfixation in osmium tetroxide, dehydratation in ethanol and embedding in epon-araldite.\\nUltrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips EM 208 electronic microscope.\",\n          \"A 47 year old man presented to the Emergency department with central chest pain. Lateral myocardial infarction (MI) was confirmed by typical changes in leads I, AVL and V6 and raised troponin T levels. The patient was not thombolysed. He was haemodynamically stable initially and a coronary angiogram was contemplated. However, before this could be performed, he developed further chest pain and became haemodynamically unstable with tachycardia, hypotension and collapse (at 48 hours). An urgent trans- thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a pericardial effusion. Left ventricular (LV) free wall rupture was suspected. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed which confirmed this, as well as a large pericardial effusion (figure ). He was transferred from the referring hospital to the nearest cardiothoracic centre (one hour journey) for surgical repair. On arrival, it was felt that he would not have survived a trip to the catheter lab. A peri-operative trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) demonstrated pericardial tamponade and left ventricular free wall rupture in the region supplied by the circumflex artery. Surgery was performed via a median sternotomy. A large amount of blood and clot was removed from the pericardium with immediate haemodynamic improvement. A large recent infarction was identified involving the obtuse margin of the heart. This part of the myocardium was typically oedematous and fragile. At the centre of the infarcted area blood spurted from a small hole in the left ventricular free wall. The pericardium was sutured bilaterally to the skin edges and the heart was gently lifted placing large swabs behind it for surgical exposure. Surgery was performed on the beating heart without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The LV wall defect was repaired with Gelatine-Resorcin-Formalin (GRF glue: Cardial, Saint-Etienne, France) applied to a 6 cm diameter bovine pericardial patch (Impra, Tempe, Arizona, USA). This sutureless technique was repeated four times using overlapping patches of bovine pericardium to ensure coverage of the surrounding infarcted area of the left ventricular free wall. After ensuring adequate hemostasis, the heart was replaced into the pericardial sac. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP, Datascope, Oakland, NJ, USA) was inserted electively after the procedure to reduce cardiac after-load. Post-operatively, the patient returned to the intensive therapy unit in a stable condition without inotropic support. The patient was successfully extubated twelve hours post-operatively and remained haemodynamically stable. Loss from the chest drains was modest (440 mls in 24 hours). The IABP was removed two days after surgery. The rest of the post-operative course was uneventful. There was no evidence of end-organ injury. A pre-discharge trans-thoracic echocardiogram did not show any leak of blood across the ventricular repair. There was minimal pericardial effusion and moderate left ventricular ejection fraction with no valvular abnormalities. The patient was discharged home on the fifth post-operative day. Subsequent investigation with coronary angiogram and magnetic resonance imaging scan have shown complete occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery. Irregularities were seen in the left anterior and right coronary arteries but there were no significant stenoses in these vessels. The obtuse margin of the heart was akinetic and the left ventricle was dilated with overall moderate function. At eighteen month follow up the patient is clinically well being active and experiencing only mild dyspnoea on exertion (NYHA II).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"age\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 93,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[[77.0, 'year']]\",\n          \"[[44.0, 'year']]\",\n          \"[[5.0, 'year']]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"M\",\n          \"F\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pub_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2006-04\",\n          \"2002\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"conditions\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 51,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['headache', 'nausea', 'dizziness', 'confusion', 'impaired thinking', 'memory impairment']\",\n          \"['headache', 'neck pain', 'right shoulder pain', 'insomnia']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"medications\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 33,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['enoxaparin sodium']\",\n          \"['intravenous nitrates', 'low molecular weight heparin', 'aspirin', 'clopidogrel', 'abciximab']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"history\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['homosexual', 'negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in prior 3 months']\",\n          \"['gravida-1 para-1', 'long-term peritoneal dialysis']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"extracted_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": null,\n        \"max\": null,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 0,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"extracted_age\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 17.963529881320692,\n        \"min\": 8.0,\n        \"max\": 79.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 44,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"extracted_gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": null,\n        \"max\": null,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 0,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "   'detailedDescription': 'Endoscopic ultrasonography is essential for diagnosing and treating biliary and pancreatic diseases. The total incidence of biliary and pancreatic diseases is as high as 121/100,000, causing about 14.3/100,000 deaths worldwide every year, posing a severe threat to the health and safety of all humanity. The biliopancreatic system is located deep in the abdominal cavity, which is relatively difficult to examine and lacks specific symptoms at the early stage of the disease. Hence, the prognosis is poor, and the five-year survival rate is low. Biliopancreatic ultrasound endoscopy can obtain the cross cross-section of the biliopancreatic system through ultrasonic detection, collect tissue samples for pathological biopsy through the puncture, and carry out operations such as flushing and drainage, radiofrequency ablation, abdominal ganglion block, and gastrojejunostomy. The device integrates detection and treatment. In terms of detection, endoscopic ultrasonography is close to the lesion tissue and can avoid influencing the abdominal cavity wall, gastrointestinal gas, and other organs. Compared with X-ray, CT, MRI, and different in vitro detection methods, endoscopic ultrasonography has technical advantages of high resolution, no ionizing radiation, and solid real-time performance. In terms of treatment, endoscopic ultrasound-guided puncture through natural lumen has the characteristics of minimally invasive, lower surgical risk and cost compared with surgical treatment, which can significantly improve the prognosis of patients with biliary and pancreatic diseases. Biliopancreatic endoscopic ultrasonography is essential for diagnosing and treating biliopancreatic system diseases.\\n\\nThe basis of endoscopic ultrasound diagnosis and treatment lies in the accurate identification and localization of lesions by ultrasound images. Ultrasound images are cross-section images of human tissues, mainly containing texture information that is difficult to be recognized by naked human eyes; for endoscopy, doctors lacking professional training and long-term practice, difficult to accurately identify the anatomical signs in the images, which significantly affects the accuracy of identification and localization of biliopancreatic lesions. Due to the low image recognition of ultrasonic endoscopy, the operation of ultrasonic endoscopy is difficult, and the training cycle is very long. Conventional European and American endoscopic ultrasound training programs lasted for three years, but in a clinical study, two-thirds of the physicians who participated in the standard training program failed to pass the ability assessment of endoscopic ultrasound. Although ultrasound endoscopy is one of the most sensitive methods for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, sensitivity (87.8%) is still significantly inadequate compared with optical endoscopy for the diagnosis of gastric cancer (96%) and colon cancer (97.1%). The existence of this problem means that the existing training in ultrasonic endoscopy needs to be optimized. In recent years, Artificial intelligence (AI) machine vision technology has developed rapidly and has been widely used in transportation, finance, medicine and other fields. Several studies have shown that the diagnostic ability of AI has surpassed that of human experts in some diseases, and some studies have confirmed the feasibility of the application of AI in endoscopic ultrasound image recognition. In a previous study, an artificial intelligence model was used to assist ultrasonic endoscopists in ultrasound film reading, which could significantly improve the accuracy of physicians in image positioning and anatomical marker segmentation. In the early stage, the investigators successfully constructed an artificial intelligence model-based ultrasonic endoscopy-assisted film reading system and named the modified system biliopancreatic Master. The system can realize real-time ultrasonic station recognition and anatomical mark recognition and provide doctors with corresponding operation techniques.'},\n",

\"A 58-year-old male was brought to the emergency room with confusion and an inability to speak for 1 day. He had a past history of hypertension and hypomania. He was single and he lived alone. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 80/63 mm of Hg, heart rate 126/minute, and temperature 102\\u00b0F. He was awake but unable to speak due to a mixed receptive and expressive aphasia. He had right homonymous hemianopsia and hemiplegia. Cardiac examination was positive for a pansystolic murmur in the apical area. The abdominal examination was unremarkable. On rectal examination there was perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone. Complete blood count showed WBC 15,400/mm3 with a left shift, hematocrit 49%, and normal platelets. Serum chemistries showed glucose 84 mg/dl, albumin 2.9 mg/dl, and calcium 8.5 mg/dl. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain, including diffusion weighted imaging, revealed acute hemorrhagic infarction of the left occipital lobe and acute embolic infarctions of the left frontal and right occipital lobes (Fig and ). Transesophageal Echocardiogram demonstrated mitral regurgitation and large vegetations on the posterior leaf of the mitral valve. Splenic and renal infarcts were visible on Computerized Tomography of the abdomen. All of the blood culture bottles and the urine culture grew methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment of the bacterial endocarditis was started with intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin. The patient had a significant recovery of speech and motor function within a few days. When asked about recent dental work, he gave a history of a tooth extraction 2\\u20133 days before the hospitalization but was unable to provide information about his dentist. A dentist from the hospital examined the patient and found no clinical evidence of the extraction. The patient underwent a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation. He displayed confabulation and perseverance (marriage, retirement, hospitalization were reported using the same date which was his birthday). He also had significant executive dysfunction including concrete thinking and poor insight regarding his health and cognitive problems. On hospital day 12 the patient had mitral valve replacement surgery using a bioprosthetic valve. He completed a six-week course of intravenous antibiotic treatment. He also underwent extensive rehabilitation therapy and was sent home after 8 weeks of hospitalization. On subsequent follow-up visits the patient showed complete recovery from the stroke and was back to his baseline. In response to questions about his sexual history the patient indicated having heterosexual relations with multiple partners. However, his answers were inconsistent and seemed unreliable.\\nA closer examination of his medical records revealed that two years prior to this hospitalization, the patient was admitted with a plastic soda bottle retained in the rectosigmoid for 3 days. The bottle had been filled with warm water and inserted into his anal canal for sexual stimulation. It slipped all the way into the rectum and could not be retrieved. His attempts to extract it at home were unsuccessful. In the emergency room his physical examination was normal except for a palpable mass in the suprapubic area, decreased anal sphincter tone and a dilated rectal vault. On X-ray of the abdomen, the outline of a plastic bottle was visible in the rectosigmoid (Fig ). The patient was taken to the operating room and under spinal anesthesia the bottle was extracted. He had multiple lacerations of the rectal mucosa but there was no perforation. He went home the next day. On follow-up visits to primary care he was noted to be overall healthy except having mild hypertension. His behavior was indicative of hypomania, but he did not get a formal psychiatric evaluation.\\nForeign bodies in the rectum and methods of their extraction have been amply chronicled in the surgical literature []. Sexual stimulation is the reason in a majority of these cases []. Local trauma, perforation, and resultant peritonitis are well known complications []. An unlimited PUBMED search for articles on bacteremia or endocarditis related to rectal foreign body insertion was unfruitful (We tried MeSH terms anal/rectal/colorectal/foreign bodies/anorectal /sexual deviation for the purpose). Bacteremia and septicemia from barium enema [], and therapeutic anal dilatation [] have been published. Procedures like fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy are known to cause endocarditis [], but septic stroke resulting from endocarditis related to lower gastrointestinal instrumentation has also not been reported.\\nThe patient's history of anorectal insertion of a plastic soda bottle for sexual gratification is consistent with published reports of use of large objects for this purpose []. The resultant rectal trauma can easily lead to bacteremia. Rectal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is well documented and is a potential source of infection []. This organism tends to be more abundant on the rectal mucosa than within the feces []. In a study of gastrointestinal colonization, Staphylococcus aureus grew from the culture of rectal swabs in 60% cases versus 53% positive culture of nasal swabs taken from the same subjects []. This organism is known to cause endocarditis of normal heart valves [,]. Neurologic complications of infective endocarditis, particularly embolic events, tend to be higher in cases of endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus [].\\nIt is known that few patients with rectal foreign bodies will freely admit to transanal introduction []. This explains to some extent the paucity of literature linking this practice with bacteremia or endocarditis. We believe our patient was habituated to rectal insertion of foreign bodies and that is evident from his previous history along with the clinical findings of perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone []. In the absence of a reliable history from the patient, the link between endocarditis and rectal trauma in this case is based on circumstantial evidence. A further study of patients with well-documented evidence of rectal foreign body insertion could be the next step to explore this important observation.\",\n          \"A 66-year-old female was admitted to our Institution with a history of a painless left preauricular nodule that had gradually increased in size. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a 2 \\u00d7 2.5 cm solid lesion in the left parotid gland. Cervical and peri-aortic lymph nodes were not enlarged, except for one in the submandibular region.\\nTotal parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve was performed. Thus, the parotid gland and covering skin were removed. Lateral jugular lymph nodes dissection was carried out.\\nThe lesion was initially examined in frozen sections. The specimen was submitted for histology and after fixation in formalin solution and inclusion in paraffin, 3\\u20135 \\u03bcm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for conventional evaluation and a Periodic acid Schiff stain also carried out. A panel of immunostains, including antibodies against mitochondrial antigen, keratin (Citok AE1, Citok AE3), carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA), vimentin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, smooth muscle actin and S-100, was applied to representative sections of the tumour using the avidin-biotin complex technique (Table ). Formalin-fixed small fragments of neoplasm were also examined by electron microscopy, after washing in 0,1 M phosphate buffer, postfixation in osmium tetroxide, dehydratation in ethanol and embedding in epon-araldite.\\nUltrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips EM 208 electronic microscope.\",\n          \"A 47 year old man presented to the Emergency department with central chest pain. Lateral myocardial infarction (MI) was confirmed by typical changes in leads I, AVL and V6 and raised troponin T levels. The patient was not thombolysed. He was haemodynamically stable initially and a coronary angiogram was contemplated. However, before this could be performed, he developed further chest pain and became haemodynamically unstable with tachycardia, hypotension and collapse (at 48 hours). An urgent trans- thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a pericardial effusion. Left ventricular (LV) free wall rupture was suspected. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed which confirmed this, as well as a large pericardial effusion (figure ). He was transferred from the referring hospital to the nearest cardiothoracic centre (one hour journey) for surgical repair. On arrival, it was felt that he would not have survived a trip to the catheter lab. A peri-operative trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) demonstrated pericardial tamponade and left ventricular free wall rupture in the region supplied by the circumflex artery. Surgery was performed via a median sternotomy. A large amount of blood and clot was removed from the pericardium with immediate haemodynamic improvement. A large recent infarction was identified involving the obtuse margin of the heart. This part of the myocardium was typically oedematous and fragile. At the centre of the infarcted area blood spurted from a small hole in the left ventricular free wall. The pericardium was sutured bilaterally to the skin edges and the heart was gently lifted placing large swabs behind it for surgical exposure. Surgery was performed on the beating heart without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The LV wall defect was repaired with Gelatine-Resorcin-Formalin (GRF glue: Cardial, Saint-Etienne, France) applied to a 6 cm diameter bovine pericardial patch (Impra, Tempe, Arizona, USA). This sutureless technique was repeated four times using overlapping patches of bovine pericardium to ensure coverage of the surrounding infarcted area of the left ventricular free wall. After ensuring adequate hemostasis, the heart was replaced into the pericardial sac. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP, Datascope, Oakland, NJ, USA) was inserted electively after the procedure to reduce cardiac after-load. Post-operatively, the patient returned to the intensive therapy unit in a stable condition without inotropic support. The patient was successfully extubated twelve hours post-operatively and remained haemodynamically stable. Loss from the chest drains was modest (440 mls in 24 hours). The IABP was removed two days after surgery. The rest of the post-operative course was uneventful. There was no evidence of end-organ injury. A pre-discharge trans-thoracic echocardiogram did not show any leak of blood across the ventricular repair. There was minimal pericardial effusion and moderate left ventricular ejection fraction with no valvular abnormalities. The patient was discharged home on the fifth post-operative day. Subsequent investigation with coronary angiogram and magnetic resonance imaging scan have shown complete occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery. Irregularities were seen in the left anterior and right coronary arteries but there were no significant stenoses in these vessels. The obtuse margin of the heart was akinetic and the left ventricle was dilated with overall moderate function. At eighteen month follow up the patient is clinically well being active and experiencing only mild dyspnoea on exertion (NYHA II).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

              "'A 34-year old woman was referred for consideration of percutaneous ASD closure. The ASD had been diagnosed when the patient was 12 years old and TTE had suggested that the right ventricle was dilating. At cardiac catheterisation there were mildly elevated right ventricular systolic pressures and a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of over two. The secundum ASD was estimated to be 15 mm wide using TTE with aneurysmal formation of the interatrial septum. The patient was admitted for percutaneous ASD closure and underwent uncomplicated placement of a 17 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during the procedure revealed the presence of a second ASD near the inferior vena cava and a small post-procedure shunt. The septal occluder did not completely cover both defects. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose (assuming a single posteroanterior projection chest x-ray is eight centi-Gray/cm2) was 400. Repeat TTE continued to demonstrate left to right shunting and the patient was readmitted for a further device closure six months later. At cardiac catheterisation, the second defect was identified low in the secundum septum between the fossa ovalis and the mouth of the coronary sinus. The defect was successfully closed with a 9 mm Amplatzer septal occluder with no evidence of obstructed flow in either the coronary sinus or the inferior vena cava. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the second procedure was 187. The patient remained well with no evidence of residual shunt six months following the procedure.'"
